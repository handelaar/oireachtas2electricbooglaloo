      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Allen. I call on Deputy Allen to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to discuss the failure of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to disclose that blood from three persons who developed classical CJD was given to 20 patients and the need to publish the Flynn report on the IBTS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we decide on the proposals, I respectfully suggest an amendment to Standing Orders. The Dáil, on rising tomorrow, will not adjourn until Wednesday, 3 October 2001, the plenary session of the House will adjourn tomorrow. There are committees scheduled for next week and the following week, and there will be committee sessions of the Dáil through September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incorrect and damaging to give the impression that we are leaving this place until 3 October. Will the Government amend the order, as I cannot do so, to suggest that the plenary session of the Dáil shall adjourn tomorrow until 2.30 p.m. on 3 October?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the late sitting because of the gross mismanagement of the floor time of the House in the past three weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only started. I am just correcting Deputy Woods. There are 11 proposals on the Order of Business today, 11 requests to depart from the norm. We were asked over the past few weeks to ram through legislation in a most unprecedented and anti-democratic manner. We oppose the proposed late sitting until 6 p.m., which is not late enough in some respects, because of the way in which business is being proposed and the failure of the Government to consult properly with the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the proposal is for a late sitting because the schedule for the week states that 7 p.m. is the time the Dáil is to conclude today. We are now being asked to agree to 6 p.m. I wonder if we can honour the time that has been established. I object to sitting until 6 p.m. because very important legislation, the Sustainable Energy Bill, could be dealt with over the summer if it got through the plenary session &ndash; this was mentioned at a committee. However, the Bill is not going through because we are told there is not time. There is time. Can we have a genuine late sitting to allow Second Stage of that Bill to be taken rather than have an early adjournment today, because the weekly schedule states 7 p.m., not 6 p.m.</P>

      <P>As there will be no Order of Business tomorrow, I take the opportunity to wish the Government well in its negotiations. I hope the Good Friday Agreement will be implemented in full over the next six weeks. I wish the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs well, and all the officials who are participating in the talks.</P>

      <P>The House is aware that the Government has refused to grant an adequate fee increase to RTE and has caused consternation among staff in RTE where 700 staff met yesterday. The Government claims the decision is based on a consultants' report which was commissioned by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Can the Minister confirm my understanding that none of the managers in the key output areas of news and current affairs in television or radio was consulted by the consultants and that the consultancy was simply based on financial information submitted? While the accountancy and financial side were consulted, none of the programme makers was. Does the Minister intend to press ahead with this proposal which is so damaging to the interest of public sector broadcasting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this matter ratified by the Cabinet? In the course of the analysis undertaken by the Government, was the Government aware <Col N="715" /> that there are 100,000 subscribers to Sky Digital TV and that the intention of the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting is not to return to the issue of digitalisation until 2003, by which time Rupert Murdoch will own the Irish skies and the control of much of the media coming through our screens will be determined by editors outside the jurisdiction with no cultural linkage to what is going on here? Is the Government committed to publishing the PricewaterhouseCoopers consultancy report, which second guessed the management and the authority &ndash; an authority appointed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and which meets tomorrow &ndash; as to what is in the best interests of the national broadcasting agency? </P>
      <P>Can we conclude from the slapping down of the ESB earlier this week and the under-pricing and devaluing of the effectiveness of RTE to do its job, that we are now looking at the takeover by the mad mullahs of the right in Fianna Fáil who are determined to stamp out State enterprise?</P>

      <P>I was hoping to have asked her but I now have to ask the Minister for Education and Science if he can indicate whether there is still in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment the early warning unit to deal with threatened redundancies and jobs at risk, in light of the fact that since January 2001 there have been 21,000 redundancies. For example 400 jobs have been lost at ISPAT, Cobh, County Cork; 130 at Wexford Weavers; 150 at Wexal, Enniscorthy, County Wexford; 104 at GlaxoSmithKline, Dungarvan; 400 at Zerox, Dundalk; 60 at Peerless Rugs, Athy; 200 at Henniges, Ballina; 150 at Guinness, Dunalk; 200 at Low Alpine, Tullamore; 260 at Thermo King; 85 at Studio Eye Wear, Ennis. There were job losses also at Dawn Dairies and at Intel there is the possibility of that flagship company being shut down for a number of months. As we speak, up to 4,300 jobs have gone in Intel, including the loss of 1,500 construction jobs and others which did not come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's estimate is for 15,000 redundancies this year. If the present trend continues that figure is likely to be in excess of 40,000. International quarterly statistics from various econom<Col N="720" /> ies, including the US, which would have a key impact on the performance of the Irish economy in terms of employment would not augur well for employment. In many cases the jobs being lost are of a scale and skill level which will make it virtually impossible for those unfortunate workers to find alternative employment. Because of the incompetence of this Government and particularly the Minister for Public Enterprise, the lack of infrastructure, broad-band technology, high quality levels of energy, including electricity, or access to a proper infrastructure and transport system mean replacement industries will not come to the locations where the jobs in question have been lost. Against that very dismal background which I take no pleasure in describing, will the Minister for Education and Science state what the Government is going to do in general and, specifically, can he confirm that the early warning unit is in operation and that it is currently looking at other jobs which are at risk around the country?</P>

      <P>A dramatic improvement will be seen, and it will be very noticeable. In relation to employment and unemployment, we must be prepared to deal with the highly competitive situation in which we are now working. In the past four years, there has been an increase of about 310,000 in the number of people at work. Even in the past 12 months, there has been a net increase of 70,000 jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very successful period. When the leader of the Labour Party was in Government with his colleagues across the way, unemployment ran at 11% and it is now down to 3%. Notwithstanding all of that development, I accept the points made and I understand the unit is still there. Obviously, it did not need to be called into action much over the recent period but I presume it can be back into action fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the future, Deputy Noonan referred to indigenous growth and development and our performance generally. CSO figures have shown that our performance has been outstanding, with a 10.4% growth rate. If we want to keep that going, we have to maintain the indigenous industry. In that context, our research based industry here at home is critical. The Government's allocation of very substantial funds in that direction, in consultation with the social partners, will help to assure our future. There will be changes. A proportion of the more repetitive jobs may go to other countries. For instance, in the case of Apple in Cork, some of the manufacturing has gone to other countries such as Taiwan and the Czech Republic, yet the sector has maintained substantial figures by basing in Ireland its European finance and sales operations. Intel's research base is being developed and the company is looking for people with those skills. I accept the Deputy's point that we have to be vigilant and must work hard to stay in a competitive position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In your absence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister gave a scintillating performance, answering all kinds of questions which had not been asked. May I finally ask him if the Government recognises that there are two economies operating in tandem in the Irish economy at present? The high-tech, predominantly foreign multinational investment driven, and financial services are steaming ahead, but in many provincial towns, some of them in South Tipperary, industries are contracting and jobs are at risk due to a variety of factors which make those companies uncompetitive. Some of those factors are domestically controlled by the policies of this Govern<Col N="722" /> ment. Will the Minister begin to recognise that, within the broad figures of economic performance which he has cited and which are to be welcomed in some respects, there are many individual tragic stories of companies going to the wall? Workers with, perhaps, less than a leaving certificate education but 20 years of industrial experience will not, given the present employment situation, get another job in their home town. I have read the list. If Fianna Fáil has learned anything from the by-election in South Tipperary, surely it must realise that these Irish workers in indigenous companies, with skill levels which will not find redeployment in the financial services sector at the Custom House Docks, have to be contacted, analysed, helped and assisted to move up the skills chain. What, if anything, is this Government doing other than blathering on about record economic performance when the reality on the ground is that jobs are being lost? </P>

The Tribunal shall, subject to paragraphs I and L, consist of, from a date to be specified by   instrument made pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998 by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, not more than three full members one of whom shall be the Honourable Mr. Justice Feargus M.

The Minister for the Environment and Local Government shall also appoint a fourth person as a reserve member of the Tribunal to hear evidence with a view to such person being appointed a full member of the Tribunal in the event that any member of the Tribunal is, for any reason, unable to continue to act; in such circumstances, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government shall, by instrument made pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998 appoint such fourth person a full member of the Tribunal and such person shall be deemed to have been a full member of the Tribunal from the date the three member Tribunal was appointed, which date shall be specified in any such instrument made pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998 by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

    <P>Pursuant to resolutions in both Houses of the Oireachtas in October 1997, a tribunal of inquiry with Mr. Justice Feargus M. Flood as its sole member, was set up to inquire into certain planning matters. The sole member reported to the Clerk of the Dáil on 26 February 1998 and sought the terms of reference be changed to allow the tribunal to investigate matters which occurred prior to 20 June 1985. The terms of reference were expanded by resolution of both Houses in June 1998 to allow for this amendment. The terms of reference were also amended at the same time to extend the remit of the tribunal to inquire into all substantial payments made or benefits provided, directly or indirectly for whatever purpose or with whatever motive, to Mr. Raphael Burke. The motion further amends the terms of reference of the tribunal by increasing the membership of the tribunal. The scope of the <Col N="733" /> tribunal is not being altered, but it will become a three member tribunal.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Feargus Flood wrote to the Clerk of the Dail on 13 June 2001 outlining the progress of the tribunal to date. He indicated his intention to submit final reports to the Oireachtas, not later than September of this year, in respect of the payment of money to Mr. Raphael Burke by Mr. James Gogarty, the decisions taken by Mr. Raphael Burke in connection with Century Communications Limited, the payments made to Mr. Raphael Burke by or on behalf of Mr. Thomas Brennan and Mr. Joseph McGowan and-or companies with which they were associated.</P>
    <P>He also indicated that he will not commence taking further evidence until he has first rendered his reports to the Oireachtas. Mr. Justice Flood has indicated that investigations into rezoning decisions are currently being made. However, he has stated that there are, in addition, other substantive issues which appear to merit public inquiry. These inquiries will, in some instances, be greater in scale and more complex than the inquiries already concluded by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the multiplicity of the issues involved in these inquiries, and the anticipated workload, Mr. Justice Flood requested in accordance with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998, that the terms of reference be amended by providing for the nomination of two further persons to be members of the tribunal to the intent that the tribunal would cease to be a tribunal comprising a sole member and would become a three member tribunal under his chairmanship and further by the nomination of a further person to sit with the tribunal to hear evidence with the view to such person being available to become a member of the tribunal in the event that any existing member of the tribunal, for any reason, is unable to continue to act.</P>
    <P>The Government is wholly committed to providing the tribunal with the resources it requires to carry out effectively the work set out in its terms of reference. The formal request by the tribunal has been the subject of extensive consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in accordance with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998. The outcome of these discussions is set out in the resolution today. The tribunal has given its consent to the proposed amendment of the terms of reference in accordance with the Act and the formal consent has been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will, therefore, become a three member tribunal. During these discussions with the tribunal and the Attorney General, it was agreed that the fourth person sought by the sole member, who would sit with the tribunal to hear evidence, would be appointed as a reserve member. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will appoint, by instrument, such person as a full member of the tribunal in the <Col N="734" /> event that any member of the tribunal is for, for any reason, unable to continue to act. The reserve member will sit in the hearing chamber and observe all proceedings, will review all written evidence and will attend tribunal discussions as an observer but will not contribute to the tribunal's decision or seek to influence these in any way. The reserve member will, accordingly, be fully versed in all evidence before the tribunal should future events make it necessary for the reserve member to be appointed a full member of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The amended terms of reference also deal with a number of procedural or consequential issues. In the event that the chairperson, for any reason, is unable to act, the Minister can by instrument, designate another member of the tribunal as chairperson. If it is necessary for the reserve member to be appointed a full member of the tribunal, and subsequently one or two members are for any reason unable to continue to act, or if for any reason the former reserve member is unable to act, it is provided that the tribunal may continue to act as a two member or sole member tribunal as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Although it is not anticipated that any of these situations will arise, the new provisions are being included because of the importance of the work being undertaken by the tribunal and our common wish that this work be completed and its outcome published. It will also ensure that the investment made in the tribunal in terms of the efforts of the tribunal, time and money, has a result.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is consulting the tribunal with regard to the appointment of the two full members and the reserve member and the party leaders will be kept informed of developments.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, Mr. Justice Flood will not commence the taking of further evidence until he has first submitted his final reports on the matters previously stated to the Oireachtas in September. It is intended that once these reports have been submitted, the Minister will make the instrument in accordance with the Act, setting up the three member tribunal with one reserve member. The instrument will name the new members. The instrument is not being made immediately to avoid any confusion between the work of the sole member and that of the three member tribunal.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I formally state our appreciation of the work being carried out by Mr. Justice Flood and his legal team at the tribunal, and I am sure I speak on all our behalf when I say I look forward to receiving his final reports on the matters currently being investigated by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has a concern which I share in relation to the integrity of the planning system. The passing of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, concluded a comprehensive review of the planning system which was initiated by the Minister. While the public set <Col N="735" /> high standards for the operation of the planning system, they demand even higher standards for those working in the system. The 2000 Act provides that over the coming year each planning authority must bring forward a code of conduct, setting the standards for the way we do business and reinforcing public confidence in the integrity of the system. These codes will also serve to provide clarity and certainty to everyone working in planning authorities by providing clear and unambiguous directions on what is and is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provisions of the Local Government Bill relating to ethics, which was passed in the Dáil last night, will replace those in the Planning and Development Act with respect to local authorities. Those provisions build on those of the Planning Act and will apply to the members and officials of local authorities, whether or not they are engaged in duties relating to planning. The Bill provides for a comprehensive ethics framework which is sufficiently transparent to discourage wrong doing and to encourage confidence in the local government system. The ethical provisions update and develop existing law and take account of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. They cover all local authority activity and relate equally to staff and members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The planning tribunal has a vital role in developing public confidence in the planning system. It has a very large task and it is important that it be discharged effectively and in a timely manner. I wish Mr. Justice Flood and the future members of the tribunal well in their task and hope with these additional resources, the tribunal will be able to meet the time frame set out in Mr. Justice Flood's letter of 13 June 2001. I commend the Resolution and the amended terms of reference to the House.</P>

      <P>This resolution, which comes on foot of a request from the sole member of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, is one Fine Gael unreservedly supports. I am only surprised that this request did not come much sooner. As a former member of Dublin County Council, I am interested in this matter. The activities of Dublin County Council have already been the subject of investigation by the tribunal and I understand will form the basis of the next module of the tribunal's work, which I believe starts in September.</P>
      <P>The tribunal is a creature of this House. It was created by us on foot of allegations that were made, and made public at the time. It, therefore, behoves all of us to co-operate in full with the request made by Mr. Justice Flood and to do everything we can to facilitate its work and ensure it can successfully complete the task we have assigned to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be an exaggeration to say the matters that have already been revealed in the course of the work of the tribunal have initially shocked <Col N="736" /> us. We regarded them with almost disbelief and it gradually dawned on us with horror that this was something that went on almost systematically over many years. Unfortunately, it has cast a cloud over every politician and has undermined not just public confidence in us, but confidence in ourselves as protectors of the public interest and in our own ability to put in place processes and procedures, particularly in regard to the rezoning of land which would safeguard the integrity of this system and ensure that the system cannot be manipulated by any of the participants, whether elected or unelected, for their own selfish gain and completely contrary to the common good.</P>
    <P>If the tribunal has taught us anything, in its first four years, it is that the system of land rezoning and the making of development plans is wide open to abuse. Unfortunately, all the evidence is that the system has been badly abused over the years. I would not entirely agree with the Minister in that despite the raft of legislation we have put in place &ndash; I accept much legislation has been put in place with the aim of trying to prevent a similar set of circumstances arising again &ndash; we have not gone far enough. The Planning and Development Bill put safeguards in the existing system but the system itself will have to change.</P>
    <P>The system has been abused and this, in turn, has cast not only a cloud over politicians but on planners and officials. In the majority of cases, this is hugely unfair to many of the decent people working in the local authority system but, inevitably, they too have all been drawn into this web. The lesson I draw from this is that the system must be changed to one which is transparent and operates exclusively in the public interest. That has not been clear to the majority of the public so far. This is not a matter for discussion today but making development plans is a vital function and it is fundamental to our economic, social and community development. It cannot remain a system which is suspect in the public mind.</P>
    <P>Such changes may well constitute some of the tribunal's recommendations but the issue must be addressed if we are to restore public confidence in the planning process. I accept the Minister's comments on legislation passed in an attempt to prevent these abuses arising. The most significant and serious fall-out from the tribunal's revelations is the complete undermining and almost total erosion of public confidence in the political process. This strikes at the very heart of our democracy and will be far more difficult to fix than the planning system, if it can ever be fixed.</P>
    <P>Irish people always had a healthy cynicism about politicians but the current cynicism borders on total contempt. A politician's every action, decision and opinion is accorded the lowest possible motivation. That any of us may have at heart the common good or may be motivated by a desire for public service is not even considered. This is utterly depressing and demoralising for the vast majority of decent, hardworking politicians on all sides of the House. It is particularly demoralising for local public representatives <Col N="737" /> throughout the country who sacrifice so much of their time and personal and family lives to serve their communities for no private gain and usually at great personal cost. This contribution is now regarded as being entirely self-serving. Our democracy is under threat as evidenced by low voter turn-outs, protest votes etc. which indicate people's withdrawal of their consent to be governed. If we are to restore public confidence, we must do all we can by way of legislation and assistance to the tribunal. The tribunal alone will not restore public confidence but it is a vital element in that restoration.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the tribunal completes its work &ndash; evidence hearings, deliberations and conclusions &ndash; speedily, efficiently and exhaustively and that its reports are acted upon. We must facilitate this in every way possible, however painful it may be. I am sure that when Mr. Justice Flood took on this task four years ago, he did not foresee it becoming so complex and multi-faceted. I share the concerns expressed at the growing cost of the tribunal but I am far more concerned that its work be satisfactorily completed. This House must not do anything, in terms of resources etc., to expose it to the risk of collapse.</P>
    <P>It is prudent of the sole member to request resources which will ensure that if for any reason he must withdraw from the tribunal or chooses to do so, its work will be able to proceed. This is an opportune time to examine the tribunal's structure and provide additional resources. The first three phases of investigation have been completed. I understand the sole member will complete his deliberations over the summer and issue a report in September prior to the next round of evidence. We should consider transforming the tribunal into a larger body, perhaps the three person tribunal recommended by Mr. Justice Flood. A sole member tribunal is perhaps better suited to the investigation of individual incidents or subjects. The tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters and payments has expanded far beyond what was originally envisaged and has taken the tribunal into areas it did not anticipate. The scope of its inquiry may require the more traditional three member tribunal.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Government's response to the sole member's request are slightly different to those advocated by Mr. Justice Flood who requested a three member tribunal with a reserve who would take over should any of the other members have to withdraw. Instead, the Government has provided for the appointment of a fourth person to the tribunal who would participate in its hearings but not its deliberations, except where one of the other members was required to withdraw. It is anticipated that the next phase will last for at least two years and will involve taking evidence from some 200 witnesses. This work load would exert huge pressure on the sole member and would undoubtedly extend the duration of the hearings, thereby increasing costs <Col N="738" /> to the taxpayer. Most important, it would endanger the tribunal's integrity.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Gilmore would allow me to briefly refer to the proposal for the expanded membership. I understand that any new tribunal members will not necessarily have to be members of the Judiciary but may be people experienced in acting in a quasi-judicial manner. However, I feel it is important that at least one of the members would be a judge. This is a very legalistic area of inquiry which has been subject to judicial review and in regard to which decisions must be made on costs etc. To the extent that the tribunal's expanded membership may reduce the number of judges operating in the rest of the justice system, I ask the Minister to ensure that any judges appointed to the tribunal would be replaced.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party supports this motion but the House is entitled to some explanation as to the manner in which the Government has handled Mr. Justice Flood's request for additional assistance. When the original request for assistance was made public on 13 June, the Labour Party issued a statement to the effect that the Oireachtas must respond positively to allow the tribunal to discharge the mandate given to it by the Dáil and Seanad in 1997. The statement continued:</P>
      <P>Only Mr. Justice Flood and his team are in a position to assess the level of work before them and determine the resources needed to deal with it. However, it is clear from the report sent to the Oireachtas today that the scale of the task facing Mr. Justice Flood is far greater and more daunting than had been realised in 1997. He has shown great commitment and determination in discharging his mandate and the Oireachtas must now respond to his request for further assistance.</P>
      <P>The tribunal, in its work to date, has discovered sufficient matters of serious public concern to more than justify the decision of the Oireachtas to set it up and the costs that have been incurred to date. The extra resources sought by Mr. Justice Flood will clearly add to the cost of the tribunal but if his investigations and findings contribute to the removal of any vestiges of corruption or dishonesty from public life, then it will be money well spent.</P>
      <P>There may well need to be some discussions between the Oireachtas and the tribunal in regard to technical or legal matters and this should be done as speedily as possible. In addition, it is important that the Government should adhere to the long established principle of consultation between the Government and the main Opposition parties in regard to the new appointments that must now be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> It must be emphasised that the request made by Mr. Justice Flood on 13 June was addressed to the Oireachtas and not to the Government. We expected full consultation with the other parties in the House before any response was made to Mr. Justice Flood. Deputy Howlin raised the matter in the House on 14 June with the Tánaiste who said &ldquo;the matter should be discussed with the other parties in the House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Despite the matter having been raised by our Whip at the Whips meetings and despite promises that there would be consultation with the other parties, there has been no consultation with the Labour Party. There was no consultation with the this party before the original motion appeared on the Order Paper on Tuesday, prior to it being withdrawn at lunchtime yesterday or before a totally new and dramatically different motion was circulated last evening. It also appears that there was no consultation with Mr. Justice Flood prior to the original motion appearing on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    <P>Late last week our Whip received a briefing note from the Department of the Environment and Local Government which stated, &ldquo;The Sole Member has made a formal request for the appointment of two further members to the Tribunal and the appointment of a further person to sit with the Tribunal to hear evidence with a view to that person being available to replace any member of the Tribunal who, for any reason, is unable to continue to act as a member of the Tribunal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The note goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has advised that the proposal to appoint a &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; i.e. a non-member to sit with the Tribunal is legally dubious. This request was made from Mr. Justice Flood on the understanding that such a non-member &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; was in place at the Saville Inquiry in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office has since clarified that the substitute in place is a reserve member of the Tribunal. With the exception of the latter proposal, it is intended to accede to the request of Mr. Justice Flood.</P>
    <P>When the original motion appeared on the Dáil Order Paper yesterday, it simply provided for the appointment of two additional members. It made no provision for the appointment of any substitute or reserve member. Extraordinarily, it did not even provide for the appointment of Mr. Justice Flood as the chairperson of the tribunal, a measure that was necessary as he would now no longer be the sole member.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise in regard to this motion. Why was Mr. Justice Flood's request for a substitute member apparently dismissed out of hand? What was the basis of the Attorney General's advice that this was &ldquo;legally dubious&rdquo;? Was there any consultation or discussion with Mr. Justice Flood prior to the tabling of the original motion? Was the consent of Mr. Justice Flood <Col N="740" /> obtained for the original motion, as required by section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998? Why was there no attempt in the original motion to meet the substance of Mr. Justice Flood's request for some cover in the event of a member of the tribunal being able to continue to function when this was done quite effectively in the second motion now before the House?</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Mr. Justice Flood laid a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas in which he gave his assent to the new motion circulated by the Government. We are, therefore, happy to support the motion. We are, however, entitled to some explanation from the Government as to the background to the events I outlined. It would appear, on the basis of what we know, that a motion was placed on the Dáil Order Paper by the Government without any consultation with the other parties and without the required assent of Mr. Justice Flood. If that is the case, it is unacceptable and a serious discourtesy, to say the least, to Mr. Justice Flood.</P>
    <P>We are also entitled to an explanation as to why the Government effectively ignored the fact that Mr. Justice Flood's report was made to the Oireachtas and not to the Government and why there was no consultation with the Opposition parties in advance of the tabling of these motions. We have been promised previously in this House that there will be full consultation in regard to the additional persons to be appointed to the tribunal. We expect that in this case the promise will be honoured. In that regard I raise a comment made by the Minister when presenting this motion. He stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to tell the House that the Attorney General is consulting with the tribunal with regard to the appointment of the two full members and the reserve member and the party Leaders will be kept informed of developments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is not consultation. I make it clear to the Minister that the Labour Party wants to be consulted about the appointment of the two additional members and the reserve member of this tribunal.</P>
    <P>I also question the timetable for the making of these appointments. The Minister indicated that it is not intended to make the appointments until after the sole member has made his report to the Oireachtas in September. My understanding of the request from Mr. Justice Flood was that he expressly sought that this matter would be dealt with by the Oireachtas prior to the summer recess to enable the appointments to be made and the work to progress. I am surprised that it is now proposed the appointments will not be made until after the report has been submitted by Mr. Justice Flood in September. That is a matter on which my party will wish to be consulted properly by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister laid some emphasis on the passing of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, <Col N="741" /> which he stated concluded a comprehensive review of the planning system that was instituted by the Minister. It is now a full year since the Planning and Development Act, 2000 was passed and approved as constitutional by the Supreme Court. It is a matter of great disappointment that the provisions of that Act, as they deal with the changes to the planning system, have not yet been commenced and that only a small portion of that Act has yet been commenced. It is ironic the Government is claiming credit for progress made on improvements to planning procedures contained in an Act the House passed a year ago and that was approved by the Supreme Court but has not yet been commenced by the Government.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is simple and straightforward. It is to amend section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, so that the Human Rights Commission to be formally established under its provisions shall consist of 15 members rather than nine members as originally envisaged in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the Government's original intention that this amendment should be included in section 7(<i>a</i>) of the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001. That Bill completed its Second Stage in this House on 14 June 2001 and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Committee on Justice, Equality, Women's Rights and Defence. The Convention Bill is designed to give further effect in Irish law to the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights. It is a matter that flows directly from the Good Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland. The establishment of the Human Rights Commission also has its originals in that agreement. The idea of dealing with the outstanding matter relating to the Commission in the Convention Bill stems mainly from that. In addition, there was the matter of timing following the review by both Governments of outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement in Hillsborough last year, which promised that full implementation of the outstanding aspects of the Agreement was to be achieved by June 2001. The Government had hoped, accordingly, that the provision to deal with the issue of commission membership could have been dealt with in the one Bill which would be enacted before the Summer recess. In that way I could <Col N="742" /> proceed to make the necessary Establishment Order under section 3 of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, immediately upon enactment of the Convention Bill.</P>
    <P>It was on this basis that I informed the President of the Human Rights Commission, Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, and the House in my replies to recent parliamentary questions, that I hoped to be in a position to establish the commission formally within this time limit. I also said that if the Convention Bill could not be processed within that time frame, I would proceed with the commission issue in a separate Bill. For reasons I will come to, it has not been possible to proceed as the Government had intended and that is why the Bill dealing solely with the increase in the number of members of the Human Rights Commission is now before us. I acknowledge that Deputies Shatter and Howlin had earlier indicated that they would support this split approach.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, before it goes on to consider the provisions of the Convention Bill proper on Committee Stage &ndash; which was originally scheduled for Tuesday last with Report and Final Stages to take place today &ndash; has decided to consult a wide range of organisations in the general human rights area who wish to comment on the proposals in the Bill. The committee has heard the views of only a few of the many organisations involved, including Amnesty International, The Children's Rights Alliance and the interim Human Rights Commission, as it has not proved to be possible within the time frame originally envisaged for enactment of the Bill to hear all the groups who wish to make observations and recommendations. Accordingly, Committee Stage has been deferred to allow consultations to take place in July and September. I have already expressed the wish that we can get back to deal with the Committee and Final Stages of the convention Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before us is required because the Government decided to increase the number of human rights commissioners to better meet the requirement in the Act that its members broadly reflect the nature of our society. This means that the Human Rights Commission now has 15 members in total, including its President, Mr. Justice Donal Barrington. All 15 members have been nominated by the Government and have accepted their offers of appointment. The Commission has been meeting now for some months as an interim body. However, this situation cannot be allowed to continue for much longer, and the enactment of this Bill will allow me to make the necessary Establishment day Order under section 3 of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, immediately. The commission can then proceed to develop fully its role and functions under the Act, including its participation in the important work in an all-Ireland context of the Joint Committee of Representatives with the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Although it is small, its consequences are very important, as the establishment of a Human Rights Commission on a formal basis is an important marker in any democracy or country; it is certainly an important marker for this country.</P>
      <P>It is now more than half a century since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 declared that it was essential that &ldquo;human rights should be protected by the rule of law&rdquo; and it is already ten years since the drafting of the Paris Principles in 1991, which recommended the creation of national institutions such as a Human Rights Commission: &ldquo;vested with competence to promote and protect human rights&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is now more than three years since the Multi-Party Agreement between the British and Irish Governments pledged to establish a Human Rights Commission in Ireland with a remit similar to that of Northern Ireland and to create a committee of the joint representatives of the two commissions.</P>
      <P>I welcome today's Bill, which is a belated recognition by the Minister that this is the way to go. We have said all along that it should not have been put in with the other legislation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights and that is what emerged in committee. I hope the way the Minister listened to the voices which suggested this was to go will be matched by his listening to the presentations in the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's' Rights, as very important points have been raised in the presentations already made, including that of Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, President of the new commission. I hope the Minister shows flexibility in accepting some of the recommendations being made in relation to the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights. It would be to the advantage of everyone in the country if he did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten months have passed since the announcement of a procedure for the appointment of human rights commissioners in this jurisdiction. Could there have been more delays? The delays have been unacceptable and wherever the Minister was getting his advice in relation to the establishment of the commission, some of it has been quite flawed. It was not necessary to go through the rather tortuous procedures which have emerged in the establishment of the commission. They were quite unnecessary and undermined the commitment of the Government and the House to establishing a human rights commission in an appropriate way. The President of the commission, Mr. Barrington, told the committee the other day that he felt almost as if we were afraid of incorporating strong human rights legislation in our country. He asked why we should be afraid. We have a strong Constitution and body <Col N="744" /> of law and he said we had nothing to be afraid of in incorporating the European Convention in the strongest way possible. That applies to a strong human rights commission as well.</P>
    <P>The importance of a human rights commission is that it repatriates into Ireland elements of an institutional expression of human rights protection. What is in Strasbourg, the Hague or Geneva or Luxembourg is brought closer to the citizen. At a moment of heightened feelings about the concept of European integration and globalisation, never has such a process been more necessary for the individual citizen. We saw in the debate about the Nice treaty, that people feel quite disconnected and if institutions such as a human rights commission can be made meaningful for individual citizens, that will go a long way towards dealing with that sense of disempowerment. I ask the Minister to look again at the Amnesty audit report on human rights in Ireland. Some of its suggestions about information and awareness and educating the public about human rights are very important. We have not done enough in that area in Ireland and I hope the Minister asks his Department and perhaps this new commission to come forward with some suggestions as to how best this might be done. It is one thing to pass legislation but to make that legislation meaningful for people is a different task and a big challenge.</P>
    <P>Opportunities to share North and South between the respective commissions have been lost and must be quickly made up. As the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: &ldquo;. . . whereas it is essential, if a man is not to be compelled to have recourse as a last resort to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights be protected by the rule of law . . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We may feel that does not apply in Ireland but one cannot be too careful about trying to create a strong culture of human rights. Ireland will now be able to join more than 50 countries who have already established human rights commissions. We are not ahead of the posse on this but quite slow, though it is good we are at this point now. Our written Constitution is already strong in some respects in its protection of individual rights and there is nothing to fear in having a human rights commission that is autonomous and sufficiently resourced to express its independence and robustly defend human rights in its commentary, laws and practices. Mrs. Mary Robinson spoke about the importance of having enough funding for a human rights commission and I ask the Minister to look at funding again. Funding for our human rights commission is less than the funding for the commission in Northern Ireland, and that has already been deemed inadequate. We should look at this again. If funding is inadequate it will limit the scope of the work the human rights commission can do.</P>
    <P>In the past some extraordinarily important cases have been pursued by individuals in Ireland seeking fundamental rights. It is telling to reflect <Col N="745" /> on those. When we look back, we see they have been solitary struggles on the part of individuals with little means, without a human rights commission. The recommendations on free legal aid that were made in relation to the incorporation of the European Convention and the need to look at free legal aid for those taking cases is very important.</P>
    <P>Think of Miss Airey and her struggle for civil legal aid and the right of access to justice for all. In the Oireachtas here Senator Norris pursued a fundamental right over long years for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. The right to marital privacy and freedom of information are the fundamental rights and freedoms which Irish individuals have sought from courts here and abroad.</P>
    <P>Yet, there are still troubling and unresolved questions such as the murder of human rights defenders like Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson, where the defenders of human rights are not free to pursue their mission and profession. When this happens the human rights of all are at risk.</P>
    <P>It is important to build a human rights culture and I agree with the views of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action in endorsing the importance of promoting and developing a human rights culture to create greater awareness of human rights and to increase the profile of human rights commissions. An institutional mechanism without popular rapport will be perceived as another moribund and faceless bureaucracy so it is important to deal with that issue. This is occurring at a time of much abstention, low voter turnout and resentment of State intervention, so the risk must be combated. I hope the Minister will consider this. It will not be easy. We are living in times of partnership, collective accommodation and compromise.</P>
    <P>A human rights culture respects the dissenting individual who goes out on a limb to pursue individual rights in public. We often treat such individuals as obsessive. We tend to stereotype them very often, which makes it difficult for them to make their case. For example, the right of young adults or individuals to a primary education is such a case &ndash; the case being pursued by Mrs. Synott. The development of a strong human rights culture teaches us, encourages us and shows us how important it is not to stereotype and to respect people who fight for rights.</P>
    <P>Some of the rights that will be explored by the new commission will be those of individuals who are otherwise outcasts. I have in mind the rights of prisoners and seriously mentally ill persons because conflict can arise in respect of their rights to freedom and rights to privacy or expression.</P>
    <P>With the crumbling of so many institutions under allegations of abuses of individual rights &ndash; from the Berlin Wall to the industrial schools of Letterfrack and Daingean &ndash; it is timely to restore the individual person to the centre of our concerns. Our response to a culture of failed <Col N="746" /> authoritarianism should be to foster a culture of respect for individual human rights. That is very important. In many institutions in this country, there are still traces of a lack of respect for individuals. As politicians we must learn about it with regard to the political system and our democracy. The need for a culture of respect must be expressed in Parliament, in the church and through education.</P>
    <P>This will be a challenge for the members of the new human rights commission. The petitions and cases presented to it may be from those who have suffered and whose lives are damaged. Suffering does not always ennoble one &ndash; it can also distort, but difficult cases of this kind will reveal our capacity to embrace the dignity of the person.</P>
    <P>There are many gaps in our legislation and services, many of which we have spoken about this year. We spoke of gaps in services for children and basic rights and accommodation for children who are getting into difficulties. We spoke of victims of violence. But there are other groups, of whom we will be more conscious in the future, such as emigrants and the Traveller community. There are many issues relating to Travellers in the equality report launched by the Minister this week. There are emerging issues concerning electronic privacy and surveillance, trafficking in persons, refugees and asylum seekers, and unaccompanied minors.</P>
    <P>I was at a conference on children's rights in Sweden recently. I had the official statistics of the Minister on unaccompanied minors. I think the number was 18. At the conference, I was told that the figure for unaccompanied minors in Ireland amounted to several hundred. Will the Minister re-examine the figures and report to me on the matter because the significant issues concerning the rights of unaccompanied minors need to be dealt with? I have no doubt but that the Minister and the health boards are doing their best to deal with the problem. However, more pressure will be put on the services if the issue is to be dealt with in the best possible way. Unaccompanied minors comprise a group that is very much at risk and in danger of having its rights violated.</P>
    <P>Other issues of concern, both national and international, relate to child prostitution and child soldiers. They too will form part of the focus of the work of the Human Rights Commission. The commission has had a difficult genesis in the constitutional world. Its appearance generated a &ldquo;hand raised to shield the eyes from an unexpected light&rdquo;. Its confinement is now over. This House will welcome studying and reading the opinions of the Human Rights Commission &ndash; be they social, cultural, political or economically based. It will welcome being informed by this offspring of a new generation of human rights thinking.</P>
    <P>Given the initial difficulties of the Human Rights Commission, two features need to be established &ndash; independence from the State &ndash; the commission should have such resources so that it is not required to be a supplicant or pet<Col N="747" /> itioner itself for their attainment &ndash; and a standing or permanent selection committee to fill <i>ad hoc</i> or occasional vacancies which may arise during its mandate so that the guarantee of pluralism is sustained. Will the Minister consider this? I tabled a motion to this effect. The taking of the approach I am advocating is in line with the Paris Principles of 1991.</P>
    <P>The amendment I tabled was ruled out of order because of the cost implications. However, it is something that should be considered. The Paris Principles on the establishment of human rights commissions emphasise that:</P>
    <P>The composition of the national institution and the appointment of its members, whether by means of an election or otherwise, shall be established in accordance with a procedure which affords all necessary guarantees to ensure the pluralist representation of the social forces (of civilian society) involved in the promotion and protection of human rights, particularly by powers which will enable effective cooperation to be established with, or through the presence of, representatives . . .</P>
    <P>The representatives in question are people or bodies that should be on a human rights commission and five examples are listed.</P>
    <P>It is very important to ensure we do this as the human rights commission grows and develops over the years. The idea should not be dismissed.</P>
    <P>One should bear in mind that the commission will not be able to review international public law that is not part of Irish law. Hence, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of discrimination Against Women &ndash; the effective international convention on women's rights &ndash; will not fall within the commission's remit. I think I am right in that regard; perhaps the Minister will comment on it.</P>
    <P>There may even be some initial confusion among the public as to what is properly the field of a human rights commission compared with the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, for example. As far as the public is concerned, there will be trial and error involved.</P>
    <P>In the past few years, we have had better mechanisms to ensure equality in this country. However, the report of the Equality Authority shows that, despite legislation pertaining to women, for example, gender inequality still tops the list of cases brought to the authority in the past year. That is telling. Judging by journalistic commentary, one would think problems concerning gender equality have been eliminated. However, there are still outstanding issues and, as the Minister acknowledged during the week, there is a need to reconsider the measures in place to tackle inequality where employment is concerned.</P>
    <P>Because of a Supreme Court ruling, it is very hard to build up proper and adequate protection with regard to disability rights. Every day we are <Col N="748" /> made aware of problems concerning wheelchair access and access to jobs. Commitments to very basic rights in respect of disability are not being met. The public may be confused about the remit of the Human Rights Commission and may require information.</P>
    <P>We live in a rights conscious world of global trade. Yet, as recently as 1995, the Council of Ministers voted to cut funding of human rights and democracy groups in half &ndash; a decision reversed by the European Parliament. Funding for human rights groups across Europe was frozen again for a period by the Commission following a UK court case &ndash; another decision contested by the European Parliament. We in the Oireachtas have an essential role in creating the conditions for the growth of grass roots democracy and advocacy, institutional mechanisms for human rights protection and good law. I welcome this amendment to the Human Rights Commission (Amendment) Bill and I look forward to the work of the Human Rights Commission in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. For once, we will not complain about the short time it will take to pass this legislation through the Dáil. I am sure the Minister appreciates the efforts of Opposition Members and members of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to have this legislation in place before the end of session. It will give us the time and space to consult in depth the many groups who welcome the European Convention on Human Rights Bill of which this legislation is an important part.</P>
      <P>It reflects well on the Minister and on the committee, to which he may sometimes feel he is dragged and held at inordinate length to discuss legislation, that we decided to deal with this separately. The European Convention on Human Rights Bill is of enormous importance and embodies the welcome European inclusiveness exemplified by the inclusion of submissions from groups.</P>
      <P>I was reminded when Deputy Fitzgerald spoke of how much we in Ireland, especially women, welcomed and have relied on European legislation, especially in the area of equality, since we became members of the then European Economic Community in 1973. That vision and welcome opening up brought on by such legislation and the sense of rights and of a centre to which we could apply if we could not get the justice we sought in Ireland is perhaps something we have lost. This may have been reflected in the rather cynical turn off and low voter turnout in the recent referendum on the Nice treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope as a result of this debate and the longer and more comprehensive debate which will take place on the European Convention on Human Rights Bill in September or October that we will be able to reinvigorate our sense of what being members of the European Union and the rights and inclusiveness of Europe mean to us. I hope we can build on that to renew for the people the <Col N="749" /> importance in the new millennium of seeing Europe as a centre and resource of rights and supports other than Structural Funds or headage payments. That is what Europe is about and it is the essence of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The legislation allows the Human Rights Commission to be established on a statutory basis with its enhanced membership of 15. Our job in that regard is twofold. One is to give it the proper resources to allow it to be independent, outgoing and accessible, especially to people who are denied full access to their rights and to the process of gaining them. The other is to ensure the work of the Human Rights Commission is in tandem with that of the Minister and of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.</P>
    <P>I would like to believe that, from its establishment, we would regularly receive reports and submissions from the commission and hold meetings with it. I note and welcome that the draft recommendations of the shadow Human Rights Commission to the committee ended on a positive note by saying that, if amendments were made to the European Convention on Human Rights Bill as it progresses through the Houses, the commission would welcome the opportunity to make further observations and recommendations. In continuing to make submissions, the commission should establish some basis for frequent consultation with the committee. Knowing the stature and competence of people on the commission, we will probably receive many reports which will exercise the committee and the Legislature in general.</P>
    <P>It is timely that we debate the establishment of the Human Rights Commission after the establishment of a similar commission in Northern Ireland. I hope there is full co-operation between both. Mr. Justice Donal Barrington said in his submission to the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that, with the establishment of Human Rights Commissions North and South under the Good Friday Agreement, both should work towards the goal of having the same rights in all parts of the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is what the Good Friday Agreement is about. If we ensure rights are safeguarded and forthcoming on both sides, perhaps we will have a resolution of the critical process being undergone again under the auspices of the Agreement. We send our best wishes to the Taoiseach in his meeting with the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. The Human Rights Commission can underpin the important structures established under the Agreement. I appeal to all sides not to cherry-pick and, instead, to accept the Agreement fully and endorse it and implement it, as I know the Human Rights Commission here will do.</P>
    <P>When we debate and, I hope, amend the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, we might include convention proofing of legislation in the same way gender proofing has been included. This is a powerful incentive to ensure <Col N="750" /> our legislation is proofed and workable when it leaves the Houses.</P>
    <P>Resources are important not just for the workings of the commission and the support it needs but also to allow it extend itself and make itself accessible to members of the public who feel they need a hearing of the commission or who need to obtain briefing or advice from or for it to take on a case on their behalf. One of the most important things we can do is allow the commission establish a proper presence. We can ensure it can do that by granting free legal aid to members of the public who wish to access the commission or other areas of law. Unfortunately, we do not grant that at present. I am confident that the Human Rights Commission by its very presence, commitment and the back-up of the European Convention on Human Rights will allow accessibility, openness and support for people who feel they have been marginalised, excluded or do not have the resources to take these cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the commission prior to the summer recess to allow it to co-operate fully with its Northern Ireland counterpart. I look forward to enacting as quickly as possible in the autumn the European Convention Bill. I do not think Members on this side of the House will delay the legislation because it is one of the most fundamental pieces of legislation which must be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a joy for me to be able to rise on legislation introduced by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which I heartily welcome. I cannot say that about many pieces of legislation since I took on this spokesmanship. I am sure that has nothing to do with the fact that it is one of the shortest Bills the Minister has introduced; it contains just two sections and four sentences. I acknowledge this in a week when really bad business is being done in this House &ndash; I genuinely say that as a parliamentarian and as someone who has respect for this House &ndash; because it is not good that fundamental legislation is guillotined through. I know Ministers and the Government Whip will say that is normal practice at the end of term. I recall each division in the Department wanting measures enacted quickly. They also discover orders that need to be dealt with which all arrive on the Minister's desk in the last few minutes. That can put huge pressure on Departments. However, we must resist turning this House into a rubber stamp. There is a tendency &ndash; I have noticed this in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in particular &ndash; to assume the Executive is the Legislature, that once the Executive passes a measure, it is a given that the House will accept it unamended. It is up to all of us to try to assert the primacy of this House and the accountability of the Executive to this House. Otherwise the whole notion is of Government backbenchers in particular and the Opposition as simply being here to make up the numbers and that the real critical mass of not just decision making but, ulti<Col N="751" /> mately, public accountability falls within the Cabinet, which is not a good thing.</P>
      <P>What is happening here is a very welcome initiative from the Minister to take a reasoned argument from this side of the House. In the backdrop of other arguments being ignored, I want to acknowledge the decision of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to split what was a single Bill and transpose into Irish law the European Convention on Human Rights and use that transposition Bill as a vehicle to regularise the situation in the Human Rights Commission by formalising the membership at 15 rather than the nine for which we have already legislated. He listened and was open and able to allow the delay to take place by allowing this particular measure to happen and the commission, which is now in shadow form, to become a reality in legislative terms. I promised umpteen times in recent weeks when I raised this issue on the Order of Business that we would facilitate a quick and early enactment. I am very pleased to carry out that pledge today.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few general points in regard to the principles that underpin the Human Rights Commission. Other Deputies said, and rightly so, that the commission will be mould breaking in terms of its functions under section (8) of the parent Act and equally the calibre of the people the Minister has appointed to that body. Its powers and reservoir of expertise have been immeasurably broadened by increasing the number from nine to 15. Some would argue that 15 is too big for a decision making body but if one considers the individual talents represented by the group of 15, it would be very difficult to find an area of thinking public life which touches on the issue of human rights that is not reflected in that grouping. It will be extraordinarily impactive and I am very impressed by the first public outing of the shadow commission, that is, the submission made by Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, currently shadow president of the Human Rights Commission, and Professor Binchy, who both made profound, balanced, clear and intelligent presentations to the committee. I look forward to many more presentations on a whole range of issues which I believe will be transforming in the way they change our attitude to the rights of individuals and, God knows, they are absolutely required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement is an extraordinarily good document which brings together a much closer functioning between Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain. Many of us in the Republic have in a very narrow fashion seen the Good Friday Agreement as a vehicle to bring about change in Northern Ireland. Equally, it will and has been a vehicle for bringing about change in the Republic. It is often very easy to identify the wrongs of another and not just not address but not even see the wrongs perpetrated by ourselves. We need to do an awful lot to get things right in our republic before we can be worthy of the name republic for which so <Col N="752" /> many generations of Irish people argued, intellectualised about and shed their blood to achieve.</P>
    <P>We will have another day to deal with the mechanism for transposition of the European Convention on Human Rights because the Minister has given us that time to listen to the authoritative voice not just of the shadow commission but also the myriad of other bodies. I am very impressed by the number of organisations throughout the country who want to have input into how the convention is transposed into domestic law. The Minister sent me a briefing on the definition of human rights to be used in the Human Rights Commission Bill on foot of amendments I tabled to the parent Bill. He also pointed out the variety of mechanisms available for taking international treaties and giving them effect in our legal framework.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up too much time today dealing with that issue but I add my voice to those who genuinely argued that the Minister should be open to persuasion in regard to the mechanism he has proposed because it is not a party political issue. If we are to make the uncomfortable decisions that will impact on us all, particularly those involved in administration at any level in the State, we must be as broad and deep as we possibly can in enshrining rights in our basic law. The Labour Party has tabled two constitutional amendments to give rights to a number of groups, particularly those who are intellectually or physically challenged, because we deny huge categories of people full participation in our democracy. This is a major issue which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am most distressed about the issue of racism and it must be addressed. One of the principal tasks of the new human rights commission will be to tackle racism in this nation. It must give it a positive focus, promote multiculturalism and break down the unfathomable prejudices that are too often manifest in the State against people of different colour. This will be one of our biggest challenges in the years ahead. Sadly, we have not done well on it to date. People have built up prejudice and allowed it to be used. Lies and misinformation have gone into public circulation in relation to asylum seekers or non-nationals that they are spongers and that they are taking houses meant for other people on housing lists. We need to take a stand on this issue and a particular burden will fall on the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lead the crusade that is required, to stand solidly against racism.</P>
    <P>We must be less understanding and tolerant of racism. I am aware of examples of it in my constituency. I vividly recall receiving a telephone call one night from a representative who attended a meeting on my behalf in my constituency. His opening words were &ldquo;Are you sitting down because I have just come from the meeting and I am still shaking?&rdquo; He said it was like a rally about which one would read or hear in the deep south in the 1960s. Many good people were there, but their fears had been whipped up. We need to deal directly now with issues of prejudice through <Col N="753" /> education, outreach services and dialogue. Ultimately, racist sentiment should not be allowed to take root. Action must be taken before it is too late and Ireland has a divisive society. I agree we all have a fundamental role to play in that regard.</P>
    <P>The functions of the commission are set out in section 8 of the parent Act. One of the matters I sought to address by way of an amendment to the parent Act when it was before the House was to broaden the definition of education in section 8(<i>d</i>). The Minister assured me at the time that there was broad scope to be proactive in second and third level education in terms of promoting multiculturalism. This will be an important job for the new commission. As I indicated, from what I have seen to date, I have great confidence that its work will be mould breaking.</P>
    <P>Ireland is changing. It is becoming more multicultural but it is also changing in the context of our view of authority. Deputy Fitzgerald referred to this aspect. There was a time, 20 or 30 years ago, when the pillars of society were the local priest, the national school teacher, the bank manager and the Garda sergeant. Their writ held and some people hanker after that time, but, as has been exposed, there was much wrong with it. Their writ was often destructive. It was a simpler time, but many people were crushed. For example, some women were held in a purdah where only certain work was acceptable for them and they could not go beyond it. Others were trapped in marriages that were oppressive and brutal.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of the House for almost 15 years and one of my most depressing moments involved a clinic case. A woman in her sixties came to me and told me that she had married and come from the west to live in my county. She said her life was wasted because she married in her late teens, was taken out of her community and came to live in a new community where she was brutalised for decades. I was the first person she had approached about the matter. She said her life was wasted and it still upsets me to think about it because I had no succour to give her. We must understand how crushing the old ways of secrecy were for so many people.</P>
    <P>Stories have emerged about institutions that were established for children. Huge pressure was placed on voluntary and religious organisations because the State did not meet its obligations. Women were trapped in unemployability while men did not realise their full potential because they did not have, and were not expected to have, access to education. Much was wrong with that society but, to some, it looks rosy in retrospect.</P>
    <P>In the new, changing Ireland, much wrongdoing is being exposed. It is like walking into the broad daylight and seeing many of our faults for the first time. It is a huge advance to recognise those faults. We will never have perfection but we can create mechanisms that strive for perfection and hold people to account. Ireland has enormous potential in that regard because there is something fundamentally good about the Irish <Col N="754" /> character. We are generous and we acknowledge the deficiencies of others. We rally to support our neighbours in times of need in a way that is not characteristic of every society.</P>
    <P>However, to achieve what is possible and build a republic to which many people would aspire, we need to tackle institutional opposition to openness. This must involve us all. The House, its Members, local authorities, institutions, State agencies and others are reluctant to open their books or themselves to accountability. This institutional opposition to the process of change needs to be addressed. The vehicle that will be formally established with the enactment of the Bill will be a critical agency in achieving that objective.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are involved in building the concept of citizenship. Every person, regardless of race, colour, disability, incapacity, sexual orientation or gender should be allowed to be full citizens of the Republic. This is an easy litany to trot out, but it is a difficult objective to realise and we have a long way to go to achieve it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to working with the new human rights commission in the months and years ahead. I agree with Deputy Barnes &ndash; I sought this on Committee Stage &ndash; that there should be another designated agency to consider legislation to ensure every enactment is in compliance with basic principles of international definitions of human rights. It would be useful if it commented on legislation before it is passed rather than afterwards. The Minister foresaw some difficulty with that suggestion, but perhaps it could be considered in the future. I welcome the Minister's openness in allowing this issue to be split from the European Convention Bill. I look forward to the detailed debate on that Bill and to the shadow disappearing from the Human Rights Commission as it becomes a statutory agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Fitzgerald, Barnes and Howlin for their contributions to this debate. In bringing legislation relating to human rights to the House, I have been very careful to consider the views of Members of the Opposition and of people outside the Oireachtas so that the legislation would reflect the broad view of Irish society. That was the intention in the composition of the original commission. It transpired, when the first nine had been appointed, that there were concerns, especially among non-governmental organisations, about the composition of the commission and we expanded the number of the commission to 15. I agree with previous speakers that the commission as it now stands is broadly reflective of Irish society and has the capacity to enhance human rights in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that everything is not all right in this jurisdiction and all wrong in Northern Ireland. This proposition is sometimes put forward because of the troubles which have afflicted Northern Ireland for so long. There are, <Col N="755" /> of course, human rights which require recognition and enforcement in this jurisdiction as much as in the other jurisdiction on this island. In this respect, the establishment of the Human Rights Commission through this legislation will shine a light into the hidden Ireland and expose an amount of wrongdoing which many people may not have expected to find. If the commission achieves this objective &ndash; and I believe it will &ndash; this will have been a good afternoon's work.</P>
    <P>If the commission is to fulfil its function adequately it must be funded properly. I secured a 25% increase in the commission's funding during last year's budgetary process, bringing the total allocation for this year to £1.25 million, which should be more than adequate for the circumstances in which we find ourselves. I will ensure that proper account is taken of the commission's needs for next year's allocations, in so far as the position can be accurately assessed.</P>
    <P>I say this arising from practical considerations because part of the difficulty in achieving a proper allocation for the commission is the blank sheet which is currently before us. Until the commission decides on its staffing complement and agrees on the formulation of its strategies, priorities and work progammes, allocations must be regarded, at best, as informed estimates of what might be required in a fully operational setting. The enactment of this Bill will clear the way for the commission to prepare and cost its plans accurately and provide the first real opportunity to address the allocation of the commission in a detailed and more informed way.</P>
    <P>I will not reiterate the arguments made on Committee Stage of the Bill last year with regard to future financing, financial autonomy for the commission, the mechanism set out in the Human Rights Commission Act for its funding and the channelling of funding through my Department. Funding mechanisms are crucially important in determining the independence of national human rights institutions. There is, however, the practical reality that States must operate within the constraints of their own budgetary and financial accounting systems &ndash; well we know it &ndash; and having consulted with the Department of Finance on this issue, it was agreed that the most straightforward and appropriate way of funding the Human Rights Commission was through a grant from my Department, the method provided for in the Act. I have no difficulty with that. I or my successor will have responsibility for many bodies and schemes which can be classed as human rights orientated.</P>

      <P>For example, the Courts Service Vote is part of my remit, as is the Equality Agency and the Director of Equality Investigations. In relation to access to justice, there is the statutory scheme for legal aid and advice. My Department also acts as the conduit for funding the criminal legal aid scheme and Victim Support.</P>
      <P>The approach taken by the House, both today in the joint committee and during the debate on the Human Rights Commission Act, has been extremely positive. That is why I am trying to ensure that we continue along that path, not just to ensure the attitude is positive all the way through but also to ensure that when the legislation setting up the commission and incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law are in place, people, irrespective of their social background or divergent views, will feel confident that the system is one in which they can have trust. That is important when one is dealing with something as fundamental as human rights. Because of the positive attitude of Deputies this afternoon and during other debates on human rights legislation, I am sure this objective will be attained.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the debate on the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. It is important that members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights hears the views of the various groups which have expressed an interest in putting foward proposals. It is equally important to realise that we cannot accommodate every person's views. The best we can do is to achieve the best compromise we can and ensure that the provisions of the Constitution are observed and not circumvented or undermined. I do not believe anyone will approach the incorporation process with the intention of doing that but I caution against excessive expectations. The Constitution has been a valuable tool in the hands of our citizens and our higher courts in moulding and fashioning human rights, whether the express rights in the Constitution itself which have been interpreted by the courts or the rights which the courts have enunciated arising out of cases taken under the Constitution. We now have a fine bill of rights. There are those who will argue that the bill of rights currently enshrined in our Constitution and in statute law, is more expansive than that contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. Other experts would not agree with that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say these things to ensure that we all know the constraints within which we must operate in terms of the method of incorporation. There is no simple solution. I take issue with the argument which has been advanced in some quarters that the approach has been more minimalist than that taken in Britain, for example. In a number of important respects the approach we have adopted in the legislation as published and before the sel<Col N="757" /> ect committee is more expansive than the British legislation on incorporation.</P>
    <P>That is for another day. Today we have made further significant progress in terms of seeing this legislation passing through Second Stage and for that I express my appreciation to the main Opposition spokespersons and to all in both Houses who have expressed an interest and contributed to the debates on human rights over the past year.</P>

      <P>My amendment to this section was not accepted. I quoted from the Paris Principles earlier about an independent selection committee. Will the Minister comment on this? The Bill could have put an independent selection committee on a statutory footing and expanded this mechanism to deal with the appointment of commission president and to deal with casual vacancies which would occur during the term of office of a commission. That was my proposal but it has been deemed to incur a charge. The idea would be to continue with the original selection process, that there would be an independent committee which would make a recommendation to a Minister. That was my thinking behind it and I would like to hear the Minister's views. In the event of vacancies arising now or in the re-appointment of the commission at a later stage, how would the Minister envisage that it would happen? Could a future Government set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee as the Minister did, to make recommendations, as opposed to putting it on a statutory footing which is clearly not now envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gender equity provisions in section 1 are welcome. I wonder if this is indicative of an approach which will be further developed in all legislation where it is relevant. It may be relevant where boards are being appointed. This type of equity provision could be built in for the representation of women. It exists in the RTE Authority Bill because I put forward an amendment to that some years ago which the Minister at the time, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, accepted. I am aware that the Minister is examining the representation of women on boards following the statistics that have been recently published and that he will make recommendations to Government. Is this an indication that there may be some <Col N="758" /> statutory footing planned for dealing with those issues, because there has been poor representation of women on boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important challenges we face in terms of human rights legislation is that we recognise and try to understand the point of view and approaches adopted by others. These may not necessarily be approaches and views that we might agree with. We must recognise that in all spheres of human existence there are differences of opinion. Opinions must be respected, irrespective of one's own opinion. This is particularly true on an issue as fundamental as human rights. It was against that background that I proposed to Government that we would set up a selection committee which would become engaged in the process of selection for members of the Human Rights Commission. The selection committee put forward names and the rest is history. It is a process which was admired internationally. The whole process was regarded as quite innovative and was seen to be at arm's length from Government.</P>
      <P>I take pride in the way the system operated. I honestly believe that even though we had subsequent additions and contributions by Government, the commission is certainly reflective of the broad spectrum of our society. Whether one would place that on a statutory footing is another matter. Deputies will appreciate that this is a matter which would require very deep consideration. I do not believe any Government irrespective of its nature, would wish to abrogate entirely its obligations in this area, the requirements of section 5, subsection (12) of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, which places the onus solely on the Government to ensure that the membership of the commission reflects the nature of Irish society in all its forms. In this connection I point out that the 1998 Northern Ireland Act and the provisions relating to the establishment of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, put similar emphasis on the need to take account of the community balance in that jurisdiction . It is a matter on which the Human Rights Commission may have a view. The Act of 2000 clearly places an onus on the commission to report within a two year period. The commission's report will have been prepared with the benefit of hindsight and the practical experience of the commission during that critical initial period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be more prudent for us to await the substantive proposals of the commission before deciding whether the independent selection committee should be placed on a statutory footing. It may well be the way forward because I have always said the Human Rights Commission is not meant to be a limb of government. It is there to interface between the public and the Government. That is the objective of the exercise. Clearly when a commission such as this is being set up, it is difficult when it is the Government which is setting up the mechanism for the appointments to ensure that one <Col N="759" /> is entirely unbiased in that respect. I honestly believe that we have probably achieved that. Deputy Fitzgerald mentions the question of gender balance. The legislation specifically provides for an equal balance in terms of gender. That was a proposal which was put forward by Deputy Howlin which I accepted in the spirit of the co-operation which we are trying to adopt in our approach to human rights in the jurisdiction and to ensure that everybody in society feels that they are included, that this is an inclusive process. As to whether that would move on to other areas of activity in terms of State boards, I do not know. I certainly wish to see a greater degree of involvement of women on boards. In terms of the fundamental issues of human rights, the fact that we have a clear statutory gender balance will contribute enormously to the inclusiveness which I am trying to ensure we attain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution. This could be something on which the Human Rights Commission would wish to address and report. The fact that we have discussed it today in the House makes it more likely that it will happen and that the Human Rights Commission may return with a view on this issue. It is important that the lessons are learned and if there are proposals for a statutory basis from the Human Rights Commission that we would have an opportunity to consider that again when the review comes in. Even though I cannot formally move the motion, I think that is the way forward. I hope the gender equity principle enshrined here will be considered by the Government in other legislation. I was not aware that it was Deputy Howlin who had moved it and I pay tribute to him for doing that. It was when Deputy Michael D. Higgins was Minister that he accepted an amendment of mine which included it in the legislation for the RTE Authority. It is good to see it but I do not think it has been used too often in between times.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I can give the reasons. I appreciate it is unusual to move that a Bill, as a whole, be recommitted to Committee Stage. I would like to give my reasons.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is opposed to the Bill as a whole and intends to vote against it. Report Stage is guillotined and is due to finish at 6 p.m. That means, at most, we have two and a half hours of debate for the Bill. Realistically, and because there are substantial issues contained in amendments tabled for Report Stage, we will not get to complete all the amendments listed for Report Stage. In my view we will not be able to debate or vote on those amendments. I expect a number of the amendments will require a division.</P>
      <P>This morning the Government circulated a new amendment dealing with the prohibition of opinion polls in the last week of an election campaign. That amendment is to page 94 of the Bill. Given the guillotine on the debate, that amendment will not be reached. That means that at the end of the debate at 6 p.m. the question that will be put on the amendment, which I understand is a Government amendment, will be to accept the Bill and any of the Government amendments thereto. If the amendment is put at that stage and in that form it will automatically become part of the Bill without having been debated and discussed on Report Stage. There are matters in the Government amendment which amount to almost a new Bill. There are new definitions proposed which should properly be considered as part of the definitions section. There is the substantive issue in relation to the prohibition of opinion polls in the seven days prior to an election. I expressed my own views on that issue on Committee Stage last week. There are proposals for new offences which have not been considered on Committee Stage which involve fines of up to £100,000 or imprisonment for up to two years. Effectively, this is proposing the possible imprisonment of, for example, newspaper editors for a period of two years.</P>
      <P>Whatever views we may have on the issue of the banning of opinion polls a week before an election, it is not appropriate that the Legislature should seek to make law in an area such as this without considered discussion. The only way to get considered discussion of this matter is by referring the entire Bill back to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The issues that have to be considered are wider now, as a result of the Government amendment, than the issue of the prohibition on opinion polls. I do not propose to go into the detail but I give this as an example of the kind of issue that I think the House would want to consider. As defined in the Government amendment, &ldquo;Opinion poll&rdquo; means:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>. . . a systematic inquiry conducted by means of questioning a sample of persons considered <Col N="761" /> to be representative of the population of the State or any part thereof for the purpose of ascertaining the likely opinions of the population of the State as a whole or part thereof on matters relating to an election or referendum etc.</P>
    <P>That would mean a canvasser at election time marking an electoral register and asking voters how they intended to vote would be guilty of an offence under this proposal.</P>
    <P>The reason I propose that the Bill be recommitted is that this entire issue requires greater consideration and debate. Issues arise from the Government's amendment, which we got only this morning and I have had only an initial opinion on it, which are wider than the issue relating to opinion polls as discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I propose that the entire Bill be recommitted to Committee Stage so that Members can have a proper debate on the issue and that parties outside the House can have an opportunity to contribute to that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the arguments being made and I reject the proposal for recommittal. The &ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo; amendment was raised on Committee Stage and a good discussion took place. The amendment was tabled by Deputy Mitchell. Deputy Gilmore contributed to the discussion and indicated his clear support for the intent of <Col N="762" /> the amendment. I indicated that the Government side was prepared to accept the intent of the amendment but that it would need to be structured in such a way as to meet the requirements of the Parliamentary Counsel and good law to ensure that what was proposed could be implemented. That is the normal standard procedure. There was a firm commitment to bring forward an amendment on the part of the Government at the behest of the Opposition. The official amendment is grouped with amendment No. 15 so that the matter can be reached today. With regard to the grouping, we can discuss only the Report Stage amendments. As is normal, amendments relating to similar matters are grouped where that is deemed appropriate. In this case, the sixth group contains amendment Nos. 15 and 34 (a), one of which is Deputy Mitchell's amendment and the other is a Government amendment. There is no reason we cannot reach the sixth group of amendments by 6 p.m. even taking account of Question Time. There is ample time for discussion. I cannot agree that there is any argument, under the rules of this House, for a recommital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The core policy goal of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to the Irish language is to reverse the decline in the use of the language as the principal means of communication in the Gaeltacht and to extend its use in the rest of the country. A supporting objective of that policy goal is to encourage the expansion of the use of Irish and the delivery of State services through Irish on a countrywide basis.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government, on 12 June, approved the general scheme of the official languages equality Bill. The general scheme has been forwarded to the Attorney General's office so that the Bill may be drafted with a view to publication in the autumn. This is a major policy initiative on specifying the language rights of citizens and improving the delivery of State services through Irish to those seeking such a service.</P>
      <P>Another significant policy proposal relating to the Irish language which the Government approved resulted in the establishment of An Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht last year. The commission was established to make recommendations with regard to the strengthening of the Irish language as the everyday language of the people of the Gaeltacht. Its report is expected to be available before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the former Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Ó Cuív, established Coiste Comhairleach na nÓg to provide a young person's perspective on the needs of the Gaeltacht. While this initiative did not require Government approval, I consider it worthwhile to refer to it. The committee, which was representative of all Gaeltacht areas, was specifically asked to consider the linguistic needs of the Gaeltacht and how the acquisition of Irish among young people could be improved, Irish language media, education, participation by young people in work and public life, how people can be encouraged to remain in the Gaeltacht and how the State can most effectively assist Irish language organisations. The report of this committee, which was officially launched recently, will be a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate about the future of the Irish language in general and of the Gaeltacht in particular. I shall pay specific attention to the recommendations contained therein as shall, I expect, An Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Another major policy development in relation to the Irish language which took place during this Government's period of office was the establishment of Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language agency of the North-South language body. The establishment of this agency opens up new and exciting possibilities for the promotion of Irish on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to ongoing and strategic support for the Irish language was demonstrated shortly after coming to office by the establishment, on the initiative of the then Minister of State at the Department, of the interdepartmental committee on the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language. Its terms of reference were to co-ordinate the implementation of Government policy with regard to the offshore islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, to seek to ensure that this policy is implemented in an effective manner and to review the provision of services to offshore islands and Gaeltacht regions by Departments and State agencies and, where duplication occurs, to rationalise these services by consultation and agreement. This committee has and will continue to operate for the benefit of the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. However, my question was directed at the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, who has Cabinet responsibility for the promotion of the language. The Minister of State mentioned the publication of the language Bill, which will clearly not be ready in this session. Will the Minister guarantee that it will come before the House in the next term? The Minister of State also mentioned Foras na Gaeilge, the cross-Border language co-operation body under the Good Friday Agreement. If the Agreement is suspended, as appears very possible, will Foras na Gaeilge continue to operate or will it, too, be suspended?</P>
      <P>Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht has been operating for a year. When will its report be furnished to the Department and the House?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope and expect that the language Bill will be ready by the beginning of the next session. As I indicated earlier, I hope to have it published by the autumn. The Minister and myself both anticipate that all sides of the House will facilitate taking this legislation during the next term. The work of Foras na Gaeilge, the North-South language body, will continue as will the implementation of policy. It is for both Governments to decide if the body's work will cease. The Taoiseach has indicated that the North-South bodies will continue their work in the interim until such time as decisions are made. We continue our work as normal despite the current impasse in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>RTE lodged a formal outline application with me on 5 October 2000 for an increase of £50 in the television licence fee. On 31 October 2000 RTE lodged detailed documentation in support of the application. My Department engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to advise on the application. The consultants' report was received in late January 2001. That report identified a number of significant issues of concern arising from the consultants' examination of the RTE application which were not resolved by the further information supplied to the consultants. These issues were of sufficient significance as to preclude any submission by me to Government in the absence of additional information and clarification from RTE.</P>
      <P>Following a number of meetings with the chairman of the authority, arising from the findings in the consultants report, at my request PricewaterhouseCoopers met the chairman and senior management of RTE to set out the type of information that RTE would need to provide in the form of an additional submission in order to address the issues identified by the consultants. Additional information supplied by RTE in support of its application for an increase in the level of television licence fee was received in my Department on 20 April 2001 and was examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Its report on the additional information was received by my Department on 5 June 2001. I have today made arrangements for copies of both reports to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the reports I formed the view I had no option but to adopt a phased approach to the question of a licence fee increase. On 3 July 2001 the Government reached a decision on the application. Based on my recommendations, the Government agreed to an increase of £14.50 in the television licence fee to take effect from 1 September 2001 bringing the colour television <Col N="767" /> licence fee to £84.50 (107) and the monochrome licence to £68.50 (84), and to consider a further increase in the television licence fee from 1 April 2003, subject to prior independent verification that certain conditions have been met.</P>
    <P>The intention behind this decision is to enable RTE to continue to provide the existing level of service while maintaining reasonable cash reserves. A very significant proportion of the additional revenue which a £50 increase would generate was proposed by RTE to be spent on improving the level of output and quality of indigenous programming. The Government could not agree to this element of the application because the RTE supporting argument was found to be less than convincing.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that public service broadcasting must be supported and strengthened. However, Government has to be assured that RTE has prepared itself both in its organisation and thinking for the new broadcasting era. Technological developments will allow for the establishment of many extra broadcasters who will compete for the attention of Irish viewers and listeners. Therefore, there must be confidence that additional public moneys provided to RTE through the licence fee will be efficiently spent on improving the quality of services rather than maintaining existing cost bases. Structures must be put in place to ensure that RTE's performance in delivering on its statutory remit is transparent and effective. The Government has deferred further consideration of this element of the RTE application in order to allow it the opportunity to provide such reassurances.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Government also found the case made by RTE to introduce new digital channels to be less than convincing. The Government believes that, as the national public service broadcaster, RTE has a vital role to play in the roll out of such services. The Government wants to see more convincing plans from RTE regarding the introduction of digital channels.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving in due course its robust submission that will enable the Government to address with confidence RTE's financial requirements. I am satisfied that the Government decision in its entirety represents a satisfactory approach that will seek to ensure the financial viability of RTE in the long-term and render it more accountable without creating unwieldy bureaucratic structures.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister ensure Opposition spokespersons are provided with copies of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report? Will she assure the House that what appears to be leaked material, which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent </i>this morning, was not leaked by her or anybody acting on her behalf? Does the Minister agree that the policy adopted by her effectively means RTE will never be able to get into the area of digital terrestrial television in an effective way? <Col N="768" /> Does she agree that competing transmission platforms are absorbing market share and that the critical mass necessary for the RTE project to be viable will not be around in 18 months time and that by deferring any further decision until her Government is long gone out of office, she is, in effect, copping out and leaving RTE in a very bad state financially and without the resources to move forward? The Minister spoke about an independent survey to determine what, if any, organisational changes and resources are needed by RTE in the discharge of its mandate. Will she give the House a categorical assurance that this in no way alludes to editorial policy? What exactly does this mean?</P>

      <P>Copies of the report are being made available to the Library this afternoon. The Deputy will have access to them. If he requires a copy, I can get a copy for him. In regard to any leaks, I only had time to read one newspaper this morning and I did not see any leaks but if there are, they are certainly not my doing.</P>
      <P>In regard to RTE's digital terrestrial proposals, this is particularly important as we in the Houses of the Oireachtas know having discussed the first broadcasting legislation in 11 years. It referred to the structure of digitalisation and those structures are running to time. What we are referring to here in terms of the digital channels is something far more specific. These proposals were made in the RTE submission looking for funding to be able to progress with digital channels. On independent evaluation of RTE's proposals, it was found by PWC that no strategic approach was available from RTE on that. Far greater detail would be needed before any consideration could be given to funding. I would encourage RTE to come to me as quickly as possible. Perhaps by the end of the year we might be able to see a strategy being put in place with regard to the proposals RTE might have on digitalisation. If so, I would be extremely interested to see those proposals because it is most important that we move forward with new technologies and use them to best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the licence fee and deferring this decision, this is an interim increase of £14.50. The figure of £14.50 was arrived at in a scientific way based on the application made by RTE which was independently evaluated by PWC. The £14.50 is to cover and ensure the maintenance of existing services and ensure there is not an elimination of cash reserves. The decision of Cabinet was that a number of other issues have to be addressed with regard to the programming, digitalisation and completion of the transformation programme. When these criteria are met, RTE will then have an opportunity to come back to look for a further increase. While I have specific responsibility where broadcasting is concerned, I am also dealing with public moneys which have to be accounted for in a very strategic way and that is why it is most important that a strong case is <Col N="769" /> made and that we can stand over figures, as we can with the £14.50 in this case.</P>
    <P>In regard to editorial policy, I do not think any Government would wish to interfere in editorial policy. That is not the intention of this Government. We want to ensure there are resources in place and that there is an opportunity in organisational terms for the authority itself, as opposed to the executive, to carry out its statutory functions. That is why it would be very useful to have an independent look at this. I am sure there would not be any problems with that and that this would be welcomed by any organisation. We might find that there is no need for further resources or a further look at the organisational position. That is up to the independent study that will take place.</P>

      <P>I would be very disappointed in view of what has happened this week if I did not have the opportunity to ask at least one supplementary question. Obviously, the PWC report was of critical importance for the Minister and the Government in deciding what to do with RTE. The purported conclusions in this morning's newspaper suggested PWC, a highly regarded and eminent firm, has produced a flawed, inadequate and short sighted report based on little or no public and industrial consultation and ignored the digital challenges facing Irish broadcasting of which RTE is at the heart. Will the Minister admit that PWC is no more than a fig leaf of respectability to conceal her own decision to starve RTE into silence? The report is being given to the House this afternoon but, more importantly, will the Minister publish the brief she gave PWC so as least we can find out what her instructions were?</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister met the chairman of the authority yesterday. Did the chairman tender his resignation and those of the authority in response to the manifest and public display of zero confidence the Minister has shown in the chairman and the authority which she appointed? Does the Minister believe it will be possible for the chairman and the authority to regain or reaffirm the confidence not only of the public but of their own employees in RTE who are in a state of chaos at the moment? I understand it is like being at a wake out there. They just do not know what is around the corner or what is their future as employees of that organisation.</P>

      <P>Formal meetings of the Council of the European Union for Culture and Audio-visual Affairs are held every six months, unusually in May-June and November-December at the end of the term of each Presidency. Ten formal meetings of the EU Council of Ministers have been held since June 1997. Of these, I attended meetings on 24 November 1997, 17 November 1998, 23 November 2000 and 21 June 2001.</P>
      <P>Critical decisions in regard to culture and audio-visual matters were taken at these meetings. For example, the main political debate on the single framework for culture &ndash; Culture 2000 &ndash; and the decision on the European capital of culture event for the period 2005 to 2019 took place at the Council meeting of 17 November 1998. The most important decision concerning the European audio-visual industry, namely the adoption of the MEDIA PLUS programme, was taken at the meeting of 23 November 2000 and I was involved in the political discussion around this proposal. At the meeting of 21 June 2001, the most important issue from my perspective was the Commission announcement of its intention to explore certain legal aspects in regard to the audio-visual industry. I participated in the discussion following the Commission announcement and my views were echoed by other member states. I was represented at all other formal meetings by Ireland's deputy permanent representative to the European Union.</P>
      <P>Informal meetings of Ministers are hosted by the member state which holds the EU Presidency. Such meetings provide the opportunity for political debate on various issues identified by the Presidency as being of particular importance. Decisions are not taken at informal Council meetings of which there have been seven. I attended meetings on 11 and 12 September 1998, 18-20 July 1999, 20-22 July 2000 and 21 and 22 May 2001. I was represented at the other meetings by senior Department officials.</P>

The MEDIA PLUS programme to which the Deputy specifically refers is a very important issue and the decision <Col N="772" /> thereon was taken on 23 November 2000. Not only was I at that meeting, I was very happy to lead the discussions. I have reason to believe it was the Irish proposal advanced on that occasion which won the support of my EU colleagues.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature which demonstrated that of 14 European nations, Ireland ranked lowest in its implementation of the Habitats Directive; her views on whether this report supports the five Irish NGOs which in 2000 produced a special area of conservation shadow list which included 648 sites compared to her 365 sites; and if she will now reconsider her position that Ireland had provided a sufficient list of sites to satisfy its obligations under the Habitats Directive.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the report to which the Deputy refers nor am I aware of the criteria used or the identity of the assessors. I consider Ireland is implementing the Habitats Directive in an effective manner. Delays in sending proposals to the European Commission arose mainly from Ireland's insistence on engaging in full consultation with affected parties before formally proposing candidate sites. This process of consultation means that landowners will have greater appreciation and acceptance of the needs of conservation and this will result in Ireland's implementation of the directive being more effective in the long-term.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Natura 2000 Barometer, published by the European Commission, which is used to allocate placings to member states taking account of the extent to which they have met the requirements of the Habitats Directive and Birds Directive, ranks Ireland in seventh place out of the 15 member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the directive was transposed into Irish law in February 1997 by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. A total of 362 sites, covering almost 1,000,000 hectares of land and water have to date been formally transmitted to the Commission. These sites are fully protected under national legislation. These proposals will be assessed in the light of currently available scientific information at the Atlantic Region Biogeographical Seminar scheduled for September 2001. Having regard to the number and extent of candidate SACs now proposed, I anticipate that Ireland's proposals will be deemed sufficient for most habitats and species. If deficiencies are identified for a small number of habitats <Col N="773" /> or species, further decisions will be taken in the light of the conclusions of the seminar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister correctly that she has not seen this report which has been on the Internet since its publication last week? If so, what does this say about her interest in the wildlife conservation? The Minister referred to an EU report. Does she agree that the scope of that report was quite limited in that it focused on a specific number of sites rather than considering the totality of conservation in the countries in question? Does the Minister further agree it is extremely worrying that in regard to planning permissions sought in SAC areas, Dúchas is on record as only commenting on 24% of these and only objecting to 8%? This would seem to indicate a very lackadaisical and inadequate response from the Department to conservation needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not formally received any report in this area and, unlike some Members, I do not intend to comment on a report I have not seen. The Natura 2000 Barometer which is compiled in an independent fashion is published by the European Commission and is obviously of worth as it would, otherwise, be pointless. Each member state has regard to the barometer and Ireland ranked seventh out of 15 member states.</P>
      <P>Following the Atlantic Regional Biogeographical Seminar, there will be a further opportunity to consider the issue of SACs if that is deemed necessary. Although Dúchas has a role in regard to planning, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has primary responsibility for planning matters.</P>

Will the Minister ensure that the specific management plans for the Natura 2000 network which were supposed to have been completed by March 1999 are completed without delay? To date she has relied on European life funding. Will she ensure Government resources, which have been badly lacking, are put into the work of conservation?</P>

Having regard to the NGOs shadow list which includes up to 600 plus sites, the Mnister should balance the situation countrywide rather than have a concentration of these sites on the Western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that two different views have been expressed. Some Deputies want far greater land to be included under candidate SACs while others are disturbed that they would seem to be concentrated only in some areas. As Deputy Burke will understand, the designation of SACs is done purely on a scientific basis. It is not a question of east <i>versus</i> west or north <i>versus</i> south. It depends on the whereabouts of the habitats that need particular protection. Some counties have more SACs than others, but that has happened because of scientific assessment.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Sargent will accept there are certain procedures for getting and assessing information and that they would not necessarily be followed if one was to spend time searching the Internet, although a great deal of information is to be found there. I have not seen the report because it would not have been formally given to me. It is important that particular procedures are followed to ensure there is order and strategy to approaching these issues.</P>

      <P>It is not clear from the Deputy's question whether he is referring to the Wicklow Mountains National Park Council or the Wicklow Uplands Council, which are separate entities. I propose, therefore, to give a brief description of both groups.</P>
      <P>The Wicklow Mountains National Park Council was established by me because I was keen to obtain the considered views of the local communities and groups which have a legitimate interest in the national park. The Park Council will work with Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, in finalising the management plan for the Wicklow Mountains National Park, in the eventual implementation of this plan and in considering general issues relating to the park. Dúchas will continue to have responsibility for the management of the park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the park council has recently received from me a copy of the draft management plan for the Wicklow Mountains National Park for its consideration. No funds are provided to the council, but it is supported by my Department in its deliber<Col N="775" /> ations by the provision of meeting facilities and a secretarial back-up.</P>
    <P>The Wicklow Uplands Council is an independent body representing 28 non-statutory groups and individuals. This council is concerned with issues broader than the national park, whereas the interests of the Wicklow Mountains National Park Council mainly lie within the boundaries of the national park. I have, however, agreed that the regional manager of Dúchas will attend meetings of the council in the capacity of observer, if requested.</P>
    <P>I understand that The Heritage Council, Wicklow County Council and FÁS provide the main funds for the Wicklow Uplands Council. My Department does not provide funds to the Wicklow Uplands Council.</P>

Does she foresee a situation where this council might receive funding from her Department and does she consider it would be beneficial if it did? She outlined the number of bodies, I think she said 23, represented on the council. Does she agree that it might be necessary to provide funding to the Wicklow Mountains National Park Council in its own right in addition to the services provided by her Department which she outlined?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned his primary interest is in the Wicklow Mountains National Park Council. That council deals specifically with the management of the park. I was delighted to set it up because I wanted to give local people an opportunity to have a direct input into the management of their national park, an amenity of which they are very proud.</P>
      <P>The management plan represents a considered view of the management of my Department on the future role of the national park and the proposed objectives for its management. Members of the park council will review the proposals therein and will work with Dúchas on finalising the management plans. This is very much a collaborative effort.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the back-up forthcoming from my Department. I explained that no funds are provided to the council by my Department, but it provides meeting facilities and a secretarial back-up because I recognise that a group such as this would need that assistance directly from my Department. I have willingly ensured that it is available to the group.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the consideration which is being given by her Depart ment to a proposal to relocate the National Concert Hall to a new site on Infirmary Road; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In 1981 the National Concert Hall was built within the Earlsfort Terrace complex to fill a major gap in the cultural infrastructure of the city as a venue suitable for classical musical performance. The Concert Hall shares its accommodation with UCD and it was recognised from the outset that the overall space allocated to it and the backstage accommodation, in its broadest interpretation, was fairly confined.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment the NCH has developed as a venue for many forms of musical performance and has to meet increasingly stringent health and safety regulations and requirements. The inadequacies inherent in the original location are now a serious constraint on its operations. In addition, it most notably lacks a self-contained auditorium for musical performances of a more intimate character.</P>
      <P>Accordingly I, together with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, authorised the Secretaries General of the Departments of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and Education and Science, together with the Chairman of the Office of Public Works to form a high level group to examine and report on all the issues involved in relation to the NCH at Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the high level group is currently considering the draft of its report to Ministers and that the option of the relocation of the National Concert Hall to a State owned site at Infirmary Road and Conyngham Road is one of a number of possibilities being considered. I anticipate that the group will soon submit its final report and recommendations to me and to the Minister for Education and Science for consideration, following which proposals requiring further action will be brought to Government for decision.</P>

      <P>The National Concert Hall has been a successful national institution. I am sure all of us would like to share in its success because it has been an excellent example of the work it does. The National Concert Hall does not have the further backstage facilities and second auditorium it requires and it is difficult to envisage how those facilities could be accommodated on the existing site. In light of those concerns, we set up the expert group to examine not only one particular site but possible alternative sites. The expert group will report to me on the suitability of the site at Infirmary Road. We will have to <Col N="777" /> consider whether that site would be sufficient for the expansion of the facilities to include a second auditorium and on-stage facilities, but all of this is very much in the melting pot. I am looking forward to the expert group coming back to me and I will keep the House informed. I am sure more questions will be asked on this.</P>

      <P>Where does this study leave the proposed development of the real tennis court, which was to be incorporated into the National Concert Hall at Earlsfort Terrace? What is the situation with the real tennis court? Does she agree that whether the hall is relocated or not the real tennis court should be preserved for the use for which it was originally intended? The agreement made when Earlsfort Terrace was handed over to the State and the Minister's late grandfather in 1939 should be upheld and the commitment made to Lord Iveagh should be maintained. The court should be used for real tennis.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that the present National Concert Hall has memories for many of us from when we sat examinations while attending UCD. Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle himself spent some time there. Apart from that, can the Minister give us the time scale involved in the possible relocation of the National Concert Hall?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with Deputy O'Shea's question, as we said the question of costings has not yet been worked out regarding a new site. We must see what sites may be available and what kinds of facilities could be accommodated at those sites. It is all very well for some of us to identify sites as being wonderful for a concert hall but we must know the actual parameters, which can only be done by experts such as engineers and architects. That kind of information will be given to us. The existing situation causes difficulty for the general running of the National Concert Hall because obviously a second auditorium is needed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the real tennis court, the building which incorporates that has run into some planning turbulence and obviously we must wait to see what arises out of that procedure; it is obviously independent of any of us and it would be inappropriate for me to comment other than to say that I have made my views on this issue known here before. That is the situation regarding that building: there are planning difficulties which have to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is already familiar with the problems besetting stone monuments and is conversant with the issues raised in the Heritage Council report. No formal meetings have taken place between the Heritage Council and my Department for the specific purpose of discussing this report but I would expect that the topic would be aired when my officials next meet with representatives of the council.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may be aware that I have previously stated that the report needs to be put in context. For example, stone monuments are, by their nature, largely ruinous and, in most cases, have been in decay for many hundreds of years; this is an inherited problem and even with best conservation practice, which is slow and painstaking by its nature, the problems will not be remedied overnight; the rate of decay relates to the type of stone used in the construction so that, for example, soft sandstone monuments are more affected than limestone monuments and this is particularly true in the case of the finer carved detailing on many of the sites assessed in the report; intensive damage is often caused by higher vegetal species such as ivy and trees but the remedy does not require costly specialist interventions; and finally, the report assesses only 112 monuments but there are over 120,000 monuments in the State of which 740 are in State care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that in November last year I announced a major investment of over £100 million in the built heritage under the national development plan which included an unprecedented level of commitment to the conservation of national monuments in the care of the State. Given the above context I emphasise that the State, through Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has been to the fore in stone conservation practice in caring for the 740 monuments in State ownership. I have also supplemented this direct investment with a new apprenticeship programme. This will widen the skills base available in my Department and help to ensure that there is a continuation of the skills <Col N="779" /> necessary to carrying out a successful conservation programme.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased to be able to provide an additional £500,000 to the Heritage Council in this year's Revised Estimates, thereby enabling the council to allocate £1.25 million in 2001 to its buildings at risk programme.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to extend public ownership of monuments. In 1999, the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, or NIAH, was formally established in my Department following the enactment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. The aim of the NIAH is to identify, record and evaluate the architecture of Ireland in a systematic and uniform manner.</P>
    <P>It has always been my position that successful protection of the built heritage cannot be achieved through the State services alone. While much has been done in recent years with the introduction of new measures to protect our buildings of value, through a scheme of grants and provision of expertise at local authority level, it is up to everyone &ndash; the State, property owners, developers and the experts &ndash; to play their part.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by what I see in the private sector when it comes to conservation and in this particular instance, stone conservation. There is now a proliferation of specialist firms and individuals operating in this area with the result that the fabric of many of our fine buildings, including the likes of churches and Georgian buildings, are being conserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in light of her answer to a similar question on 29 May this year she was anticipating that her officials would be making arrangements to meet with representatives of the Heritage Council but that that meeting has not yet taken place and no date has been set for it? Is she not aware that the chief executive of the Heritage Council has stated that it was vital that the situation be remedied as quickly as possible? He further stated that for far too long we have ignored the problem to the detriment of our dolmens, stone crosses, churches and castles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I am sure this issue will be discussed by my officials and representatives of the Heritage Council at their next meeting. To put this in perspective regarding the findings of that report, I agree that that report needs to be discussed with the Heritage Council because, for example, the council indicated that Baltinglass Abbey was one of the most damaged monuments but this view is not shared by my own experts. The issues need to be discussed in more detail and I am sure that will be done before too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister inform the House if a comprehensive archaeological survey of the country on a county by county basis has <Col N="780" /> yet been completed? I know Donegal's was completed ten or 15 years ago but what is the situation nationally? How many counties have yet to complete such a survey in order to give us a real and accurate picture of the situation on the ground regarding this important part of our national heritage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy remembers our discussions on the establishment of the NIAH. It was important to get this under way because without the legislation that now exists it would have taken no less than 40 years to complete the survey. Under the NIAH that will be completed within 12 years. Regarding the county surveys, when discussing that in the House previously I have said that it is hoped that the county surveys are complete within two to three years. Obviously the counties issue is a separate question but I can get the information for the Deputy. I see where he is coming from and the county surveys are obviously being given priority to ensure that that particular work is done as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the report from the Heritage Council has caused much concern among various communities? It appears that Dúchas and the Heritage Council are in conflict on this issue. I seek an assurance from the Minister that Dúchas will carry out and publish its own report rather than disagreeing with the Heritage Council. She mentioned Baltinglass Abbey, Blackcastle in Wicklow, the crystals well in Greystones and other sites mentioned in the report. Will Deputy de Valera get Dúchas to carry out and publish a professional report on those to reassure the public. It is not totally satisfactory to be told that Dúchas disagrees with the Heritage Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that most local authorities have appointed heritage officers, has the Minister issued guidelines so that a co-ordinated listing and national inventory of heritage sites are produced to ensure different local authorities do not emphasise different aspects of buildings. Currently, there is too much emphasis on buildings in urban areas, which may not have very much importance in terms of heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the approach of her Department is quite lethargic when one considers that the survey found that one in five of the monuments is affected by intensive stone decay and that one in ten shows such structural damage as to be in danger of collapse? What action is being taken with regard to the difficulties highlighted in the report regarding the frieze carvings at Ardmore Cathedral in County Waterford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ulick Burke in terms of the movement of the heritage offices to the county councils. It will be a tremen<Col N="781" /> dous boon in that they will be able to focus on issues relevant to them. It will be of great benefit to the local authorities and the people in the regions in which they administer.</P>
      <P>With regard to a co-ordinated listing, the local authorities have a specific responsibility of listing buildings of local interest. Sometimes, that responsibility is confused by some individuals with the responsibilities I have at a national level. The local authorities have very specific responsibilities and they are uniform.</P>
      <P>It must be the first time a politician has been accused of causing weathering. I cannot be responsible for how certain stone monuments become ruinous because of the materials used in their building. As I pointed out, stone monuments are, by there nature, largely ruinous and, in most cases, they have been in a state of decay for many hundreds of years. The time it takes for buildings to suffer from erosion depends on the type of material with which they were built. This must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>In the light of the report, the first thing that should be done is to have a discussion with the Heritage Council. There is possibly a difference of opinion between two bodies of experts &ndash; those in the Heritage Council and those in my Department. I would be putting it too strongly to suggest there is conflict. It would be wise to await the outcome of that discussion before pre-empting how either side will react to the issue.</P>

      <P>There has been an extensive level of consultation in the context of my review of the existing arts legislation. In July 2000, I published a discussion document &ldquo;Towards a New Framework for the Arts&rdquo;, which set out in broad terms many of the issues to be addressed concerning the arts. I invited the arts sector to respond to this document and more than 230 submissions were received.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a consultation seminar was held in May this year, during which more than 30 key players in the arts sector were brought together in focus groups to consider in detail the issues arising regarding the legislative review, which had been brought to the fore in the submissions received. The outcome of their discussions were presented to and discussed at a plenary session, to which were invited all the 230 parties who had made submissions. Other interested individuals and organisations were also invited to this plenary session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The views and outcomes that have emerged from this consultation process have informed my proposals, which have been approved by Govern<Col N="782" /> ment for the drafting of a new Arts Bill.

An bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta gur leor é sin nó ar mhaith léi go mbeadh méadú níos mó ar fhostaíocht sna Gaeltachtaí ná mar atá déanta go dtí seo? Tá deacrachtaí móra sna Gaeltachtaí ar fad maidir le fostaíocht, ó Thír Chonaill go Corcaigh go Ciarraí. Cad iad na pleananna atá ag an Údarás chun níos mó fostaíochta a chur ar bun i mbliana? Bheithfeá ag súil, leis an airgead uilig a chaitear agus a cuireadh ar fáil don údarás, go mbeadh deis aige níos mó postanna a chur ar fáil ná 68.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to my reply to Questions Nos. 342 and 343 of the 26 June 2001. I confirm that, in accordance with the undertaking given by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, at the meeting in Tullamore on 24 June 1999, if amounts due to landowners under the proposed Dúchas scheme for losses arising to farmers from the conservation prescriptions on the Shannon callows are greater than amounts received by the same landowners under the Birdwatch Ireland corncrake scheme, the differences will be paid retrospectively. This is an exceptional measure in recognition of the conservation benefits of farmers' participation in the corncrake scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúchas, in association with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, funds the voluntary corncrake grant scheme which is administered by Birdwatch Ireland. Grants are paid to farmers whose meadows fall within a 250 metre radius of a singing male, with the male recorded on at least two occasions a minimum of one week apart. Payments are on a per hectare basis for delayed mowing until 1 August, 15 August or 1 September and for centre-out mowing. Birdwatch Ireland is responsible for the implementation of <Col N="786" /> the scheme. Funding of the scheme by my Department will amount to approximately £46,000 this year. Farmers entering the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, are not eligible for payment under the corncrake grant scheme and, as the numbers of landowners entering REPS increases, the costs of the grant scheme will reduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply and for the indication for the first time of the amount of grants available. Does she accept the consultation process which was supposed to have been entered into as a follow-up to the meeting on 24 June 1999 did not take place? Does she also accept that many participating farmers have been seriously aggrieved by the indication that they were responsible for withdrawing access to their farms to personnel from Dúchas and by the manner in which officials came on site unannounced? I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated the amount of the grant being made available. However, Dúchas fails to recognise the change in farming practices as a result of farmers' total and voluntary commitment to this scheme. It is a pity there is not greater consultation and rapport between all the parties involved. There is a lot of despondency among the farming community at the way they have been treated by the Department and Dúchas in particular, and the fact that their co-operation was forthcoming has not been fully acknowledged by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that the corncrake grant scheme is a voluntary one. I always believe in consultation. I wished to attend the meeting to try to find a resolution to this issue, which has taken some time. The Deputy alluded to landowners and the access issue which may have caused some of the delays. However, the matter is now nearing a satisfactory resolution. The measure I have outlined is exceptional in that it recognises the conservation benefits of farmers' participation in the corncrake scheme. It also recognises the tremendous voluntary effort and importance of the voluntary scheme which could not take place without the co-operation of the landowners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The corncrake is an annex 1 species of the EU Birds Directive which is Ireland's only globally threatened bird species. Obviously there is a need to immediately address this issue. In order to do so the corncrake grant scheme was set up in the early 1990s by the then National Parks and Wildlife and Birdwatch Ireland on the Shannon callows. A number of <Col N="787" /> measures are being developed to further the corncrake conservation plan and Dúchas in 2001 commenced funding a three year research programme in the Shannon callows to investigate habitat use and late season requirements for cover. The Department recognises that further research and development need to be carried out and it is working on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The continuing bone of contention among farmers relates to the inadequacy of the grant in recognising the actual area of land farmed as against the Minister's criteria in listing the out meadows. Many people who are dedicated to this conservation effort and wish to adhere to the requirements of the scheme are being denied adequate compensation in that the actual area farmed is quite different from the meadow areas that must be mown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's figures this week in regard to the corncrake population in which there has been an alarming decline over a number of years. What percentage of the national flock is in the Shannon callows as distinct from other parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would need to table a specific question on that matter because my information is more general. I will try to be helpful and give him the information available to me.</P>
      <P>The 1988 national census revealed approximately 930 calling birds throughout the country. Between then and 1993, the decline continued and only 173 calling birds were recorded in the latter year. Since 1993 Dúchas has funded the corncrake grant scheme on an annual basis. This has concentrated on delayed mowing, centre-out mowing and the provision of early cover. The rate of decline has slowed down but the species is still at a dangerously low level, which is an important issue. It is the only bird species occurring in Ireland which is classified as globally threatened. My Department is funding the scheme to the tune of £46,000 per annum. The issue which is being addressed is of concern to the experts within my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently received representations from the world and national bodies representing advertisers. Both sets of representations, which are essentially the same, argue strongly against the notion of introducing formal restrictions on television advertising directed at <Col N="788" /> children. Both were received close to the informal Council of Ministers meeting organised by the Swedish Presidency last May. The Swedish Presidency introduced this topic on the agenda by way of a note that asked three questions as a basis for discussion. The questions related to whether member states needed to pay special concern to small children where television advertising is concerned, the opinion of member states on the level and effect of the existing provisions of the Television without Frontiers Directive and to whether member states should be able to impose national restrictions on certain transfrontier broadcasts. It is clear that Sweden would favour more restrictions at a European level or the ability for individual member states to impose national restrictions on cross border broadcasts.</P>
      <P>In my intervention on the topic at the informal council, I indicated considerable sympathy with the Swedish position. However, no formal proposal on this matter is being considered by the EU. Any proposals to amend the Television without Frontiers Directive must come from the Commission and none has been put forward as yet. I should say also that I have seen no signs of a consensus in favour of further restrictions at EU level emerging.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments. Following our discussions with the Independent Radio and Television Commission, which will soon become the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, it will give priority to considering the whole question of advertising aimed at children. This is an issue which needs to be addressed immediately on a national basis.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Swedish proposals, they have encountered difficulties with the Television without Frontiers Directive on this specific issue. I have spoken in very sympathetic terms at EU meetings about their position in this regard and I will continue to do so because it mirrors the position in this country. Unfortunately, it is up to the EU Commission rather than Ministers to initiate this type of proposal. If the EU progresses the matter, I will support the Swedish position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children was not aware of the information contained in a report in the<i> Irish Independent </i>last week which suggested that a veterinary vaccine, tribovax-T, had been administered to an Irish child in 1973.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of this report, the Minister instructed the Department of Health and Children to take immediate action and, as a result, an urgent investigation is currently being carried out by the company now concerned, GlaxoSmithKline. The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Irish Medicines Board have also undertaken inquiries into the matters raised in the article. The Department has had meetings with representatives of each of these organisations in recent days. The Minister informed the House last Thursday that he would await the outcome of inquiries before considering what further action was necessary. He also telephoned senior management of the company to ensure that full co-operation would be forthcoming and he was assured that it would be. While these are early days in the context of the vast amount of documentation involved, the Minister asked for and has received, within the past few days, an initial progress report from GlaxoSmithKline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Department officials met representatives of GlaxoSmithKline last Friday afternoon and the company was asked to address three areas of concern as a matter of urgency. The three questions were: was a child vaccinated with a Wellcome vet<Col N="790" /> erinary vaccine in the early 1970s and, if so, how did this occur and were any other children affected? Did GlaxoSmithKline investigate any or all of the batches or lots listed in the adverse event schedule provided by the Eastern Health Board and, if so, what were the results of this investigation? Did the alleged administration of a veterinary vaccine to a child occur in the context of a clinical trial or as part of the vaccination programme?</P>
    <P>The Department stressed the need for urgent answers to these questions and the company sent an initial report to the Department last Tuesday, 3 July. The company has stressed that its interim report is a focused but limited review of readily available documents with the intention of providing some response as quickly as possible. It does not reflect the results of a fuller search which will take some months to complete. In that context, the company's response is as follows.</P>
    <P>In relation to the first question &ndash; was a child vaccinated with a veterinary vaccine and, if so, how and were other children involved? &ndash; the company has advised that vaccination records for children reporting adverse events relating to DTPw &ndash; Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus &ndash; for the period in question are held by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. An examination of these records by the Eastern Regional Health Authority has revealed two vaccination records where the batch number of the vaccine, as shown in the hand-written copy of the original vaccination record, is 84796, which is the lot number of the veterinary vaccine, tribovax-T.</P>
    <P>The company made the following points in that regard. First, a transcription error is highly possible. Copies of vaccination records for children with adverse events include, among others, records where the lots involved are trivax lots, numbered 84769, 84496 and 84795. Each of these three lot numbers differ from the tribovax lot number &ndash; 84796 &ndash; by only a single digit or by reversing two similar digits.</P>
    <P>Second, another factor which questions the likelihood that tribovax-T was administered to children is the fact that tribovax-T was presented in 20 ml vials containing ten doses of vaccine, each of 2 mls The carton is clearly labelled, &ldquo;tribovax&rdquo; Combined Cattle Vaccine. By contrast, trivax was presented in 5 ml vials containing ten doses, each of 0.5 mls It appears unlikely that a nurse or doctor carrying out routine vaccinations in a clinic setting could administer tribovax-T in error, given the difference in appearance of the two presentation forms. Third, the company is also looking into the unlikely possibility that tribovax-T was packed in 5 ml trivax vials, although, in its view, this is unlikely to have happened.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second question &ndash; did the company investigate any or all of the lots listed in the adverse event schedule provided by the Eastern Health Board and, if so, what were the results of this investigation, the company has advised that in its necessarily limited review over recent days, the only relevant batch analysis <Col N="791" /> records identified as having been sought from and compiled by Wellcome were details of the mentioned batches in terms of when they were manufactured and where they were sent. At this stage, the company states that no conclusion can be drawn on whether the batches were investigated fully without reviewing manufacturing records held in the United Kingdom. Given the volume of records involved, this will take some time, but the company has indicated that it intends to complete this review as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>The issue of concern in the third question is whether the adverse events occurred in the context of a clinical trial or as part of the vaccination programme. The company has advised that the names of the children on the schedule listing adverse events recorded at clinics with trivax during 1972-73 have been checked against the listing of children participating in the 1973 trial, which was investigated as part of the Chief Medical Officer's report on vaccine trials that has now been referred to the Laffoy commission, and no names match. While the company reports that it has not uncovered any documentation supporting the existence of a second trial, it has also stated that further investigation is required on this point.</P>
    <P>Clearly, in the amount of time available and given the volume of documentation involved, a complete investigation has not been possible. The Minister has been informed that a fuller review by the company will take some months to complete, but that a further report will be submitted to the Department before the end of this month. The Irish Medicines Board has requested information from the Medicines Control Agency on the inspections and standards of good manufacturing practice during the period in question as well as details of any recalls or quality defects relating to trivax or tribovax-T. It will take some time before the requested information from the UK Medicines Control Agency is available, but the Minister has been assured that the results of the IMB's inquiries will be made known as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A further indicator that a transcription error may be involved, as suggested by the company, appears in a copy vaccination record which the ERHA has uncovered. This indicates that, in the case of one of the records, the immunisation with the vaccine allegedly numbered 84796 was stated to be DT and not DTP &ndash; trivax. As there are two vaccination records showing the lot number 84796, one for a recipient of DTP &ndash; trivax &ndash; and the other DT, it appears to cast further doubt on the accuracy of record-keeping at the time.</P>
    <P>I stress that this issue is not related to the current immunisation programme and I take this opportunity to reassure parents, health professionals and the public about the safety of current vaccines. All the expert advice available to the Department indicates that the vaccines currently in use in the primary childhood immunisation programme are very safe and they are highly effective in preventing infectious diseases <Col N="792" /> in individuals and the community generally. It is important to note that vaccines are subject to rigorous testing before being licensed and they are also subject to ongoing monitoring when in use. The benefits of immunisation to children far outweigh any potential risks and help to protect them from the serious consequences of previously prevalent diseases such as polio, whooping cough and measles.</P>
    <P>Immunisation has been proven to be a very safe and effective measure in combating infectious disease in children and the community generally and has played a major part in the reduction of childhood death and illness from infectious disease. The primary childhood immunisation programme will continue to be an essential element of our health service and I urge all parents to have their children fully immunised. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>
    <P>I intend to circulate the initial report to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has said that two vaccination records quote the lot number of tribovax-T Does this indicate there are two children involved, and not one as was indicated in media reports last week?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that details of the mentioned batches, in terms of where they were manufactured and where they were sent, have been recorded. Does the Minister believe this to be unusual, given that this is the first time the Wellcome Foundation has admitted it recorded where vaccine batches were sent? In answer to previous Parliamentary Questions, Ministers have stated that the company did not have such records.</P>
      <P>What does the Department of Health and Children intend to do about the child or children who were given the veterinary vaccine? Does it intend to contact the children?</P>
      <P>Reports in last Friday's newspapers claim that Wellcome withheld information highlighting reactive batches from the Eastern Health Board. What has been the company's response to this report?</P>
      <P>What comment has the Irish Medicines Board made regarding the lack of reporting by Wellcome of adverse reactions? This is contrary to a reciprocal arrangement between the NDAB and Wellcome which was in place at the time. Does this not highlight the fact that Wellcome was trying to conceal the extent of adverse reactions to this vaccine? Would it not have damaged the progress of the vaccine trial which was taking place had the NDAB become aware of that fact? </P>

      <P>The records of the Eastern Health Board, now the Eastern Regional Health Authority, indicate that two children received the vaccine from the relevant batch No. 84796. These two children have been identified. At the time <Col N="793" /> one child experienced a localised reaction in his arm and vomited for 24 hours. The other child had no reaction. There is no evidence at this stage that other children are involved. However, investigations are continuing. We must await the outcome of the full investigation before proceeding with any action in relation to the children.</P>
      <P>The company that was Wellcome is now GlaxoSmithKline, which is a completely new company. It has given every assurance that it is committed to co-operating fully with the investigation and to giving all information at its disposal. It is carrying out a much fuller investigation than has been done to date. The Deputy is aware that the report we have is of an initial investigation.</P>
      <P>At the time there were no formal arrangements for reporting adverse reactions. Such reporting is now done as a matter of course. General practitioners now record adverse reactions, report them to the Irish Medicines Board and they are then followed up. There is now much greater accountability than was the case 30 years ago. The IMB is continuing its own much fuller investigation, as is the Eastern Regional Health Authority. When we know the outcome of these investigations and the investigation by GlaxoSmithKline I will inform the Deputies.</P>

      <P>Now that it is clear that a record was kept in the Eastern Health Board at the time and that it appears that the children received a veterinary rather than a human vaccine, can the Minister of State tell the House if their parents were informed of this? The children could be the children of Members of this House. Have the parents been advised that their children may have received veterinary vaccine?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied the system of reporting adverse reactions to vaccines is now working satisfactorily? There is an onus on general practitioners to report adverse reactions. Is the Department satisfied that parents are sufficiently informed as to the nature of an adverse reaction? The annual report of the Irish Medicines Board outlined 1,000 cases of adverse reactions for all medicines in one year. The report did not focus on immunisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that the examination of the records of the Eastern Regional Health Authority had revealed two vaccination records. At the time those vaccines were given it was not known what lot they came from or that there was even any question of the lot not being the appropriate vaccine. The question is still open. At the time there was no question of any irregularity so there would not have been a need for the parents to be told. Even today we cannot confirm that there was an irregularity. Neither can we confirm that there was not. That is why the investigation must continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current structure for reporting of adverse reactions is both formal and statutory. Because it is statutory one hopes it is adhered to. However, <Col N="794" /> it must be kept permanently under review and I accept Deputy McManus's point on that.</P>

      <P>Since this controversy arose I have been contacted by parents who have informed me that, in the 1970s, their children exhibited symptoms which tallied with an adverse reaction to a vaccine.</P>
      <P>At this stage, is it possible to ask parents to inform us about adverse reactions at that time. It is a long time ago but does the Minister of State see this as a possibility?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State envisage an independent inquiry or should it be conducted by the Joint Committee on Health and Children? Would that be a proper way to pursue this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be premature to follow the procedure outlined by Deputy Gormley. It is important that we await the outcome of the investigations by the company, the Irish Medicines Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority and look at that information in detail when it is available. I understand the company intends returning to the Department by the end of this month. I will ensure that information is made available to Deputies.</P>
      <P>This is still an open story but one about which we are very concerned. We do not have the full information. We only have the initial report and it is important that the investigations be carried out as speedily as possible. The Minister will decide what action to take on foot of the full information.</P>

      <P>Is it the intention of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to review the records for the period to see if other children were vaccinated with vaccine from lot No. 84796? Has the ERHA reviewed its documentation, as the purchasing agent in Ireland, to see if the lot was distributed to other health board areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wellcome claims this was a transcription error. Was the transcription error made in the Eastern Health Board or within Wellcome? If it did happen within the Eastern Health Board area, would Wellcome not have sought clarification at that time from the Eastern Health Board? If it was an inaccurate lot number, Wellcome could have traced it. Did that happen? I ask the Minister why the Eastern Health Board did not report the reactions to the NDAB. It is not good enough to say there was no statutory provision in place at that time. Will the Minister clarify that the Eastern Health Board in 1999 claimed that in the period 1972 to 1973, there were 73 cases of adverse reaction within three lots? However on 28 June 2000, it claimed that there was a total of 73 cases in the available records for that period of time. Last week the <i>Irish Independent </i>claimed that there were over 80 reactions between January and June of 1973, a quarter of the period of time involved. Yesterday, the Eastern Regional Health Authority claimed that there are 100 reported reactions from that period which were referred to <Col N="795" /> Wellcome. Who is correct? If the<i> Irish Independent </i>produces an article tomorrow to say that there were 250 cases, will the ERHA come back and say there are even more cases? Who is telling the truth and how many adverse reactions were there in the Eastern Health Board region and why are there no figures from other health board areas?</P>

      <P>I wish to allay people's fears. The ERHA is fully investigating all those records which are available to them from that time. The question of who made the mistake at the transcription is being investigated. It is not known at what level or at what source it may have happened. Quite obviously the reporting system of the time was very poor and was so across all the systems of 30 years ago. That is why there has been significant improvement now in reporting adverse reactions. The Irish Medicines Board has a pharmacological unit to promote, collate and analyse all the data and so ensure that the system can be protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to say if it is a fact that Wellcome withheld information regarding reactive batches from the ERHA? Is it not also a fact that Wellcome withheld information from the National Drugs Advisory Board regarding adverse reactions? Is it not also a fact that Wellcome has been slow to divulge information regarding the vaccine used, its administration and its production? Is it not also the case that at least two batches of vaccine produced in the late 1960s were at least 14 times more concentrated than the British standard at that time and that 14 batches were never subjected to the standard toxicity tests at that time? That comes to a total of four million vaccine doses that did not conform to the standard of the time. The Department of Health established the expert medical group and found that in all probability the vaccine contributed to brain damage in the cases of 16 children. The Minister for Health at the time compensated them to the tune of £10,000. Does the Minister agree that it is time to have a full public inquiry to investigate this issue so that the full information in the possession of Wellcome can be made publicly available and so that at long last parents can find out what happened to their children?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&ndash;No provision of this Act relating to changes in spending limits for a general election shall have effect in relation to the general election held next following the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We need to remind ourselves where this Bill came from. This Bill first appeared on the legislative programme when the House returned after last summer's recess. Suddenly, on the list of legislation promised from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, was a Bill called the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>I questioned the Taoiseach on a number of occasions about the purpose of this Bill. I was told innocently that it was a Bill to put candidates' photographs on ballot papers, to introduce electronic voting at elections, and a number of other similar innocuous changes to the electoral laws. I pursued the matter and asked for a briefing. I was given a briefing which amounted to a page and a half which repeated something similar but made no reference at all to what was going to be the main purpose of this legislation &ndash; to increase the amount of money Fianna Fáil could spend in a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not discover that this was the purpose of the legislation until it was published just before Christmas. Contained in the miscellaneous section of the Bill was the provision that the maximum spending limit per candidate at an election was to be increased by about 50%. The original levels were set in 1997 and were £14,000 for <Col N="798" /> a three-seat constituency, £17,000 for a four-seat constituency and £20,000 for a five-seat constituency. They were now to be increased to £20,000, £25,000 and £30,000, respectively. The only party which is going to benefit from this is the party that has raised the money, and that is Fianna Fáil. I know that in responses to criticisms I have made previously about this Bill, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has responded by saying that everybody can spend the same amount. That is nonsense. You cannot spend it unless you have it.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that what has been happening over the last number of years is that Fianna Fáil has continued in its traditional way of raising money from the corporate sector. It now has a big war chest and it wants to raise the limit of the amount that can be spent in a general election. I have tabled amendments elsewhere on this Report Stage which are seeking to reverse that and seeking to confine the spending limits to the amount that was originally intended in the 1997 Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the 1997 Act was to put into place a regime whereby candidates and political parties would be able to contest elections on a fair and relatively equitable basis. We look at other countries and send parliamentary observers to look at their elections on the basis that we want fair and free elections in other countries. The fairness of an election is also determined by the amount that can be spent by candidates at that election. If one candidate or one group of candidates can spend large amounts of money, they are in an advantaged position over those candidates who cannot do so.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the Labour Party has traditionally remained as the third political party and the third force in Irish politics is that throughout the history of the State it has had to contest elections at an unfair disadvantage as against parties such as Fianna Fáil which were funded by corporate funding and had larger war chests. That is what this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>What makes it worse is that the Bill proposes that these new spending limits are to come into operation at the next election. That places parties at an additional disadvantage because everybody else, apart from the parties in Government, was of the belief that the next general election would be contested on the basis of the limits set in 1997. It is an open secret that parties and candidates, in anticipation of a general election, had been making preliminary preparations for an elections for some time. Nobody in the House or outside was aware of an intention on the part of the Government to raise the limits until the Bill was published last Christmas. However, the Government was aware of it. We know now, because <i>Magill</i> magazine published documents or extracts from documents it had received under the Freedom of Information Act, that as far back as February 2000 the Minister for the Environment gave an instruction to his officials to include this provision in the Bill. If that instruction was given in February 2000 it is fair to assume it was being <Col N="799" /> hatched for some time. The parties in Government, or at least Fianna Fáil, had been aware for the past 18 months that it was the intention to raise the spending limits for a general election. It was hatched and put together but the Bill did not appear until December 2000. The very minimum the House should do is ensure the new limits do not apply at the next general election. If they are to apply at the next general election there will be a double disadvantage for the Opposition. There is a disadvantage in terms of spending capacity for those of us in parties who do not have the capacity to raise large wads of money. That applies also to Independent candidates. There is a disadvantage because we are being asked to contest the next election on the basis of rules which were known to the Government side for 18 months but which were not known to anybody else until the Bill was published. That disadvantage has practical implications because parties or candidates who were making preliminary preparations for an election and who were making arrangements about the kind of posters and literature they might, design work etc. made those plans on the assumption that the spending limits would be as set out in the 1997 legislation. There could be an election before the House resumes. The limits are being changed in the last lap before a general election but they should not apply to the next general election. It is not unusual to put a stay on the implementation of some provisions of legislation. Ministers use statutory instruments to commence certain sections or not to commence certain sections of legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Government was of the view that the limits were too low, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and let us see how we fare at the next election. If the purpose of the legislation was as I suspect, to confer an advantage on Fianna Fail at the next election then the Minister of State, who has been a critic and an opponent of Fianna Fáil during much of his political career, will turn down this amendment. I look forward to a favourable reply.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which arises out of our discussion on Committee Stage in respect of an amendment which has been resubmitted as amendment No. 30, seeks to prevent the Government increasing the spending limits proposed in 1997. I oppose the increase for the good reasons outlined by Deputy Gilmore because there was no demand for them from either side and certainly no public demand. Also I felt it put us back on that treadmill of fundraising and dependence on corporate donations and that grey area which has meshed us in tribunals and brought politics into disrepute. It is something we were trying to get away from. Why did the Government use a Bill which was supposed to about putting photographs on ballot papers and introducing electronic voting to introduce by the backdoor this increase in spending? I was <Col N="800" /> opposed to the increase in spending. The timing of the increase is unforgivable. The reality is that those spending limits set in 1997 were for the next general election. They have not yet been tested. There is no way of knowing whether they are adequate. The reality is that one always tries to spend the most one can. If the limit is low, the amount that can be spent is low. We would all get used to it, irrespective of how difficult it might be in the beginning and would lower our sights and reduce the glossiness of our posters and so on. We would have got used to it and we would have survived and it would have been fair competition. It is the timing of the change to which I object. There has been much discussion about the unconstitutionality of other amendments to the Bill. This is the element of the Bill which I regard as unconstitutional. The two Government parties are playing by a new set of rules which the rest of us did not hear about. We have all done our fund raising and made our plans. We knew exactly how much we could spend at the next election and planned accordingly. Others who knew the rules made other plans and have ordered the glossy posters. There cannot be a fair game where if one does not know the rules one will be the automatic loser. If this amendment is not accepted and the new limits are operational before the next election it will definitely be challenged. I ask the Minister to seriously consider accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 1. He reflects on the intent of the Bill to aid Fianna Fáil's electoral adventures. What Deputy Gilmore failed to state is that in another section, not only is it kinked in one respect but other elements of this Bill seek to disadvantage the party I represent by further curtailing the opportunity to legitimately raise funds. It is important to recognise that we do not have a level playing field and we will not have one. If amendment No. 1 is not adopted, we will have a situation, particularly in the four and five seat constituencies, where an inordinate spending limit will apply in relation to the larger parties, especially Fianna Fáil, as against a sole and solitary Deputy like me and others of my colleagues standing in such constituencies across the State. Invariably, the larger parties will field three and even four candidates, depending on the strategy they adopt. In Cavan-Monaghan, for instance, that would mean a potential spending limit of the order of £120,000 for one set of opinions, as against a £30,000 limit applying to me. I would not be able to raise £30,000 anyway. We have a further disadvantage in that regard in terms of being able to present our case in the various ways we do at election time. I support the amendment and urge the Minister of State to accept it.</P>

      <P>As Deputies have outlined, the amendment proposes that the election expenditure limits in the Bill will not have effect for the next general election. Section 1 provides that the <Col N="801" /> Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders. The election expenditure limits are intended to assist candidates meet expenditure at the next general election or a by-election if one should occur before the general election, without the need to be constantly worried, during the election period, about committing a criminal offence if the limit is exceeded. The existing limits have been used at each by-election since 1998 and we know that two of the parties involved in Opposition have had some difficulties, in one way or another, with those limits.</P>
      <P>The new limits were well heralded by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, as far back as 1997 when the Electoral Act, 1997, then the Electoral Bill, 1994, was considered by the Oireachtas. He was then in Opposition. While accepting the principle of expenditure limits, he asked that the then proposed limits be reconsidered as they were not adequate for parties which nominated more than one candidate in a constituency. The Minister did not make any concession on the proposed limits to meet the expressed concerns. The limits now proposed in the Bill by the present Minister, Deputy Dempsey, are in line with the limits which he formerly proposed as spokesman on environment and local government for his party. The new limits will not provide one additional pound to any political party. The proposed limits are the same for every candidate. The only reason any party would be entitled to a larger expenditure increase arises from the number of candidates which that party decides to nominate. There is nothing in the legislation to prevent the Labour Party nominating the same number of candidates as other parties. If the present Labour Party nominates the same number of candidates as it and the former DL party did at the 1997 general election, it will be entitled to spend an extra £440,000. As I have stated at other Stages of the Bill, the then Labour Party Minister for the Environment said in 1997 that the amounts he proposed then were not expected to be written in stone.</P>
      <P>To sum up, there is a view that the current limits will not be adequate at the general election. After the next general election the Minister does not wish to see elected Members being investigated by the Public Offices Commission and the DPP in relation to moderate expenditure over the limits proposed by the Opposition. There will be tough competition at the general election and, in the heat of the campaign, candidates could easily exceed the current limits. We have seen some instances of that in the by-elections held to date. It would place a huge onus on candidates and election managers to remain within the low levels proposed by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of a small party which has run two candidates in a number of constituencies. There is nothing to stop the Labour Party running more than one candidate if it feels disadvantaged in terms of expenditure limits by running only one candidate. That is a party policy decision. Hearing Sinn Féin speak of not having <Col N="802" /> enough money, many people would take that with a grain of salt, having regard to the quite extraordinary sums of money that party seems to be in a position to spend.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the amendment. All of the issues were well debated on Committee Stage. Many of Deputy Gilmore's arguments are quite spurious and very pointed politically, seeking to create an image of money being transferred to one party to give it an advantage over others when, in fact, it is open to any party. My party does not have access to large funds. We have to run fundraising functions. We have two limitations in that regard, namely our own level of success and the overall limit laid down in legislation. People who are convinced they have a message worth selling can readily go out and raise funds.</P>

      <P>I will avail of the two minutes on the understanding that I can reply later. If my comments were politically pointed, it is only because this Bill is politically motivated. This Bill is about conferring advantage. The Minister of State spoke about the Labour Party running one candidate in a constituency. When contesting a constituency where our party has two candidates, both of whom are setting out to win, this Bill would, in theory, allow us to spend £60,000 on that campaign. We will not spend a fraction of that. We will not even spend a fraction of the £40,000 allowed under the 1997 legislation. I also heard a Deputy from the Government side of the House say, on a radio programme recently, that he would not ever spend anything near the 1997 limit.</P>
      <P>Where has the idea come from that the 1997 limits would be too low? The Minister of State links it to the by-elections. The by-election card has been played a number of times in this debate although, to be fair to the Minister of State, he has not overplayed it this time as was done on previous occasions. First, the Public Offices Commission has not pursued any complaint about the by-elections. Second, as most people would acknowledge, what happens at a by election is that effectively, candidates replicate what happens in a general election, albeit with a smaller number of candidates. The only argument that would give rise to is perhaps, that there should be a different regime for by-elections. The 1997 limits have not been tested at all in an election. We should at least allow them to be tested.</P>

      <P>In response to the Minister of State's answer to the initial case put, it is important to note here that this Bill is not only about allowing for an increased advantage to those parties who field a number of candidates. <Col N="803" /> The Minister of State spoke of funding for Sinn Féin. Clearly, this Bill has, as one of its core intents, a section designed to curtail the fundraising opportunities which Sinn Féin has successfully exploited in recent years &ndash; and I emphasise in recent years &ndash; starting from a very low base. Let us also face the reality. I am a sole Deputy in this House. I know the very small level that the organisation with which I work directly in my constituency has enjoyed from that intake. The reality is that this party contests all elections in this jurisdiction, the Westminster elections and the Assembly and local elections in the North of Ireland. The democratic commitment and cost consequential on that involvement by Sinn Féin is significantly greater than is realised. As the only all-Ireland party on the island, we incur significant expenditure in ensuring we put our message forward throughout the length and breadth of the island. We are not comparing like with like. It is also very important that if the Minister is serious about accommodating equal opportunity for all, he agrees to accept amendment No. 23 which I have tabled and which would delete the offending section which seeks to curtail the opportunity of the party I am proud to represent.</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister that the response he gave to this amendment is precisely the same as that which he gave on Committee Stage to amendments in respect of the donation limits. This amendment is quite different in that it refers to the timing of the introduction of the measure, which undoubtedly the Government will put through. It is changing the rules after the game has started but only telling one of the teams of the change. That will be found to be unconstitutional, and I ask the Minister to think very carefully about ignoring the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply, the intention is on the record since 1997. One point has not been raised by the Deputies opposite who have referred to the expenditure limits. The limits apply to the aggregate expenditure of parties in relation to their number of candidates. The headquarters spend on the election campaign will be taken into account, so the full amount mentioned here will not be available to each candidate in each constituency. The spend by the party at national level for the national campaign must be deducted from what is available to each candidate. Therefore, this cannot be compared with a by-election, which is held in one constituency in a confined area with no national spend. The costs of a quarter page advertisement in a national newspaper will quickly make a big hole in these sums of money. We should be realistic, therefore. Costs are advancing and to put in the low limits would result in quite a large number of elected Deputies finding themselves subsequent to the election in serious difficulties. I do not think the Deputies opposite are living in the real world in <Col N="804" /> relation to the amendment they have tabled, and I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <P>The Bill seriously reverses the legislation which was put in place by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, when we were in Government, which was aimed at providing some degree of fairness in the contest of elections. In replying to my earlier remarks the Minister said that Deputy Dempsey, the author of this Bill, or at least of this provision, has been consistent in his view on this matter and that these limits now proposed are those he argued for in 1997. If the Minister is being consistent and if he has had a continuing wish to change the provision in the 1997 Act, why was it not included in the programme for Government of 1997? Why did we not hear anything about it from the Minister from 1997 until the Bill was published at the end of 2000? Why at no stage in any discussion we have had in the House relating to electoral or related matters, or during opportunities given to him on Question Time, did he not tell the House that it was his intention to reverse the limits in the legislation introduced by Deputy Howlin and enacted by the House? Why was this kept a secret and only released at the last minute when the Bill was published at the end of 2000? Why, despite all the times I questioned it from the first moment it was indicated that an electoral Bill would be introduced, was no answer given at any stage by the Taoiseach or the Minister indicating it was on their minds to increase the spending limits, even though those questions were asked after the Government had made a decision and the Minister had given an instruction to his officials to include this provision in the Bill? There has been a history of concealment by the Government on this matter; the plan was hatched to increase the limits so more could be spent by the party at the next election, but it was decided to tell nobody about it as to do so would mean they would not have had the same advantage. It was kept quiet until the Bill was published.</P>
      <P>We have a double jeopardy for the Opposition. We have the reversal of legislation which we introduced in Government and which was intended to provide a fair basis for the contest of elections and to end the scandal whereby corporate money being received by Fianna Fáil could buy election results on polling day, and it is being done in a way which disadvantages the Opposition by having concealed that information from it until the Bill was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this measure is in place for the next general election, it will be fought on an unfair basis, with one party being able to spend large amounts of money which it has collected from the corporate sector over the past four years while other parties have not been in a position to raise that kind of money. The two parties which constitute the Government will be contesting the election on the basis of knowledge they had about spending limits 18 months in advance of the rest of the House. That is not a fair contest and the elections <Col N="805" /> will not be fair. This is yet another example of the damage the Government is doing to democracy in the last couple of weeks of this session. The Labour Party will not support that, and I appeal to every Member to vote in favour of the amendment I am putting to ensure the next election is contested on some kind of fair basis and not on <Col N="806" /> the basis of the kind of distorted advantage the Government is seeking to give to itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>3.&ndash;A political party, the President, a member of the either House of the Oireachtas, of the European Parliament, of a local authority or of Údarás na Gaeltachta, or a candidate for any of the said offices, shall not directly or indirectly accept a donation for political (including electoral) purposes from any person (including a body corporate) other than a Dáil elector.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This brings us to the second core issue in this Bill, the funding of political parties and politicians. This amendment seeks to ban corporate funding of political parties and politicians and to limit funding to Dáil electors. Last May 12 months, the Labour Party proposed a Private Members' Bill to ban the corporate funding of political parties and politicians. It did so against the background of revelations from the tribunals which have deeply disturbed the public and which have had a deeply undermining effect on democracy. It is no longer acceptable to the people that corporate entities should be paying money to political parties and politicians. We know from the history of the funding of politics here that corporate donations and corporate funding was very much part of that to a greater or lesser extent depending on the party. It is no longer acceptable to the public.</P>
      <P>A majority of Members want to see it end. All the Opposition parties are opposed to continued corporate funding of politics. A number of the Minister's colleagues on the Government benches are also in favour of banning corporate funding. Deputy Fleming, for example, has spoken about this as has the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. A number of Deputies on the Government side are opposed to continued corporate funding of politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill, the Government proposes to limit corporate funding to £5,000 in the case of a party and £2,000 in the case of an individual. The Labour Party's view is that it should be completely banned. This country requires an action to be taken by the Houses of the Oireachtas which puts beyond any doubt and any equivocation that there can continue to be a financial link between corporate business and politics. The majority of the people believe that if contributions are made by companies, there must be some<i> quid pro quo. </i>While individual Members argue that is not the case, that they are bona fides contributions to political parties and that irrespective of the contribution, Deputies, Ministers or office holders do their job with integrity and are not influenced by whatever contributions are made to the political <Col N="807" /><Col N="808" /> party, the fact is that right now it is the public belief that if the piper is paid, the tune is called. We have to be unequivocal in putting an end to it.</P>
    <P>It is going to end anyway. It is only a matter of time before the complete ban on the corporate funding of politics and politicians is enshrined in our law. I appeal to the Minister and the Government side not to continue to inflict damage on the body politic of this country by continuing to hold on to corporate funding of politics.</P>
    <P>It is damaging and should be ended. The Labour Party Private Members' Bill was passed unanimously on Second Stage in May 2000 and the acceptance in principle of the need to ban corporate funding should be reflected in this Bill. The Government obstructed the Labour Party Bill on Committee Stage, although the Bill had been referred to the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government, on the basis that it intended to introduce its own measures in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in this Bill are not even a half-way house. Action must be taken to restore confidence in politics. To say that limits of £5,000 per party and £2,000 per individual are being imposed will not convince anyone, particularly when many people will never in their lives have those sums in credit in their bank accounts. My proposal, which the Government should accept, seeks to end the corporate funding of politics and the Government should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on amendment No. 3 in my name which I have changed since it was discussed on Committee Stage as the Minister suggested a particular aspect could be unconstitutional. I have changed limiting donations to Dáil electors to any individual. The main thrust of my amendment is to end corporate donations.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has already renounced corporate donations and has placed itself at some disadvantage by so doing. However, we felt it was important to publicly extricate ourselves from the grey area of interdependency with the business sector and we hoped we would encourage other parties to do likewise. Almost all of us have in the past depended on corporate donations which we accepted without feeling in any way compromised. The position has changed utterly in recent years and we discussed the extent of this change this morning during the debate on the Flood tribunal. Corporate donations are not necessarily compromising but they can be and the public perception is that they are. We are aware of cases in which such donations were compromising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public perception is what matters most now because people's confidence in the democratic process has been seriously undermined. We must not merely tinker with the amounts involved although I accept the Government has considerably reduced the limits. At one point, a limit of £20,000 was suggested but that has decreased to £5,000. We must completely extricate ourselves <Col N="809" /> from reliance on corporate donations. It is not merely a matter of changing the rules, we must change the entire way in which we do business.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains proposals for substantial increases in State funding for political parties from which all parties have in the past shied away for a variety of reasons. The public is now ready to accept State funding. People realise that the democratic process must be funded and must choose between the old way and the new way. They are sick of the old system and want us to move towards the completely transparent funding of democracy. There is no more transparent way in which to do this than to use taxpayers' money for which we are all ultimately accountable. The <i>quid pro quo </i>of public acceptance of State political funding is that any other form of funding must be abandoned. We cannot have half measures and opt for a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Corporate donations will be banned sooner or later but this should happen now. I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>I wish to record my opposition to amendment No. 2 and my support for amendments Nos. 3 and 28. This issue opens up a whole new vista for many people. Amendment No. 23 in my name seeks the deletion of section 49 which proposes to exclude everyone but Irish citizens from contributing to the political endeavours of the political party of their choice in this jurisdiction. We must recognise the historical displacement of generations of people who have been keen participants as opposed to mere observers or spectators in the unfolding of and, hopefully, irreversible drive towards a real and lasting peace on and between these islands.</P>
      <P>The thrust of amendment No. 2 and that of the original text and intent of this Bill, based on the original Labour Party Bill, is to deny these people the opportunity to contribute in a practical way to the politics of their choice. We must acknowledge their enormous contribution and recognise their role in establishing contact with and securing the critical intervention of the former President of the United States. It is not only the displaced generations of Irish people in the US who have warmly embraced the new opportunity for peace and invested in a new political dispensation on this island. Members of the Irish diaspora in Britain, Australia, Europe and elsewhere have also done so. These people have been denied their right to vote and the debate which has been ongoing for years has never focused on decision making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those displaced in recent decades should have been afforded the opportunity to continue to exercise their franchise in the same way as many other democracies accommodate their citizens overseas. These people have been denied their right to reach their natural potential as citizens in this land because of the failed economic policies of successive Governments. Having already been denied their right to vote, they are now to be denied the right to contribute to building a new <Col N="810" /> political dispensation on this island. It is open to everyone to appeal and reach out to the Irish diaspora for support and Sinn Féin has done so successfully. When compared with the major Government party the figures are not, in real terms, of the order implied by the exaggerated tones of some media commentators. Sinn Féin has been successful in that and it must be acknowledged that has been an important contribution.</P>
    <P>What we must address is the cutting off of the role and the hold the corporate body has on the political destinies of this and future Administrations. I acknowledge that Deputy Olivia Mitchell has amended her position in amendment No. 3 and that is why I give it my wholehearted support. Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 28 equally seeks to address the issue of putting an end to the role of corporate funding and the control and influence of big business in the political decision making in this land. That is a positive and worthwhile objective.</P>
    <P>Under the guise of addressing corporation donations, it is wrong to seek to cut off Irish citizens and those who are further out generationally, who do not have an immediate claim or who have not gone through the paper work required for gaining Irish citizenship, who have made contributions to all of the political parties represented in this debate without exception. That is a factual position. This is part of maintaining the ties. People do not want to cut the umbilical cord that holds them to the land of their birth or the land of the birth of their parents or grandparents. That is a good thing. It has stood this country in great stead on many levels. It is sad that much of the broad thrust of recent legislation excludes, debars or states some people cannot stand for election or stand for election for mayor or cathaoirleach, or make a contribution. This negative and destructive energy that seems to have dominated the thrust of legislation in the recent past is depressing. There is little of a positive nature that truly seeks to include, involve and to bring in from the margins, reflected in any of the legislation we have had to address in the recent past. This is another example of one of the core deficiencies in the thinking behind the drafting of this legislation. It reflects another body of people to be left out, excluded and disqualified.</P>
    <P>I strongly oppose amendment No. 2, I support amendments Nos. 3 and 28 and I recommend amendment No. 23 in my name to the Minister of State to ensure we allow for the continued contribution of people who have a genuine interest in the future based on peace, progress and prosperity for all who view this island as home.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to speak on this amendment. I am particularly surprised by the comments of my <Col N="811" /> Sinn Féin colleague. I understand he opposes the Labour Party amendment in the name of my colleague, Deputy Gilmore. I do not know how anyone can say corporate contributions from the United States, Canada, Australia or Great Britain can be given to Sinn Féin or any other party on the basis that they are a contribution towards the peace process and at the same time say corporate donations should not be given to assist a political party in an election campaign. This is new thinking. That would need to be debated in the broadest sense because contributions from the United States to political parties have always been the subject not only of suspicion regarding the support of political parties such as Fianna Fáil and, in particular, Sinn Féin for the political process and what those funds are designated for. There is a double barrelled reason corporate contributions or donations from the United States should cease at the same time as donations from corporate organisations should be barred in the Republic of Ireland. I cannot see how one could say corporate donations should cease to all political parties, which is something I have always believed, and at the same time say it is all right if corporate donations are given to Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or any other political party from the United States.</P>

      <P>There should be an even playing pitch. Sinn Féin should not be allowed to have corporate donations from the United States while at the same time we are seeking to debar the Labour Party and all other political parties from receiving corporate donations in the Republic of Ireland. That would be totally and utterly inconsistent with what we are trying to achieve in this legislation. There can be only one even playing pitch. The amendment proposes that corporate donations should cease, whether they be from the United States, Australia, UK or here to Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party or any other party. The State should fund the political organisation of this State in a democratic way based on the numerical strength of the political parties involved. This is the most important amendment to this legislation. I would be surprised and disappointed if our colleague from Sinn Féin were to vote against the Labour Party amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 propose that only donations from a Dáil elector or an individual can be accepted. Other donations, whether from corporate or incorporated bodies, would be prohibited. The Bill provides for limit<Col N="812" /> ing donations to political parties and third parties to £5,000 and £2,000 for individuals.</P>
      <P>In so far as amendment No. 2 is concerned, it would not be feasible to restrict donors to Dáil electors. Electors who are not Dáil electors but who are eligible to vote at European Parliament and local elections should also be entitled to make a donation to a political party or a candidate. I do not know how one can make the distinction that seems to have been made here.</P>
      <P>As I stated at some length on other Stages, I do not accept that it is practical or feasible to distinguish between corporate or non-corporate donations. I do not think it is fair to compare the current position with that which existed in the past which may have led to the events being disclosed in Dublin Castle in connection with a few individuals. The regulatory context in which we operate here today is substantially different from that which obtained when those events took place. The disclosure requirements that are now in operation would have assisted in highlighting or in preventing some of the matters, if not all of them, being investigated by the tribunals.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposals in the Bill on limiting donations for political purposes will provide an open and transparent system for all and that is the important thing we have achieved. Some Deputies acknowledged on Second Stage that the Government had moved towards their parties' position in this matter and that has been acknowledged here today.</P>
      <P>I believe the public will agree that the Government's proposals are the proper way to go forward and arguments about whether a cheque is a personal or business one is not the real issue. The real issue is openness, accountability and disclosure.</P>
      <P>While respecting the Labour Party policy on this matter, I ask it to consider that other parties differ from it. The Labour Party policies are not infallible, nor does it have absolute righteousness on its side, as I said on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>If that was the case, why did the Labour Party not ban corporate donations when bringing in the Electoral Act in 1997? I note Fine Gael said 12 months ago in a published document that it does not believe it is possible to distinguish between corporate and individual donations and the Government could not agree more with that. The legal advice we received from the Attorney General also agrees with that.</P>
      <P>Contributing to the funds of political parties is a legitimate practice, whether one is an individual putting £1 in a collection plate, a trade union sponsoring a candidate or an industrialist making a corporate donation. Political parties perform an essential function in a democratic society and it is in society's interests that they should have sources to carry out that function effectively, as effective political parties are essential to a healthy democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the size of proposed donation limits is a matter for political debate, the Government does not accept that there should be a ban on corpor<Col N="813" /> ate donations. That was the considered view of Fine Gael until it recently changed leaders. The key fact in this area is disclosure and the current disclosure limits and procedures will continue. The Government, in the absence of co-operation from other parties, has produced a sensible and operative scheme of donation limits which is reasonable for all concerned. This is the first time limits in donations to political parties and individuals have been introduced and they are at quite a low level compared with what was initially considered.</P>
    <P>The Government had to consider what levels would be reasonable having regard to the rights of free speech in our Constitution and the European Charter of Human Rights. The proposals had to be seen to be fair while at the same time protecting a person's right to free expression with moderate limitation. While there is no ideal model for the financing of political parties, the system proposed by the Government based on a reasonable balance between public and private funding, with the other legislative measures in the Bill and before the Oireachtas, will contribute to improving standards and to restoring public confidence and trust in public life.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 seeks to delete the provisions for the prohibition of the acceptance of certain foreign donations. There is already a framework in place for the regulation of political financing and the conduct of political activity in the State. Regarding donations, there is now a transparent regime for disclosures of donations to political parties, public representatives and candidates at elections. Anonymous donations in excess of specified amounts are prohibited and the Bill consolidates the existing disclosure regime with the introduction of limits and the requirement to open special donation accounts.</P>
    <P>All these measures are intended to preserve the integrity of and restore credibility to the political process. Continuing to allow unrestricted access to foreign donations has the potential to seriously undermine the effectiveness of the wide-ranging measures I have mentioned. Furthermore, in a climate where all political activity has been conducted in a strict regulatory regime, unrestricted access to foreign donations could result in a particular party, individual or organisation becoming resourced to such an extent as to gain an overwhelming advantage over other parties or organisations in its access to the media, ability to campaign and generally engage in political activity. I support Deputy Bell's comments in that regard. The prohibition does not apply to Irish citizens resident abroad. To meet the constitutional rights of all citizens the Government has considered the matter fully and its decision is reflected in this Bill. Amendment No. 28 would prohibit donations from the corporate sector and that is not acceptable for the reasons I have given.</P>
    <P>As I cannot accept these amendments I ask that they be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Bell's contribution, I happily confirm for him that I am all for a level playing field and I am sorry he is confused about the points I have made. I reaffirm that I am completely opposed to corporate contributions from any source, be they in the United States, here at home or in any other jurisdiction. Let us reach that point of agreement at least and then we can look at the deficiency in amendment No. 2 he recommends to me.</P>
      <P>How can I possibly support an amendment that seeks to limit contributions solely and only to those who are Dáil electors? I live a few miles short of the Border, nearer to it than Deputy Bell and I am sure he has no doubt that the effect of this amendment, if it became a core element of the Bill, would be to exclude a contribution from any of my party colleagues in the North and members of my family and friends who reside in the North. It is an absolute absurdity. The situation is only marginally improved &ndash; which I acknowledged to the Minister of State on Committee Stage and do again now &ndash; where we are at least looking at Irish citizens, which incorporates the whole island, but the Labour Party amendment seeks to restrict this to those who are registered Dáil electors in this jurisdiction. That is another act of copper-fastening partition and is anathema to me; it is in antipathy to everything I stand for and hold dear.</P>
      <P>I recommend amendment No. 23 and in the true spirit of addressing the issue of corporate donations I have already indicated I will support Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 3. I will also support the Labour Party's amendment No. 28, Deputy Bell will be pleased to note, but I am sorry I cannot support amendment No. 2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed that the Minister of State will not accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>I am also surprised and disappointed by the strength of opposition to the amendment from Deputy Ó Caoláin. The Labour Party amendment proposes banning corporate funding. The question of constitutionality &ndash; whether this can be done &ndash; has been raised previously, though we did not see any legal advice produced by the Government in relation to it. The Labour Party took the view that to have a funding regime for political parties which was constitutional, it had to be based on the constitutional entitlement to participate in the politics of the State. That constitutional entitlement lays down who may vote and it is our view and advice that a funding regime based on that constitutional entitlement, the entitlement to be registered to vote, is constitutional and would therefore guarantee the banning of corporate donations. That is the rationale for our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is pain in this amendment for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, which have raised funds through corporate donations. There is pain in this for the Labour Party, as it also bans funding from trade unions. <Col N="815" /> It is unreasonable of Deputy Ó Caoláin to make an argument which, however much it is dressed up in the coded language we hear from Sinn Féin &ndash; wrap the diaspora and the peace process around me and for God's sake do not say anything to offend Sinn Féin &ndash; suggests a funding arrangement which bans corporate donations but lets Sinn Féin continue to raise funds in the United States. That is the argument he is making.</P>
    <P>It is also unfair to the millions of Irish people and those of Irish descent in America and elsewhere who have expressed a view on Irish politics and the way this State and island should develop to imply that only those who put their hands in their pockets for Sinn Féin are contributing. Millions of people of Irish descent are actively contributing to the well being of the country and never make a contribution to any political party, including Sinn Féin. I expected Deputy Ó Caoláin to espouse the peculiar argument that it is appropriate that large sums of money collected from outside the State be used to influence the politics and self-determination of the people. I do not accept that. Deputy Ó Caoláin should not be making this kind of argument which favours the banning of corporate donations but wants Sinn Féin to keep its right to raise money abroad. It is a dishonest argument and I am disappointed he has pursued it with such vigour.</P>
    <P>The core of the amendment concerns the banning of corporate donations. A clean break must be made on the issue. The limits that are proposed are presented as limits of £5,000 and £2,000. They are not the real limits because those <Col N="816" /> are annual amounts. For example, the Government's proposal will permit a company, assuming that there is a five year interval between general elections, to give £25,000 to a party in the period between two general elections. Alternatively, it will permit a company to give £10,000 to an individual between two general elections. Those are sizeable sums of money from any perspective.</P>
    <P>The proposal will also permit a series of companies to make separate donations. It is not unusual these days for there to be a sequence of related companies, each of which could separately make a contribution. For example, if there were four related companies in the same group, they could effectively make a contribution of £100,000 to a political party between two general elections. That means we are back to square one because the sums of money involved are very substantial.</P>
    <P>The only way to prevent this is to ban it entirely. The Labour Party accepts the logic and consequences of that as far as trade union contributions to the Labour Party are concerned. In a regime where there is a ban on corporate funding and where employers are no longer funding political parties, the original rationale for the trade union funding of a party to represent workers' interests would no longer apply anyway. We accept this, as should Sinn Féin in so far as it applies to its own fund raising activities. I want to put the amendment to a vote and I hope Deputy Ó Caoláin, on reflection, will support me in it.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a thabairt as cead an tairiscint seo a thabairt. The announcement yesterday that Herdmans of Ballybofey is closing down, with the loss of 85 jobs, came as a bombshell to the Ballybofey and Finn valley areas. Herdmans is a unique company and has provided valuable employment for many years on both sides of the Border. It set an example of what cross-Border industrial co-operation can achieve. This is the second major blow to the Finn valley area in recent months. In January, Nena Models in Stranorlar laid off a total of 43 employees. This was also a severe blow to industrial employment in the Finn valley.</P>
      <P>The closure of Herdmans in Ballybofey leaves industrial and unemployment devastation in its wake and it is another chapter in the long and sad litany of factory closures and job losses throughout County Donegal in recent years. If one includes Fruit of the Loom, I estimate that there have been at least 3,000 job losses in Donegal in recent years. No county can afford such a haemorrhage of employment. The employees of Herdman's have given long and loyal service to the company. Many of them are the sole breadwinners for their families. Many are mortgage holders and are burdened with many more financial responsibilities. The announcement is a shock to those who now face a bleak future on the unemployment register. It will also have serious economic implications for that part of County Donegal.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, the IDA published its annual report which once more makes sad reading for Donegal and the north west. It again puts the region at the bottom of the list for job creation. Every region, with the exception of Donegal and the north west, shows significant increases in the numbers employed in IDA assisted industries. While total jobs created nationally increased by more than 16,000, there was an overall reduction of 96 in the north west. This is not an isolated occurrence. The same trend has continued each year since 1996. It is disgraceful and obviously the political commitment is not forthcoming to reverse the situation.</P>
      <P>The Government appears to be taking Donegal for granted. The huge political support it receives from the county, where five out of six Deputies are supporters, is not obviously appreciated by the Government. At this stage, we are sick of rhetoric and empty promises. We cannot continue year after year to receive such body blows on the employment front. It is no wonder that Donegal is top of the league as far as unemployment is concerned, but bottom of the league as far as new jobs are concerned. I am asking that an emergency plan be adopted for the Finn valley. This area should immediately be declared a top priority region for job replacement. I refer not alone to Ballybofey-Stranorlar where this factory is located, but to other towns such as Drumkeen, Convoy, Castlefin and Killygordon.</P>
      <P>It may not be too late to retrieve the serious situation in Herdmans. I appeal to the Minister and to all Government agencies to come together to save as many of these jobs as possible. For those who are losing their livelihoods, a generous package of remuneration must be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> I have stood here on too many occasions in recent years to make pleas such as this on the occasion of closures in County Donegal. I hope I will not have to do so again in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for raising this matter. I share his disappointment at the announcement of the closure of the Herdmans plant, as does my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Coughlan. We are all equally conscious of the employment situation in Donegal and of the needs of that area.</P>
      <P>Herdmans (Ireland) Limited, was established in Ballybofey, County Donegal, in 1965, by Herdmans Limited of Sion Mills, County Tyrone, to produce linen yarn for final finishing at the Sion Mills facility. Over the years this process worked well but as costs continued to rise and the world price of linen continued to fall, Herdmans have been incurring losses in recent years. It is understood that the company has also been experiencing difficulties in relation to its effluent treatment facilities which will require considerable expenditure to rectify and which the company cannot afford. Based on these facts, the company has proposed to close the Ballybofey operation and let go the 59 full-time and 28 temporary staff at the plant.</P>
      <P>FÁS has already been in contact with the company to offer its full range of services, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews and identification of training needs. Depending on the requirements and needs of the staff, suitable training courses will be run and every effort will be made to find alternative employment.</P>
      <P>Over the past 18 months IDA Ireland has radically changed its strategy with a view to achieving a better regional distribution of jobs. The agency's new strategy includes a focused sectoral and geographical approach for new inward investment projects, coupled with an added value focus for the existing base of overseas industry in each region. This new strategy also provides for an upgrading of IDA Ireland land in regional locations and the provision of new modern facilities in appropriate locations to cater for the emerging sectors.</P>
      <P>In this context, IDA's strategies for Donegal have been formulated and tailored following a wide consultative process to meet the specific needs of the area. The agency's regional office was re-established in Letterkenny and the agency is in the process of relocating a number of key operating units into the north-west region. Engineering and consumer products, along with a section of international services are relocating in Sligo. This move is designed to stimulate and support growth from within the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA's strategy for the region is beginning to show positive results and the agency is confident that the recovery of jobs in the area will become <Col N="822" /> more apparent as the new projects which have been approved make their impact in the years ahead. In this regard significant developments in Donegal will impact positively on the Finn valley region as it is located approximately 20 or 30 minutes from Letterkenny, which is the main focus of IDA's activity in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Phase 1 of the development of Letterkenny Business Park has been completed. PacifiCare, which currently employs 180 people, now occupies building one. The company recently announced an expansion project to create an additional 160 jobs at full development. Work is nearing completion on the provision of a second 25,000 square foot advance factory at the park and planning permission has been sought for a third advance factory.</P>
    <P>Prudential Insurance Company of America has a new office facility at Letterkenny Office Park and currently employs 150 people. That company will expand its operation in Letterkenny with the support of IDA Ireland, and will add 325 new jobs by the end of 2003, with a potential for a further 125 new jobs as the operation develops.</P>
    <P>Other job expansions in the area include the following: Kirchhoff Ireland recently announced an expansion involving an additional 50 people at full development; Interventional Technologies (IVT) has announced plans to create an additional 90 jobs through the expansion of its existing operation in Letterkenny; and Abbott Laboratories in Donegal town, which employs 550 people, announced plans to invest £50 million with the support of IDA Ireland for the development of its operation which will secure the future of the facility. IDA is also marketing vacant facilities previously occupied by Fruit of the Loom at Raphoe.</P>
    <P>In addition to these positive developments, the implementation of the recommendations of the Donegal employment initiative task force has been allocated to the county development board. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are participating in the work of the board. Also as part of IDA's regional agenda for the north-west region the agency has put in place a programme to encourage the development of infrastructure, skills and education in the region to enhance its attractiveness for new inward investment. Work is ongoing in the areas of roads, telecommunications and electricity as these are particular issues to be addressed.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland and IDB Northern Ireland have put in place a joint marketing programme for the north-west region, which includes Counties Donegal and Derry. The initiative involves the marketing of the region by overseas executives to potential investors. Some of the work to date has included the setting up of a joint database of information. Familiarisation trips for the relevant executives of IDA and IDB have also been arranged. Other areas of co-operation are being explored, including the development of a website and a cross-Border business park.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> I am confident that the strategy being pursued by IDA Ireland for the north-west region will result in the creation of good and enduring employment for the Donegal and Finn valley areas.</P>

      <P>Melissa Corcoran is a 16 year old young woman from Balbriggan. Melissa has an unknown hypothalamic syndrome, features of which are hypo-pituitarism, expressed as growth hormone deficiency, TRH/TSH/thyroid deficiency, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal insufficiency, hypothalamic pituitary ovarian insufficiency, partial diabetes insipidus and abnormal thirst. She has abnormal body temperature control and is prone to hypothermia. She is being maintained on a wide range of medicines and treatments which are too complex to mention here.</P>
      <P>This young lady has lived in St. Mary's Hospital, Drumcar, County Louth, for the past ten and a half years. She had a unit for herself which she knows as her home and a nursing staff to care for her. She has been well and happy for the past ten and half years in St. Mary's.</P>
      <P>In March of this year Melissa went into Crumlin hospital for tests and while she was in Crumlin she became very ill, leading to her being on life support for two weeks. Her staff from St. Mary's, Drumcar, accompanied Melissa while she was in hospital, to care for her.</P>
      <P>While Melissa was in Crumlin hospital, her unit in St. Mary's Drumcar was redecorated and a new bathroom installed for her return. Two days after Melissa came out of life support, her staff were withdrawn from her care and her crisis care unit was closed down. Her family were told that her home would not be reopening. This has been a devastating blow to this very ill 16 year old.</P>
      <P>On Melissa's return to Drumcar she was placed in a completely unsuitable place for her very acute medical needs. Her medical condition and mental state are now critical. Melissa's family are distraught to find her home has been taken from her. All she wants to know is when she is going back to the unit she loves and knows so well.</P>
      <P>Where are the rights of the child in this case? Will the Minister of State outline them here or will the courts, once again, have to establish them? How could someone make a decision which would adversely affect a child like Melissa so much? Will it have to take another tragedy of a 16 year old girl for lessons to be learned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> Melissa was left in the care of agency nurses who did not know her special needs or how to care for her. She ended up on life support once again in the Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. She has a complex medical condition which includes low temperature control. Her previous home, which was a crisis care unit, which is only about 70 feet from where she is now, was adapted to suit her every need.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, as does her family, urgently to reinstate Melissa in her home in the crisis care unit in St. Mary's, Drumcar. We are looking at a life and death situation. Why can Melissa not be left to live out whatever short life she has in her home in the crisis care unit, safely and with some contentment in the low quality of life which for any person is a huge and disproportionate burden, and particularly for Melissa and her family, to bear?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Sargent for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The young person concerned has very particular and unique medical needs. Because of her particular needs, and also because of the concerns her parents have for their daughter's well being, the plans for her care must be dealt with in a very sensitive manner. I am aware that the person concerned required recent emergency admission to an acute hospital and that on her return was accommodated within a different unit. This decision was taken in order to provide for her particular needs and also the requirements of the service providers. The move from her present services to new services provided by the Northern Area Health Board is being made to provide for her long-term needs. To this end, the board has been in regular communication with her family and have had regular meetings with her current service providers over the last number of months. Updated medical histories have been requested from the consultants who have been involved in her treatment.</P>
      <P>The Northern Area Health Board had proposed to transfer this young person from her current residence to a high support hostel. However, because of several acute medical emergencies over the last number of months, necessitating her admission to hospital, the board has decided to alter its care arrangements and arrange for her transfer to St. Ita's Hospital. The board is currently developing a special unit for her at the hospital. This unit will equal the standard of the facilities the patient has enjoyed up to now. Arrangements are in place for the board's staff to be trained to equip them for their future roles in providing a service for this young person. This training will be provided to medical, nursing and care staff as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a meeting took place yesterday between the girl's parents and the clinical personnel who will be caring for her from 1 September 2001, at St. Ita's Hospital. The meeting <Col N="825" /> provided an opportunity for the family to discuss in detail with the relevant clinical personnel the board's plan for the person's care both prior to and following her admission to St. Ita's later this year.</P>
    <P>It is planned to hold a further meeting with the family within the first two weeks of August and in the interim, the family was advised that they could contact the clinicians who were present at the meeting should they wish to discuss any matter in relation to this girl's future care.</P>
    <P>I have been assured that the Northern Area Health Board is committed to ensuring that the needs of the young person concerned will be met and every effort made to provide her with the highest quality of life possible. Officials of the Department of Health and Children have been and will continue to liaise with the Northern Area Health Board in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Irish Examiner </i>today published a report which stated that 20 patients requiring blood have received blood supplied by three donors who were subsequently diagnosed as having classical CJD. While health experts may say that there is no cause for alarm, and the indications are that the deadly brain disease cannot be contracted through blood transfusion, there is no scientific certainty of this so we cannot be complacent.</P>
      <P>The Irish Blood Transfusion Service when contacted confirmed the story and has also confirmed that the blood transfusion service doctors were contacting the GPs of the individuals concerned and that the persons affected will be informed eventually. However, I would submit that there is no guarantee that the patient will be told. It is at the discretion of the individual GP and I am questioning the principle of the right to know.</P>
      <P>Scientific studies undertaken to date show that classical CJD can be spread through organ donation, surgery and blood transfusions, but unlike variant CJD, is not contracted by eating BSE infected beef, even though the effects of both diseases are similar. This issue is of major public interest and the explanation given by the IBTS spokesperson that the facts had not been made public on the grounds that they were contacting the recipients' doctors, is unacceptable in view of the scandals that have occurred to date and which are the subject of the Lindsay tribunal hearing. Have any lessons been learned from the past? Surely the IBTS has a responsibility to contact the affected persons directly rather than using a third party. It has some questions to answer on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking if the Minister is aware of this issue; when did he become aware; why was the public not informed and, more importantly, why were the patients concerned not informed directly? The worst health scandals in the history of the State have been caused by appalling mistakes in the use of blood and its products by <Col N="826" /> official agencies. I call on the Minister to make a full and frank statement and I demand that he carry out a full inquiry into the whole affair.</P>
    <P>Since this matter is just one of a long series of incidents involving the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, I am also asking the Minister why he is suppressing the Philip Flynn report on the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. In response to a parliamentary question which I submitted to him last Tuesday, the Minister said that the report had been available to individuals within the IBTS and he welcomed the commitment given by that body that it would implement the recommendations in that report. This is a suppression of the facts. It is essential that the Flynn report be made public because we are being subjected daily to a series of selective leaks. The editorial in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>stated this morning that bad blood memories will not be dispelled with words. When it comes to possible links between CJD and blood, the only certainty is that there are no certainties.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the full facts be disclosed by the Minister and that a detailed explanation be given by him. A commitment to a full inquiry into this latest incident and the full publication of the Flynn report is required. Anything short of this will demonstrate serious political negligence on the part of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for raising this issue on the Adjournment. CJD, which is also referred to as classical or sporadic CJD, is a rare disease affecting approximately one person per million per year worldwide. In general, the majority of cases arise spontaneously. However, much less commonly, cases can result from exposure to infectious material. The international scientific evidence available to date indicates that CJD is not transmissible through blood or blood products.</P>
      <P>There are around three cases of CJD per year in Ireland. CJD mainly affects older people and the average age of onset is 65 years of age. The typical duration of the illness is only a matter of months, and the clinical hallmarks are rapid progression of dementia together with a loss of control of movement. CJD has been a notifiable disease in this country since November 1996. A national surveillance system has been established and is based at Beaumont Hospital. Cases of clinically suspected CJD are referred to the hospital for further pathological diagnosis.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is to permanently defer potential donors who may be at risk of carrying CJD, including persons who have received a <i>dura mater</i> transplant, human pituitary-derived growth hormone, or who have one or more blood relatives with CJD. It is important to note that in the matter raised by the Deputy, the donors in question were diagnosed with classical CJD and not variant CJD. An appreciation of the distinction between these two conditions is essential to understand the actions taken by the IBTS in the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> There is no proven instance of classical CJD having been transmitted through blood or blood products. With regard to variant CJD on the other hand, the theoretical possibility of transmission cannot be excluded at this time. As a result, the IBTS has implemented a number of precautionary measures to protect against this theoretical risk. Experimental animal models suggest that the infectivity may be associated with white blood cells in animal systems. White blood cells can be removed from blood donations using special filters, by a process called leucodepletion, and the IBTS, as a precautionary measure, introduced leucodepletion for cellular products in 1999. In addition, the IBTS has recently commenced to defer donors who resided in the UK during the period 1980 to 1986 on a phased basis, to further address concerns about the possible risk of transmission of variant CJD by blood transfusion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised by the Deputy, there is no question that the IBTS failed to disclose that donations were transfused from patients who later went on to develop CJD. The question of informing recipients is not an easy one and must be considered in the light of the international evidence that the condition is not transmissible through blood transfusion. In the US, the Food and Drugs Administration advises informing &ldquo;the physician or other qualified personnel responsible for the care of the recipient so that recipient tracing and medically appropriate notification and counselling may be performed at the discretion of care provider&rdquo;. In both the UK and Australia, my understanding is that recipients of donations from donors who later develop CJD are not informed, precisely because of the absence of risk.</P>
    <P>In December 2000, the CJD advisory group, on which the IBTS is represented, considered the issue of a look-back programme on the previous donations of donors who were subsequently diagnosed with CJD. After a detailed discussion on the matter and taking into account the extremely low risks, if any, associated with such donations, the group agreed with the IBTS policy of contacting the treating doctors and informing them of the situation. It was agreed that the final decision as to whether to inform the recipient was to be left with the individual clinician.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The CJD advisory group also decided to commission a study by the Royal College of Surgeons on the psychological impact of informing recipients who received donations from donors who later developed any form of CJD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of informing recipients of donations from classical CJD donors has also been carefully considered by the American Red Cross committee for the Prevention of Human Subjects, who strongly discourage the sharing of this information. The basis for their advice is: evi<Col N="828" /> dence showing the absence of risk of transmission classical CJD through blood components; the inevitable stress which is likely to result from such disclosure; and the absence of any test or treatment which would help to alleviate this stress.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that the most important of these reasons is the absence of risk of transmission. This is also the international consensus of advice on this matter and the advice of the CJD advisory group.</P>
    <P>As a result of the IBTS's look-back programme, three blood donors have been identified who were subsequently diagnosed with classical CJD. As part of the look-back programme the IBTS wrote to the clinicians involved, and found that 20 recipients received the donations of these apparently healthy donors. As explained the decision whether to inform the recipient rests with the clinician, in view of the negligible risk involved.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has informed me that he has requested a full report on the current position regarding the look-back programme from both the IBTS and the CJD advisory committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second matter raised by the Deputy, the report referred to is entitled Recommendations to the Board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service on the Implementation of the Reorganisation plan, and was prepared by management consultants at the request of the board of the IBTS. The Minister understands that at a special meeting of the board held on 23 June 2001, the board accepted the consultants' recommendations. The Minister also understands that the board is arranging to make copies of the report available to relevant staff in the organisation. The board is also commencing the implementation of the recommendations within the best principles and practices of change management, involving all staff in the consultative process.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch den Cheann Comhairle as seans a fháil an t-ábhar seo a ardú. Timpeall 20 bliain ó shin chuir duine ón Cheathrú Rua sampla den uisce isteach go dtí Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe le haghaidh ainilíse.</P>
      <P>Sé mhí i ndiaidh sin fuair sé freagra i mBéarla go raibh an t-uisce &ldquo;potable&rdquo;. Sin an caighdeán is ísle i leith uisce is féidir a úsáid. Suas le scór bliain i ndiaidh sin &ndash; inné &ndash; tháinig níos mó ná 50 duine suas go Teach Laighean. Chuir siad turas 320 míle orthu chun aird a tharraingt ar an ndrochchaoi atá fós ar chóras uisce agus séarachais na Ceathrú Rua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé glactha ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe i bPlean Forbartha an Chontae agus tá sé glactha ag Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an Cheathrú Rua mar ionad a bhfuil cumas forbartha ann. Is féidir iar<Col N="829" /> rachtaí a dhéanamh an ceantar a phleanáil i gceart. Tá daonra mór ann agus tagann na mílte cuairteoirí ann, go háirithe sa samhradh. Baineann a lán acu sin le cúrsaí Gaeilge &ndash; daltaí ina measc. Tá siad san ag brath ar an chóras uisce. Tá gnáthmhuintir na háite ag brath ar an chóras uisce ach ag an bpointe seo is é an t-aon rogha atá acu ná uisce a cheannach nó dul soir chomh fada le Ros a'Mhíl chun uisce glan a fháil leis na nithe is bunúsaí a chríochnú.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, rud eile atá tábhachtach, níl aon phlean ann chun feabhas bunúsach a dhéanamh ar an cheist go dtí an bhliain 2007. Níl sé luaite sa phlean séarachais don Ghaeltacht 2000 &ndash; 2006.  Chomh maith leis sin níl ach leasú gearr-thréimhseach á ofráil do mhuintir na h-áite. Mar is gnách d'fhógair an tAire Stáit Éamon Ó Cuív inné &ndash; agus d'fhógair sé an rud ceanann céanna arís is arís eile &ndash;  go mbeadh £190m punt ar fáil. D'fhógair sé é sin cúpla mí ó shin ach rinne sé arís é inné. Ní bheidh aon tairbhe le fáil ag muintir na Ceathrú Rua as sin i ndáiríre mar is straitéis ghearr-thréimhseach é. An rud atá tábhachtach ná córas ceart a chur in áit.  In a dhiaidh sin, rud eile atá tábhachtach, b'fhéidir, ná go mbeadh scéimeanna ar gach taobh den Cheathrú Rua, cuid acu ceadaithe ag an bpointe seo. Ach tá muintir na Ceathrú Rua agus na limistéar mór thimpeall fágtha ar láimh.</P>
    <P>Ag an bpointe seo níl aon rud éilithe ag mo chomhleacaithe eile ach go socrófaí cruinniú eatorra féin agus an tAire Comhshaoil. An cheist atá agam ná má tharlaíonn sé go mbeidh an cruinniú seo ann an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Roinn iarraidh ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe an plean atá acu go dtí 2006 a athrú i dtreo is gur féidir leis an chomhairle chontae airgead a chaitheamh ar an scéim nua i rith an tréimhse sin? An bhfuil aon athrú ag teacht ar sin? Chomh maith leis sin an mbeidh an t-airgead atá riachtanach ar fáil chun scéim cheart a chur in áit?</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé i dtosach is 20 bliain ó shin a rinneadh iarracht aird Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe a dhíriú ar chomh dona is atá an scéal. Tar éis scór bliain ba chóir nach mbeadh ar mhuintir na Ceathrú Rua fanacht go ceann deich mbliana eile chun go mbeadh an rud is bunúsaí ar fad &ndash; sé sin uisce glan &ndash; a bheith acu dóibh féin agus do na cuairteoirí a thagann i rith an tsamhraidh agus i rith na bliana ar fad. I ndáiríre, is áit í ina bhailíonn gnáthmhuintir na Gaeilge gach deireadh seachtaine. Tá tábhacht agus práinn ag baint leis an cheist seo.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom a rá go n-aontaím go hiomlán le gach rud a dúirt an Teachta Ó hUiginn faoin chaoi in a bhfuil rudaí maidir le huisce agus séarachas sa Cheathrú Rua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé i gceist infheistíocht £3 bhilliún in iomlán a chur ar fáil do sheirbhísí uisce agus séarachais ar feadh tréimhse an Phlean Fhorbartha Náisiúnta 2000 go 2006. As an méid sin, tá £2.4 bhilliún sonraithe do mhórscéimeanna poiblí. Tá an <Col N="830" /> infheistíocht seo dírithe ar na seirbhísí uisce agus uisce dramhaoile is gá a chur ar fáil chun tacú leis an bhforbairt eacnamaíoch agus sóisialta, le táirgeadh na fostaíochta, le cothú na rátaí borrtha arda agus le caighdeáin arda timpeallachta a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Fógraíodh Clár nua Infheistíochta do Sheirbhísí Uisce i mí Iúil seo caite i leith na tréimhse 2000 go dtí 2002. Tá 529 scéim sa chlár, le luach £2.1 bhilliún san iomlán. Roghhaíodh na scéimeanna sa chlár ó mheasúnaithe a rinne na húdaráis áitiúla ar a riachtanaisí, rud a chríochnaigh siad sa bhliain 1999. Tá sé sin curtha go dtí an Roinn ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe. B'í príomh-aidhm na measúnaithe siúd ná plean straitéiseach infheistíochta don mheántéarma agus don fhadtéarma a fhorbairt do gach Contae, agus clár oibreacha a leagan amach chun freastal ar na riachtanais a sonraíodh.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom é gur bhain Gaillimh tairbhe suntasach as an gClár do 2000 go 2002. Tá 30 scéim i gceist, ar luach thar £180 milliún, don chathair agus don chontae. Tá maoiniú curtha ar fáil freisin faoi Thionscnamh an Talaimh Dheisithe chun láithreáin chónaithe deisithe breise a chur ar fáil a luaithe is féidir é chun freastal ar riachtanais tithíochta in áiteanna éagsúla ar fud an chontae. Gach rud san áireamh, is léir go bhfuil Gaillimh ag fáil a chion cóir den mhaoiniú atá ann agus go gcuirfidh na scéimeanna atá ceadaithe go mór le constaicí ar an bhforbairt a bhaint as an mbealach agus leis an bonneagar riachtanach a chruthú chun tacú leis an ngníomhaíocht turasóireachta, gnó, tionsclaíoch agus tithíochta sa chontae agus í a mhéadú.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Scéim Soláthar Uisce na Ceathrú Rua, áiríodh Scéim Uisce Réigiúnach Dheisceart Chonamara (a chuimsíonn togra do scéim soláthair uisce don Cheathrú Rua san) mar thosaíocht íseal ar liosta na scéimeanna ar ghlac Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe leis mar fhreagra ar iarratas ó mo Roinn-se ar gach údarás áitiúil measúnú úr a dhéanamh ar na riachtanais maidir le oibreacha caipitiúil agus tosaíochtaí a dtograí a chinneadh ar bhonn an mheasúnaithe sin.</P>
    <P>De réir mar atá luaite agam cheana féin, cuireadh na liostaí tosaíochta sin san áireamh agus an Clár Infheistíochta do Sheirbhísí Uisce 2000-2002 á chur in eagar. De bharr na tosaíochta ísle a cheap an Chomhairle don scéim, chomh maith le leibhéal na hiomaíochta san éileamh, agus toisc gur ghá tosaíochtaí gach togra faoi leith a chinneadh go náisiúnta go tograí faoi leith, níorbh fhéidir é a chuimsiú sa Chlár Infheistíochta do Sheirbhísí Uisce 2000 &ndash; 2002 a fógraíodh i mí Iúil seo caite. I liosta leasaithe tosaíochtaí a chuir Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe faoi bhráid mo Roinne i mí Eanáir na bliana seo, cuireadh Scéim Réigiúnach Uisce Chonamara Theas sa tríú háit ar liosna na scéimeanna uisce agus cuireadh Scéim Séarachais na Ceathrú Rua sa chúigiú háit ar liosta na scéimeanna séarachais. Is é an clár trí bliana do 2000 go 2002 an chéad chéim <Col N="831" /> i gclár leanúnach a leanfaidh go deireadh an Phlean Fhorbartha Náisiúnta sa bhliain 2006.</P>
    <P>Cuirfear a thuilleadh scéimeanna leis gach bliain i rith na tréimhse sin. Déanfar machnamh arís ar scéimeanna na Ceathrú Rua, mar sin, agus an chéad bhabhta eile do thionscadail á gcur leis an gClár. Tuigtear dom, áfach, go bhfuil sé i gceist ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe idir an dá linn £190,000 a chaitheamh i rith na bliana atá ag teacht nó mar sin ar oibreacha deisiúcháin ar na scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais araon ar an gCeathrú Rua. Tá páirtmhaoiniú ag dul don obair seo ó Chlár Uisce Tuaithe mo Roinne agus is cóir <Col N="832" /> go maolfaidh sin na fadhbanna is crúógaí atá ag an dá scéim.</P>
    <P>Tá mé tar éis éisteacht go cúramach lena raibh le rá ag an Teachta agus a dúirt an toscaireacht a tháinig go Teach Laighean inné. Ní raibh mé féin in ann casadh leo mar bhí mé gafa le gnó eile ag an am. Is féidir leo a bheith cinnte go dtabharfar aire iomlán do chás na Ceathrú Rua nuair a bheidh ceist na scéimeanna breise á ghlacadh agus á scrúdú. Déanfaidh mé féin a chinntiú go mbeidh tús áite ag an scéim nuair a bheidh an liosta nua á cheadú.</P>

      <P>I initiated a broad public consultation process in relation to the development of the plan and some 350 submissions were received and assessed. Parallel preparatory work and consultation was undertaken within my Department involving an assessment of the current management of our heritage. The draft plan was circulated to Departments on a consultative basis and their reactions to proposals have been considered. The drafting of the plan is being finalised within my Department and, I hope, after obtaining Government approval, to publish it later this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There were no substantive discussions on the issue of public service broadcasting. The matter was on the agenda to enable an oral communication from the Commission to the Council. The <Col N="834" /> Commission's briefing consisted mainly of informing the Council that a first draft of a Commission communication on the application of state aid rules to public service broadcasting had been recently circulated. The Commission is attempting to put in place a set of principles that it will use in its investigation of complaints of illegal state aids to public service broadcasters. There was no discussion on the topic.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to quantify the numbers of sites where archaeological excavations have taken place since the foundation of the State. As the Deputy may already be aware, archaeological investigations and excavations must be licensed by my Department. So far this year, a total of 637 excavation licences have been issued, most of which relate to planning and development. It is likely that the number of licences issued by the end of this year will exceed 1,000.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently advertised for tenders for archaeological investigative excavations at two national monuments, Kindlestown Castle in County Wicklow and Jigginstown House, County Kildare. Research excavations, which form a very small proportion of excavations carried out annually, are traditionally undertaken by academic archaeologists during summer vacations. Eight such licenses issued last year but so far, none have been issued in respect of this year.</P>

      <P>There is a very large amount of knowledge about salmon in Ireland, <Col N="836" /> but more limited hard scientific data on salmon population numbers. In evaluating sites for proposal as special areas of conservation for salmon under the EU Habitats Directive, my Department, having consulted widely in the matter, and particularly with the central and regional fisheries boards, has used the best information available under the following headings: sites of importance because of the size of the salmon population; sites important for spring salmon, which are genetically distinct and more threatened; good geographic range, that is, rivers from around Ireland; reasonable prospects regarding water quality and physical condition; and, where appropriate, significant presence in sites of other habitats or species listed under the Habitats Directive. I am satisfied that this has resulted in extensive information on salmon distribution and abundance being brought to bear on the selection of rivers to be proposed as SACs for salmon. On the basis of this information it has been concluded that the River Liffey does not meet the required standard. I do not, therefore, intend to propose it for designation as a special area of conservation.</P>

      <P>Illnacullin Glengarriff, County Cork, more commonly known as Garnish Island, was bequeathed to the State in 1953 and I am happy to confirm it is one of the premier heritage properties managed by my Department. As such, my Department has invested considerably in the maintenance and development of the island over the years including restoration of the Casita and Pavilion in the Italian Garden and the provision of enhanced visitor facilities, in particular the provision of tearooms. Plans are currently in hand for upgrading paths and steps in addition to the ongoing programme of maintenance of the plant collections and grounds. The Deputy can rest assured that my Department continues to actively monitor the position and will implement further improvements as may be considered warranted, for example, improvements to the slipway, the Martello tower and staff facilities, subject of course to financial resources being available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss to know what is the promised major development programme to which the Deputy is referring. However, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that in essence, with the exception of the caretaker's residence which is a longer term proposal, all major development proposals have already been implemented. In the management and development of the tourism potential <Col N="837" /> of this premier heritage property it has to be recognised that the overriding consideration for my Department is one of conservation of the historical integrity and fragile physical environment together with the peaceful and secluded atmosphere of these wonderful Gardens which owe their existence to the creative partnership in the early 1900s of Annan Bryce, then owner of the island and Harold Peto, architect and garden designer.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the deputy that the BBC Gardeners World have just completed filming in Garnish for a one hour programme, &ldquo;Gardening on the Edge&rdquo;, to be screened on 18 July. This is the only Irish garden to feature along with six or seven other leading gardens in Scotland, Wales and England.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 351 of 26 June 2001 in which I gave details of the meetings of the Council of Ministers since July 1997 and the attendance for each meeting. There have been ten formal meetings of the EU Council of Ministers since June 1997. Of these, I attended the meetings on 24 November 1997, 17 November 1998, 23 November 2000 and 21 June 2001. The critical decisions in relation to culture and audio-visual matters were taken at these meetings. For example, the main political debate on the single framework for culture &ndash; Culture 2000 &ndash; and the decision on the European capital of culture event for the period 2005 to 2019 took place at the Council meeting on 17 November 1998.</P>
      <P>The most important decision concerning the European audio-visual industry &ndash; the adoption of the Media Plus programme &ndash; was taken at the meeting on 23 November 2000. I was involved in the political discussion around this proposal. At the meeting on 21 June 2001 the most important issue from my perspective was the Commission announcement of its intention to explore certain legal aspects in relation to the audio-visual industry. I took part in the discussion following the Commission announcement and my views were echoed by the other member states. I was represented at all other formal meetings by Ireland's deputy permanent representative to the European Union.</P>

      <P>Section 2(2) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1956, empowers the Government to determine by order that specified areas, which are substantially Irish speaking areas and areas contiguous thereto, ought to be included in the Gaeltacht with a view to preserving and extending the use of Irish as a vernacular language. The Government established An Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht last year to make recommendations with regard to the strengthening of the Irish language as the everyday language of the people of the Gaeltacht. The commission was charged with, among other issues, the preparation of recommendations regarding the linguistic criteria to be used in the determination of Gaeltacht areas including the devising of a system whereby those areas might be added to or subtracted from.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, while it is open to the people of an area, if they so wish, to apply at any time for the area in question to be determined a Gaeltacht area, decisions are not being made on applications for inclusion of areas in the Gaeltacht pending receipt of the commission's recommendations and consideration thereof. I expect the commission's report to be available before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is in the process of preparing a national biodiversity action plan that is now at an advanced stage. The preparation of the plan involved an extended formal public consultation process, to which many organisations and individuals responded. Also, officials of my Department met with key NGOs in January and explained in considerable detail the format and general approach of the draft plan. In addition, when the plan is published the NGOs will be invited to participate in the ongoing monitoring and review which is an integral part of the plan. I am anxious to have the plan published and adopted as policy at the earliest possible date and it is my intention to seek Government approval for its publication in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister responsible for the arts, I would be extremely reluctant to describe myself as being fully satisfied with the development of the arts, lest this imply that there is no room for improvement or further development in this very important area of our national life. However, I am satisfied that the position is now very much better than when I took office. I secured funding of £100 million for the Arts Council in the context of the current three year arts plan. This represents a very major increase on previous levels of provision.</P>
      <P>I have also undertaken a review of the existing arts legislation with a view to determining the principles and issues that need to be addressed in any new legislation to reflect the way we develop, support and understand the arts. In July 2000 I published a discussion document, Towards a new Framework for the Arts, which set out in broad terms many of the issues to be addressed concerning the arts in today's environment. I invited the arts sector to respond to this document and over 230 submissions were received.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a consultation seminar was held in May this year in the course of which over 30 key players in the arts sector were brought together in focus groups to consider in detail the issues arising in the context of the legislative review and which had been brought to the fore in the submissions received. The outcome of their discussions were presented to and discussed by a plenary session to which were invited all of the 230 plus parties who had made submissions. Other interested individuals and organisations were also invited to this plenary session.</P>
      <P>The views and outcomes that have emerged from this consultation process have informed my proposals that have been approved by Government for the drafting of a new Arts Bill and I am currently having discussions with the Attorney General with regard to the timetable for publishing the new Bill. In May of this year I announced the establishment, in co-operation with IBEC, of the Music Board of Ireland. During its first year, the board is charged to formulate a strategic plan for the development of the Irish music industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 2000 I announced a new scheme <Col N="842" /> known as the arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, which will have funding of £36 million available to approved projects over the period 2001-04. ACCESS will primarily assist the development of arts and culture infrastructure and in particular integrated arts centres, theatres, museums and galleries as well as art studios and other arts production, creative and theatre spaces. The programme will have three distinct strands as follows: new facilities at regional, county and city level; the redevelopment of existing arts and culture facilities and venues including new build, additional build or major refurbishment; and smaller community based projects.</P>
    <P>Applications for the above scheme have been received and the independent committee I established to examine applications has completed its work. I will shortly be in a position to announce which projects can be given approval in principle, subject to relevant conditions being satisfied. Significant infrastructural developments have been brought forward for the national cultural institutions. Since early 1998 major works have been undertaken or are at an advanced planning stage in all of the institutions coming within my remit. These projects include the £16 million development of the millennium wing for the National Gallery of Ireland. Thus, the gallery will be able to develop its conservation facilities, gain much need exhibition space, enhance the visitor experience and generally provide an improved service for its visitor and staff alike.</P>
    <P>Last year the newly refurbished and converted Clock Tower building at Dublin Castle was opened for the Chester Beatty Library, thus transferring this priceless and unique collection from its former home in Shewsbury Road, to its new prestigious and central location in the heart of Dublin. This move will secure for future generations this magnificent storehouse of artefacts from different cultures and times. The library will be enabled in its new abode to ensure the conservation of, accessibility to, and enjoyment for, the thousands of visitors who come to this historical part of the city annually of its material, much of which has not been on public display to date.</P>
    <P>Contemporary art has not been neglected and a new facility at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham has been opened. This project involved the refurbishment of a building known as the Deputy Master's House for additional exhibition space and administration use and involved an investment of in excess of £2 million, part funded from EU funds. Work to the new facility for the National Museum at Collins Barracks is ongoing. Expenditure of the £18 million in EU and Exchequer funds allocated to this project under the EU programme has been achieved in the period 1994 to 1999 and the next phases are now in development. This will primarily relate to the construction of a new building at the centre of the site which will unite the whole complex and give a much-needed focus to the project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> Development for the National Museum of Ireland has not been confined to Dublin, however. An exciting project is nearing completion in Castlebar, County Mayo. With the assistance of Mayo County Council, which has shown considerable vision and enthusiasm, and with EU support, the folklife collection of the museum will be housed in new exhibition spaces to be developed at Turlough Park House just outside Castlebar at a cost of approximately £9 million. Work on this splendid project is well advanced and it is envisaged the new facility it will be ready for opening this autumn. I am confident that owing to the strategic position of Turlough Park house that very significant regional and economic benefits, principally through tourism, will accrue from the presence of this prestigious museum facility.</P>
    <P>The National Library of Ireland has also seen the benefits of capital funds with the ongoing refurbishment works under way throughout its premises on Kildare Street. A phased plan costed at £50 million is being implemented to bring about considerable and much needed improvements not only for the collections, but for the staff and most importantly for the present and potential users of this most precious institution. A major redevelopment of the former National College of Art and Design building adjoining the library is just completed and will provide the library with improved staff facilities and collection management resources in the short term.</P>
    <P>In relation to the National Archives, discussions I have had with my colleague the Minister for Finance have resulted in sanction to proceed with a major redevelopment scheme for the archives and the examination of the project as a potential public private partnership &ndash; PPP. An initial order of cost for the project is £45 million. This development will meet the staffing and user and storage needs of this vital institution well in the future.</P>
    <P>The significant progress for the national cultural institutions on the capital investment side has been matched elsewhere. I made no secret of my belief that the annual funding provided for our national cultural institutions was inadequate. Since assuming office I have provided substantial additional resources for the national cultural institutions in each year. This year I am particularly pleased to report that amount of funding available for our national cultural institutions, their acquisition programme and cultural projects under subheads C1, C2 and C4 will total £16.128 million, the largest amount ever. This includes £3 million to commence the new heritage fund. This fund when established under statute later this year will finance the national cultural institutions acquisition of works of art, artefacts or collections that are beyond their normal financial resources and certainly could not even have been considered in the past. It will be a very powerful resource and will enabling the national insti<Col N="844" /> tutions acquire important examples of our patrimony for the nation.</P>
    <P>Subhead C1 of my Department's Vote provides grant-in-aid for the main cultural institutions. The cultural institutions include the National Museum of Ireland, the National Library, the National Archives, the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Chester Beatty Library and the National Archives Advisory Council. I was pleased to be in a position to secure funding of £9.905 million in the subhead C1 allocation in 2001 and this has facilitated increases in the 2001 allocations to each of these cultural institutions. The 2001 allocations under subhead C1 include additional capital funding to facilitate the national cultural institutions in developing their collections through the acquisition of appropriate materials and artefacts.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that a significant increase, from £0.682 million in 2000 to £0.747 million in 2001, was possible in the case of the National Archives. The allocation will facilitate the National Archives to continue its conservation programme in partnership with Marsh's Library. Funding in relation to the National Concert Hall has also increased from £0.820 million to £0.940 million. This increase will facilitate staffing costs and the continuation of the National Concert Hall's very worthwhile education and outreach programme.</P>
    <P>The subhead C2 current allocations are in respect of allocations from Exchequer funds to a number of small cultural projects and bodies. These include the Irish Manuscripts Commission, Marsh's Library, the Irish Architectural Archive, Hunt Museum etc. I am also pleased to mention an increase from £0.107 million to £0.200 million respect of Marsh's Library. This will facilitate the holding of a number of events and activities to mark the tercentenary of the foundation of the Library in 1701.</P>
    <P>In the case of Vote 43 for the National Gallery, the 2001 allocation shows an increase of 234% over the 2000 Vote. This significant increase in the gallery's Vote is accounted for in large measure by a substantial increase in the budget for the purchase of paintings as well as the increase in salaries, wages and allowances. This provision reflects the Government's contribution towards the completion of the major extension to the National Gallery, the millennium wing on Clare Street, which was also in receipt of EU Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>The funding available to my Department in respect of the built heritage in 2001 is £33.561 million. This allows my Department to carry out its remit with regard to the continued protection of national monuments and historic properties in State care, the promotion and presentation of sites with visitor facilities and at the same time to accelerate work on very necessary architectural and archaeological surveys so that planners and developers can be better informed before making project decisions. In addition, under the national development plan my Department has embarked on a major capital works programme which will see major restoration work being undertaken at over 100 of the almost 750 properties in state care in the period to 2006. The funding which is available to my Department is earmarked primarily for the built heritage in State care. The Heritage Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government provide funding for grants schemes aimed at properties not in the care of the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue which has been referred to in the report of the National Archives Advisory Council was that of accommodation. Deputies will recall the £13 million expansion scheme for the National Archives which I launched in December 1997. This development was planned to address one issue in particular for the National Archives which was the long-term storage needs. Following a report by consultants on the scope of the requirements for the adaptation and extension of the existing facilities, design proposals which had been prepared were extended to encompass the full range of activities in the National Archives and not just storage. This plan envisaged a much larger building with new road frontage and pro<Col N="846" /> viding greater on-site storage and office facilities, reading and public spaces.</P>

      <P>I understand that life assurance policies were sold by a number of companies that included a review clause. The advantage of these policies from the point of view of the consumer was that they permitted renewal of life cover after a stated period without a medical test. However, the rates to be charged would reflect the fact that the policyholder was now older than when the policy was first taken out. The policies were also designed to provide cover at a very economical rate in the early years, when policyholders generally have higher expenses, with the cost of cover increasing when policyholders were older and better able to afford higher cover.</P>

      <P>According to the latest Quarterly National Household Survey, there are 65,600 people unemployed or 3.7% of the labour force. The long-term unemployed account for 21,500, 1.2%, of this total. There is a range of measures in place designed to ensure that unemployed and marginalised people are given the opportunity to take up paid work.</P>
      <P>FÁS engages with persons on the live register as they cross a certain period of unemployment with a view to preventing their becoming long-term unemployed. Persons are referred by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and are offered a job, training or other support. To date 51,425 people have been referred and 67% have signed off the live register.</P>
      <P>The national employment service, including the services at local level, are designed to provide individual supports to persons who are severely disadvantaged in labour market terms. The local employment service has more than 15,000 clients at present. A number of active labour market programmes, designed to give unemployed and marginalised people the necessary work experience, training or incentive to progress to the labour market, are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS programmes, such as community employment and the job initiative programme are tar<Col N="848" /> geted at the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged persons. These programmes provide work experience for participants and valuable opportunities for personal development and training. The primary purpose of such programmes is to reintegrate participants into work in the open labour market. There are currently some 32,000 places on CE. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, this is expected to reduce to 28,000 by 2003. Other programmes include the back-to-work allowance, operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, with approximately 40,000 participants and vocational training opportunities scheme, operated by the Department of Education and Science, with more than 5000 places.</P>
    <P>I recently launched the social economy programme which will support enterprises in providing social services for disadvantaged communities and, in so doing, will provide full-time jobs for people who are three years long-term unemployed and over 35 years of age. Other marginalised groups are also eligible. Some 2,500 jobs are expected to be created by 2003. In addition, FÁS provides a range of courses, such as return to work, specific skills training, or enterprise training, to help integrate disadvantaged people into the open labour market. FÁS provided training to approximately 30,000 people in 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department has made a number of commitments in the PPF to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. These focus on skills development to facilitate the progression of people with disabilities into sustainable employment, the development of specific employment programmes targeted at people with disabilities and improved employment supports for both people with disabilities and employers. Also, as identified in the PPF, some job seekers may have difficulties in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market due to age and other personal barriers such as health, literacy and numeracy factors. Appropriate long-term supports are needed for people experiencing employment barriers of this nature. My Department is finalising proposals for a high supports process, which will enhance the range of options available for persons with employment barriers. Further consultations with the social partners on the high supports process are due to take place shortly with a view to implementation at an early date.</P>

      <P>The Minister and I have been following closely developments in relation to Independent Insurance Company Limited, ICL a UK insurer which went into voluntary liquidation on 18 June, with particular focus on the immediate implications for Irish policyholders and claimants. We are also concerned at the broader implications for the effective operation of the European Single Market in insurance. Contact is being maintained with the UK authorities and with the EU Commission, as well as with the provisional liquidators, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Irish Brokers Association.</P>
      <P>Under the rules of the European Single Market, responsibility for financial supervision of the company's operations throughout the European Economic Area, EEA, lies with the UK authorities. The main objective of the EU system of financial supervision of insurance companies is to protect policyholders while giving them access to insurance cover from supervised companies in all EEA member states.</P>
      <P>The treatment of policyholders as creditors of a failed insurer is determined by the laws of the home member state, in this case, the United Kingdom. UK insolvency law treats all policyholders as unsecured creditors. It will not be clear for some time the extent to which the liquidators of IICL will be able to meet claims from the creditors of IICL, including policyholders. It appears likely that claims will not be met in full. The UK Policyholder Protection Act provides, subject to certain limitations, that compensation be paid to individual policyholders in the event of a company failure. Corporate policyholders are compensated only in respect of compulsory insurance. Our officials are seeking to clarify whether any policies issued to Irish policyholders will meet the qualifying criteria for protection.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the underwriting of insurance risks and setting of premiums are matters for judgment by individual private insurance companies. It should be remembered that these are issues upon which insurance companies make decisions and EU law prevents us from having any direct function in relation to them. Insurance companies are <Col N="850" /> not required to seek approval from this Department for price increases. Prior approval or systematic notification of scales of premiums is prohibited by domestic insurance legislation, SI 359 of 1994, which gives effect to the third Non-Life Insurance Framework Directive.

      <P>The most effective way of ensuring the changeover to the euro does not lead to an increase in prices is to empower consumers to be vigilant in monitoring prices. This is the objective of dual display of prices. Dual display helps consumers to familiarise themselves with the new currency and enables them to build up a scale of values in euros so that they can be confident in making purchases in the new currency. The key initiative to encourage dual display of prices has been the development of the national code on euro changeover.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has contacted over 200 trade associations, inviting them to sign up to the national code on behalf of their members, or to draw up a sectoral code of their own and seek her approval for it. To date, a total of 11 trade associations and 17 individual companies have signed up to the code. The director's office is in the process of responding to applications from close on 100 further potential subscribers to the code by individual companies. The director has approved four sectoral codes submitted to her by IBEC-EAN &ndash; subscribers include all of the major supermarkets and retail chains &ndash; the Irish Petroleum Industry Association, Clé and Booksellers Association, and the Irish Insurance Federation. A further two proposed sectoral codes are currently at an advanced stage of examination by the director's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retailers who subscribe to either the national code or to sectoral codes of practice on dual display approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs commit to displaying prices in both Irish pounds and euros at a minimum from 1 October 2001 to 9 March 2002. They also undertake to provide information in-store to help customers understand the conversion to euros and to facilitate price comparison. Subscribers to national and sectoral codes will be entitled to display a special logo devised by the Director of Consumer Affairs as evidence of a commitment to implement the changeover fairly. The logo will contain details of who consumers should contact <Col N="851" /> with complaints of non-compliance. Should the matter not be resolved at this level, the complaint may also be referred to the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>The level of subscriptions to both the national and sectoral codes is already encouraging and is anticipated to increase steadily as 1 October approaches. The Director of Consumer Affairs has also planned the timing of a promotional campaign urging consumers to shop where they see the logo to coincide with the commencement of the minimum period of application of the codes. While adherence to the codes of practice is voluntary, all businesses should welcome the opportunity to demonstrate to consumers, by subscribing to the codes and advertising the fact that they have done so, that they are committed to carrying out the changeover to the euro fairly.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners certain essential services currently undertaken by participants on CE will be mainstreamed. This process involves the transfer of CE funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for the services in question. Services in the schools sector are being prioritised at present in this regard.</P>
      <P>As announced yesterday, the mainstreaming process in schools is now under way involving the transfer of CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to the Department of Education and Science in time for the new school year beginning in September next. It is intended under the mainstreaming process that all schools, including those who have never benefited from CE funding, will receive additional funding. During a transition period some schools will receive the additional funding from the Department of Education and Science while still benefiting from the services of CE participants, as CE incumbents who opt to serve out their contracts will be facilitated in doing so. However, it should be noted that, as part of the mainstreaming process, CE participants will not be replaced in schools when their term has finished. Schools services will in future be solely the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Where possible, supervisors who may be affected by the mainstreaming of schools services will be accommodated on other projects as vacancies arise. In addition, some social economy projects are likely to be in a position to offer employment when they are fully operational. It is also important to note that supervisors are continually leaving the programme to avail of the opportunities that present themselves in the open labour market. In implementing the change process, full account will be taken of the needs of individuals affected by the changeover.</P>

      <P>In the past 18 months IDA Ireland has radically changed its strategy with a view to achieving a better regional distribution of jobs. The agency's new strategy includes a focused sectoral and geographical approach for new inward investment projects, coupled with an added value focus for the existing base of overseas industry in each region. This new strategy also provides for an upgrading of IDA Ireland's land in regional locations and the provision of new modern facilities in appropriate locations to cater for the emerging sectors. In this context, the IDA's strategies for Wexford and Donegal have been formulated and tailored, following a wide consultative process, to meet the specific needs of each of these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of County Donegal, IDA's Donegal regional office was re-established in Letterkenny. In addition, IDA is in the process of relocating a number of key operating units into the north-west region. Engineering and consumer products, along with a section of international services, are relocating to Sligo. This move is designed to stimulate and support growth from within the <Col N="854" /> region. IDA's strategy for the region is beginning to show positive results and the agency are confident that the recovery of jobs in the area will become more apparent as the new projects which have been approved make their impact in the years ahead. In this regard, significant developments in the Donegal area include the development of Letterkenny Business Park, which has been completed. PacifiCare, which currently employs 180 people, now occupies building one. The company recently announced an expansion project to create an additional 160 jobs at full development. Work is nearing completion on the provision of a second 25,000 square foot advance factory at the park and planning permission has been sought for a third advance factory.</P>
    <P>Prudential Insurance Company of America has occupied a new office facility at Letterkenny Office Park and currently employs 150 persons. Also, Prumerica has announced an expansion of their operation, which will create an additional 450 jobs. The project will be located in a second office facility on this park. Other job expansions in the area include, Kirchhoff Ireland which recently announced an expansion of its automotive components operation in Letterkenny. The company currently employs 53 people and the expansion will employ an additional 50 people at full development. Interventional Technologies, IVT, which is now owned by Boston Scientific, has announced plans to create an additional 90 jobs through the expansion of their existing operation in Letterkenny. Abbott Laboratories in Donegal town, which employs 550 people, announced plans to invest £50 million, with the support of IDA Ireland, for the development of its operation, which will secure the future of the facility. In Ballyshannon work has commenced on the development of a business park and it is planned to provide a 20,000 square foot factory on this park.</P>
    <P>Buncrana is the focus of IDA efforts on the Inishowen Peninsula. Additional land has been purchased in Buncrana and planning permission has been sought for a 20,000 square foot building. Work will commence shortly on the development of this land. Claddagh Resources, formerly Network Resources, research facility at Lisfannon, plans to create 35 new jobs, the majority for people with third level qualifications. Recruitment by the company is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The previously vacant Fruit of the Loom facility at Malin has been sold to Donegal County Council to facilitate the development of an operation by Forward Emphasis which is due to be opened later this month. Lands surplus to the needs of IDA for inward investment purposes are in the process of being sold to Donegal County Council to assist in the development of local projects with job creating potential. IDA is also marketing vacant facilities previously occupied by Fruit of the Loom at Ballymacarry and Lisfannon Buncrana as well as Milford and Raphoe.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above positive developments, the implementation of the Donegal employment <Col N="855" /> initiative task force's recommendations has been allocated to the County Development Board and IDA is participating in the work of the board. Also, as part of IDA's regional agenda for the north-west region, the agency has put in place a programme to encourage the development of infrastructure, skills, and education in the region to enhance its attractiveness for new inward investment. Work is ongoing in the area of roads, telecommunications, electricity as there are particular issues to be addressed. I am confident that the strategy being pursued by IDA Ireland for County Donegal will result in the creation of good and enduring employment for the area.</P>

      <P>Funding is available under the regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to support the development of business incubation and research and development space in institutes of technology. The operational programmes for the BMW and southern and eastern regions each contain a sub-programme on local enterprise development. The objectives of this programme include enhancing the quality and availability of employment and building research and technological development within the region.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the programme are concerned with strengthening the regional innovation infrastructure by facilitating the provision of incubation and commercial R&amp;D space for the development and establishment of high potential businesses, with a particular emphasis on the role of the institutes of technology. Under the terms of the measure, funds are available to institutes of technology to develop and expand incubation space and commercial research and development facilities. The main objectives of the measure are to support the development and expansion of campus company activity; to encourage and support the commercialisation of R&amp;D carried out in the institutes of technology and to embed the institutes of technology as major supports for the development of high-tech companies in the regions.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme, CE, is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into employment in the open labour market. Through CE participants are provided with valuable opportunities for development and training, and communities are provided with the resources necessary to provide services locally and/or develop their local area. Opportunities, in an increasingly positive labour market environment, for CE participants who have completed their term on the programme to obtain permanent employment are influenced by location, education and the skill level of the participants.</P>
      <P>There are currently in the region of 33,500 participants on CE, of whom 10,520 are over 50 years of age. Following a restructuring of the programme in 1999 participation levels are gradually being reduced to 28,000 by the end of 2003. The mainstreaming of certain essential services currently undertaken by CE participants, which will provide new employment opportunities for CE participants and other long-term unemployed persons, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. The maximum duration on CE for all participants is three years with the exception of offshore island inhabitants and participants on drugs taskforce projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is finalising proposals for a high supports process, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will enhance the range of options available for job seekers with employment barriers, including older persons on CE who have limited employment opportunities in the open labour market.

    <P>My Department is also considering with FÁS the issue of older persons, workers in rural areas and others who have previously participated on CE and who are having difficulty progressing to open employment. This issue will be also considered in the context of developing policy for the high supports process and in the light of the implications of both elements for the future operation of CE following the mainstreaming of essential services.</P>

      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, became law on 1 April 2000. The national minimum hourly rate of pay has been increased from £4.40 to £4.70 with effect from 1 July 2001. The Act applies to all employees except the following categories of employees who are excluded from its provisions: close relative of the employer such as a spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother and sister and apprentices within the meaning of the Industrial Training Act, 1967 and Labour Services Act, 1987. Other apprentices are covered.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, an employee means a person of any age who has entered into, or works or has worked under, a contract of employment. A contract of employment means a contract of service or apprenticeship or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person or a third person, whether or not the third person is a party to the contract. An experienced adult worker must be paid an average hourly rate of pay that is not less than £4.70 per working hour in a week, a fortnight or no longer than a month, known as a pay reference period. A reduced rate of 70% of the national minimum hourly rate of pay applies to employees under age 18 and sub-minimum rates of the national minimum hourly rate of pay apply to employees entering employment for the first time on reaching the age of 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-minimum rates also apply to employees who undergo a prescribed course of study or training authorised by the employer. The course of study or training must satisfy certain criteria as set by regulations made under the Act. A 20 year old apprentice who is outside the scope of the second criterion outlined above is entitled to a minimum wage rate. The rate to which he is entitled to is dependent on whether he is in the first, second or subsequent year of employment since reaching the age of 18 or whether his train<Col N="858" /> ing satisfies the criteria set out under regulations made under the Act, in which case training rates would apply.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 53 to 55, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputy are day to day matters for Enterprise Ireland and ones in which I have no direct function. However, I recognise the impact that community led initiatives such as the Enterprise Ireland community enterprise centres schemes have had on the creation of new businesses and the development of employment opportunities in smaller towns and deprived urban areas.</P>
      <P>In order to identify the lessons from the scheme and the issues that emerged during its implementation, including, for example, cost and funding requirements, a report on the existing Enterprise Ireland community enterprise scheme (1989) was commissioned late last year. This report is now nearing completion and it is expected that, on foot of its findings and recommendations, consideration will be given to the implementation of a new scheme.</P>

      <Quest> the regulations in relation to a non-national who has worked here under a work permit for five years with the same employer and is now seeking other work as the employer has withdrawn from the country; if this person must apply for another work permit; if, after five years having a work permit and paying tax, this person's status has improved; and if this person may continue to work without a permit. </Quest>

      <P>Applications for work permits are made by employers who seek to employ non-EEA, European Economic Area, nationals. In the circumstances where a non-EEA national is employed by the same employer for five years, the employer may then apply for and receive a work permit without limit in respect of that employee. If an employee changes employment for any reason, a new application for a work permit must be made by the prospective new employer. A person who works without having a valid work permit is working illegally. The question of this person's status in the context of immigration law is being addressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in a separate reply to a similar question.</P>

      <P>Arising from recommendations from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, my Department records details of all consultancy type projects, including those in respect of PR, on an interdepartmental consultancy database. The following schedule sets out details of all such consultancies in respect of the years 2000 and 2001. Consultancies that are completed or are ongoing are included. Where consultancies are not yet completed and no payments have as yet been made, the cost included is the estimated final cost of the consultancy.</P>
      <P>Press relations for my Department are the responsibility of my Department's press office, which employs five full time civil servants, including one principal officer, one higher executive officer, one executive officer and two clerical officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the task force I established under the chairmanship of Dr. John Mangan to advise me on transport logistics in connection with ports. The task force will examine the potential and prospects for increasing the volume of port traffic which is transported by rail and the transfer of port generated freight traffic from road to rail including the development of rail head facilities at existing ports; for transport of freight across transport modes by night-off peak; traffic diversion including by rail, pipeline, including relocation of oil tank farms, and to other less congested ports out<Col N="862" /> side Dublin. The task force will also seek to identify other imaginative proposals to reduce congestion and make port access-egress more efficient and identify cost effective options for the movement of port related traffic through Dublin and the possibility for transfer of non essential activities away from ports.</P>
      <P>In addition to these specific tasks, I have indicated that the group will be free to advise on any aspects of transport logistics in connection with ports which they feel merits comment. The task force has met on five occasions since its inaugural meeting in March. I am advised that the group intends to take into account various reports and have regard to best international experience and practice. In an effort to consult as widely as possible they placed advertisements in the national media inviting submissions and have received presentations from interested parties. In addition, the group is undertaking supplementary surveys to gather relevant data on, for example, origin and destination traffic flows. The chairman has advised that because of the extensive consultation process I can expect to have an interim report after September 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The Common Fisheries Policy review is already under way at EU level and will conclude with decisions at the end of 2002. My view on the need for radical change is fully supported by the Government, the Commissioner and fellow EU fisheries Ministers. Ireland's strategy on the review of the Common Fisheries Policy &ndash; CFP &ndash; is informed by the comprehensive proposals and recommendations of the CFP National Strategy Review Group chaired by Padraic White which the Government established in 1998.</P>
      <P>The group published its proposals and recommendations last November in advance of both the Commission's Green Paper and the first substantive debate by Ministers at the European Council of Ministers on 18 June. This enabled Ireland to influence and input into the Commission's thinking. I have discussed our key priorities in the Green Paper in detail with Commissioner Fischler and my EU ministerial colleagues.</P>
      <P>At the recent EU Council of Ministers I welcomed the fact that the Commission thinking reflected a number of Ireland's priorities. I also welcomed the Commission's acknowledgement of the need for improved governance within the CFP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasised, however, that the policy must be developed in parallel with social, regional, cohesion and other EU policies. The Green Paper focuses on the sustainability of resources, but the social and economic aspects of sustainable <Col N="865" /> development must also be addressed. The CFP must take greater account of the wider objectives of accountability, clarity, transparency and coherence and I urged colleagues and the Commissioner to take account of this in our collective setting of new directions.</P>
    <P>In line with the stated position of successive Governments, I made and will continue to make Ireland's case for a more equitable share of resources in the overall context of the relative stability principle.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 69 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated on previous occasions in the House, the Government is continuing to reflect on the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum, and the various concerns expressed during the course of the campaign before deciding on the way forward. Many of these concerns evidently related to issues which are not covered by the <Col N="866" /> Treaty of Nice itself, but to the wider perspective of our relationship with the Union in the longer-term. In preparation for the debate on the future of Europe and as part of this broad process of reflection, the Government has announced that a national forum on Europe will be established. The forum will provide an opportunity for wide-ranging discussion of Ireland's role in the Union in the context of the Union's expected enlargement.</P>
    <P>The Government will shortly consult with the Opposition regarding the forum's terms of reference, its composition, and method of operation. The Government recognises that the successful experience of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is widely seen as a useful model in this regard. It is hoped that agreement can be reached on these matters before the end of this month, with the forum operational by early autumn.</P>
    <P>The Government has availed of appropriate opportunities to brief our partners on the situation following the referendum, and on the path which the Government proposes to follow. The other member states have expressed their respect for the decision of the Irish people, while also reiterating their conviction that the Treaty of Nice remains essential for enlargement. They have emphasised their readiness to help in any possible way to find a way forward, without reopening the text of the Nice treaty.</P>

The Red Cross family is made up of the International Committee of the Red Cross &ndash; ICRC &ndash; , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies &ndash; IFRC &ndash; and the national societies, of which the Irish Red Cross is one. The ICRC and the IFRC are two of the partner organisations with which the Government works <Col N="867" /> in responding to emergencies and humanitarian disasters.</P>
    <P>Each year the ICRC and IFRC launch their respective annual emergency appeals. Appeals are also launched following sudden onset disasters. These appeals, which are issued directly to Governments and other members of the international donor community, are the normal channels through which Ireland Aid allocates funding to the Red Cross. As both Red Cross agencies are based in Geneva, contact is made and maintained through the Irish Mission in Geneva rather than the Irish Red Cross, which works under their aegis. This has been, and continues to be, the established practice in relation to the humanitarian working contacts between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Red Cross family.</P>
    <P>Ireland contributed a total of £1.54 million to the ICRC in 2000 for humanitarian relief and rehabilitation assistance programmes. So far this year, the Government has contributed £1.45 million to the ICRC for their appeals in Afghanistan, Burundi, Iraq, Kenya, Rwanda and Sudan. In addition, the IFRC received £444,613 during 2000 for humanitarian emergencies in Belize, Madagascar, Mongolia and Venezuela. To date during 2001, the federation has received a total of £700,000 from the Government in response to the earthquakes which struck El Salvador, India and more recently Peru. A further £100,000 was allocated to the IFRC emergency preparedness programme in Latin America.</P>
    <P>The Department of Defence makes a separate, multilateral contribution to the ICRC, by way of its normal annual contribution towards its organisational costs &ndash; £100,000 in 2000. The Department of Defence administers this and supports the staffing costs of the Dublin headquarters of the Irish Red Cross Society through a grant-in-aid, which this year amounts to £609,000. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for services provided by the Government to refugees and asylum seekers. The role of the Department of Foreign Affairs in the provision of services to refugees ended on 2 April 2001, when the Refugee Agency was incorporated into the Reception and Integration Agency at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body and the Department of Foreign Affairs is not involved in its administration.</P>
    <P>As part of its ongoing responses to humanitarian emergencies, the Government will continue to work closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross and its affiliates of the Red Cross family. This reflects the high regard in which they are held by Ireland and other members of the international community and the important role which they fulfil in providing early assistance to vulnerable and suffering people.</P>

      <P>No effort has been spared by the Government to recover access for Ireland's beef and live cattle exports to those international markets which have been closed as a result of the BSE and foot and mouth diseases crisis.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, other members of the Government, including myself, together with An Bord Bia and our embassies abroad, have been working intensively to achieve this key objective.</P>
      <P>Much of our effort has been focused on Egypt, our most important market for beef outside the EU, worth £200 million annually, which has been closed to us since December last. The Taoiseach has spoken to President Mubarak on the question. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, visited Egypt last December and further visits there at official and veterinary level have taken place since then.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has maintained close contact with his opposite numbers in Egypt and in a number of other important markets, to reassure them of the high quality and safety of Irish food products and to urge an early review the import ban in each case.</P>
      <P>I visited Libya in June of last year to conduct negotiations with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister there on the question of the reopening of that market for live cattle and beef. On my instruction, our ambassador to Libya, based in Rome, will visit Tripoli next week to pursue this question further with the Libyan authorities.</P>
      <P>The beef trade with Iran is the subject of continuing contacts with the Iranian authorities, both directly and through diplomatic channels. As a result, Iran approved the Irish veterinary certificate for beef exports in April 2000. Official level contacts, with a view to ensuring that Ireland is included in the list of countries invited to tender for supplies of beef to Iran, are continuing.</P>

      <P>The reports of human rights violations committed in Irian Jaya, or West Papua, as it is sometimes known, are a cause of serious concern to the Government. I am particularly concerned that the perpetrators of such violations, often members of the Indonesian security forces, have not been brought to justice.</P>
      <P>This issue was discussed most recently at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in May. On that occasion we reiterated our call on the Indonesian authorities to strengthen respect for human rights throughout Indonesia. We also stressed the importance of the democratic accountability of the police and armed forces. The EU is furthermore pursuing a political dialogue with the Indonesian authorities at which our human rights concerns are brought to their attention.</P>
      <P>At the United Nations, the UN Commission on Human Rights has been dealing with this issue. At the last session of the Commission in Geneva earlier this year, the EU encouraged the Indonesian authorities to establish human rights tribunals to try the suspects of human rights violations and stressed in particular the need to investigate reports of disappearances, arbitrary detentions, extrajudicial executions and torture in Irian Jaya.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to avail of every opportunity to urge the Indonesian authorities to ensure that the rights of the people of Irian Jaya are fully respected.</P>
      <P>The Government, as well as our EU partners and Indonesia's neighbouring states, encourage the Indonesian Government to address the root causes of dissent in Irian Jaya through meaningful dialogue with local authorities. In this context, we support plans currently being finalised for regional autonomy for Irian Jaya, which attempt to address the province's problems, without affecting the territorial integrity of Indonesia.</P>

      <P>In cases where this proof is not available, for instance where a birth has not been registered, the Passport Office usually provides temporary passport facilities on the basis of alternative evidence of birth in Ireland such as a baptismal certificate. In such cases the Passport Office requests that the person arrange for late registration of his or her birth so that full passport facilities may subsequently be provided.</P>

      <P>The Railway Safety Programme, 1999 to 2003, was agreed by Government in March 1999.

I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that they plan to have the entire section renewed by 2004.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer provision for railway safety in 2001 is £102 million. This is in line with the expenditure profile in the Railway Safety Programme, 1999 to 2003, which was approved by the Government in March 1999. Iarnród Éireann advised my Department on 7 June that it had reviewed its railway safety expenditure priorities in the light of available funding. The company had indicated that it intended to begin the renewal of the East Wall bridge in 2001 and to complete it in 2002. In light of the available funding for 2001 and its assessment of safety priorities, Iarnród Éireann is now proposing that all of the work will be carried out in 2002.</P>
      <P>I recently asked my Department to carry out an early review of the scope for the possible provision of some additional funding for the Railway Safety Programme in 2001. If such funds become available, it will be a matter for Iarnród Éireann to reassess its priorities for safety expenditure.</P>
      <P>The bridge has been struck by heavy goods vehicles on many occasions over the past number of years resulting in disruptions to train services and also giving rise to a potential significant risk to the safety of the railway. The integrity of the bridge has been affected and it needs to be replaced in order to remove this risk.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are physical restrictions on heavy goods vehicles accessing a section of the East Wall Road pending the carrying out of this work. While I am aware that these restrictions have a disruptive effect on heavy vehicle traffic movement in the area, the restrictions are necessary to protect the integrity of the bridge pending its renewal.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed under the national development plan to invest in excess of £1 billion in the railway system during the life of the plan. The major projects in hand are redesign of the station approaches and signalling at Connolly Station to allow more train paths at peak hours; quadrupling of the track from Heuston Station to Kildare and upgrading services along the Kildare line; upgrading DART services; provision of a depot to maintain diesel railcars at Drogheda; mainline railway carriages; and the rail safety programme. The estimated costs of these projects are the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and Iarnród Éireann and CIE.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office Strategy, 2000 &ndash; 2016, entitled A Platform for Change, published in September 2000, recommends that a new rail line be constructed off the Maynooth line near Clonsilla via Dunboyne to Navan. The report envisages the rail link being completed in two phases: the construction of a spur from Clonsilla to Dunboyne, to be completed by 2006; and the extension of the line to Navan to be completed by 2010. The DTO strategy proposals represent a major investment programme which expands the scope of the proposals originally envisaged in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, metro and light rail projects are recommended in the DTO strategy proposals. These projects are to be developed as public private partnerships. The level of Exchequer funding for these projects, if any, will be determined as part of the negotiation process during procurement. The most recent DTO estimate in 2001 prices of the cost of the proposals is approximately £5.7 billion for the metro and £1.2 billion for additional light rail lines.</P>

      <P>The Government policy is that there should be no post office closures. However, when vacancies do arise within the network, either through illness, death or retirement, An Post advertises the post at least twice and actively canvass for suitable persons to fill the vacant posi<Col N="875" /> tions. It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found that a post office is closed on a temporary basis pending an application from such a person. Arrangements for the re-opening of post offices is an operational matter for An Post.</P>

      <P>Decisions in relation to the opening or reopening of railway lines are matters for the board and management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that they have no plans to re-open rail lines in either Cavan or Monaghan. I am advised that the rail lines in these counties have been closed since the late 1950s and early 1960s.</P>
      <P>The rail investment programme, which is currently being implemented by Iarnród Éireann as part of the national development plan, is the largest investment ever made in Ireland's railways. A major component of this investment is the Railway Safety Programme, 1999 to 2003, which provides for expenditure of £430.6 million on rail safety over that period.</P>
      <P>The resources available for rail investment are limited and must be utilised so that the best value for money is achieved for the Irish public. Therefore, the investment programme is being implemented in a prioritised manner taking account of rail safety, customer demand and expected economic benefit.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office's long-term strategic plan, A Platform for Change, for public transport in the greater Dublin area includes proposals for the extension of the light rail network to the northside of Dublin, as well as for the development of a metro system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the metro line, from the airport and Blanchardstown to the city centre, is being progressed as a matter of priority. The light rail project office of CIE has recently completed <Col N="876" /> a successful public consultation exercise regarding this line. Submissions were received from over 200 groups and individuals and these submissions will be considered during the development of the route alignments. My Department has also consulted the market regarding a framework for developing the metro line on a public private partnership basis. The responses received from a significant number of interested parties are being assessed at present.</P>
    <P>I will bring specific proposals to the Government in the coming weeks on the development of the metro with a view to initiating the procurement process before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The proposals for a light rail system are based on a line from the city centre to Ballymun via Whitehall and to extend this line to Sillogue by 2010. A further spur from Whitehall to Kilbarrack is also proposed by 2010. These proposals are currently being evaluated by the light rail project office of CIE.</P>

      <P>Ireland became a party to the conventions on 27 September 1962. The text of all four conventions was printed in the Irish Treaty Series of 1963, for the information of the public.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Irish Red Cross Society disseminates information in relation to humanitarian law. I might add that in relation to the Defence Forces, legal officers and other officers of the Defence Forces attend courses on international humanitarian law, and instruction is given on the subject in the Military College and in other training establishments throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated, however, I have no function in the administration of the Irish Red Cross Society. I do not get involved in the day-to-day running of its affairs. The society is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council. I am also mindful that a fundamental principle of the International Committee of the Red Cross is that all Red Cross and Red Crescent societies enjoy freedom from political involvement worldwide. My Department, as in the past, is available to provide help and assistance to the society as and when requested.</P>
      <P>My Department administers a grant-in-aid to the Irish Red Cross Society, which this year amounts to £609,000. The grant-in-aid mainly covers the salaries of 14 permanent staff in the headquarters of the society, and salary and related expenses for a staff member on full-time secondment to the directorate for asylum seekers services, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It also includes the State's annual contribution of £100,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.

      <P>The principles of veterinary certification require veterinary officials of my Department to certify only those matters which they can stand over. Ireland has always had a high animal health status and the integrity and high reputation of its veterinary certification process has always played a major role in ensuring that international markets remained open to Irish produce.</P>
      <P>From time to time, third countries request assurances in veterinary certificates which simply cannot be given. Usually a compromise is reached, based on a modified wording in the relevant certificates which satisfies the competent authorities in the relevant third country and which the veterinary official signing the certificates can stand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> It is the policy of this Department to facilitate exports by providing veterinary certification in the manner required wherever possible. This policy does not, however, extend to providing certificates which the certifying officer cannot stand over.</P>
    <P>In this case I understand that against the background of the foot and mouth disease crisis, the Turkish authorities were not willing to accept the certification that my Department was in a position to provide. However, I understand that this matter has now been resolved and that my Department is issuing veterinary certificates for the export of hides to Turkey to the person referred to and to other hide exporters as required.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any specific problems in relation to exports to Poland, but I have arranged for an official to contact the person referred to in this regard.</P>

In conducting these control checks I have asked my officials to pay particular attention to sheep slaughter data in meat plants and to details of movements under the permit <Col N="880" /> arrangements introduced on 3 March last.

      <P>The primary purpose of the 30 day retention period is to control the spread of disease. In the context of the recent foot and mouth disease emergency, I consider that this measure, together with the range of movement restrictions introduced, was a critical success factor in the containment of the disease to a single outbreak in this jurisdiction. I am aware that the measure has had implications for trading in cattle. I have already relaxed a variety of the movement restrictions that were in place in relation to cattle movements from farm to farm, through marts and to slaughter plants. I have made specific arrangements for an exemption <Col N="883" /> from the 30 day requirement in respect of live exports. I will keep the matter under close review in consultation with the expert group which I established to advise me on such matters.</P>

      <P>The background to this case is that the 1998 area aid application of the person named was originally cleared for payment with no errors, and various area aid related payments issued. Subsequently a dual claim emerged on two parcels following the processing of the area aid application of another herdowner. Entitlement to these two parcels was determined in favour of the other herdowner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resulted in an overclaim of some 8.27 hectares or 21.39% of the total area claimed by the person named. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, my Department has no option other than to apply a 100% penalty to the application when the overclaim on the area declared is greater than <Col N="884" /> 20%. Therefore, in this case, an amount incorrectly paid of £11,755.11 in respect of the year 1998 must be recouped. A total of £4,307.91 was offset against his livestock applications in 2000, leaving the balance of £7,447.20 still to be recouped from future grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that redundancy lump sum payments fall into two separate categories, statutory redundancy payments payable under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, and <i>ex gratia</i> payments made by an employer to an employee on redundancy.</P>
      <P>Statutory redundancy payments are exempt from income tax under the provisions of section 203 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. <i>Ex gratia</i> payments, that is, the amount paid by an employer over and above the statutory redundancy payments, are chargeable to income tax under the provisions of section 123 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, subject to exemptions and reliefs available under section 201, and Schedule 3, of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Generally, an individual is entitled to the higher of the following exemptions in respect of a first redundancy or retirement payment: the basic exemption of £8,000 plus £600 for each full year of service; the increased exemption whereby the basic exemption may be increased by up to a maximum of £4,000 where an individual is not a member of an occupational pension scheme or irrevocably gives up his or right to receive a lump sum from the pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual is a member of an occupational pension scheme the increased exemption of £4,000 is reduced by: any tax-free lump sum from a pension scheme to which the individual may be immediately entitled; or the present day value at the date of redundancy of any tax-free lump sum which may be receivable by the individual from the pension scheme in the future. Alternatively, an individual may be entitled to relief called the standard capital superannuation benefit &ndash; SCSB. This relief generally benefits those with high earnings and long service. It is a <Col N="890" /> relief given for each year of service equal to 1/15th of the average annual pay for the last three years of service to date of leaving less any tax-free lump sum entitlement from the pension scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the exemptions-reliefs outlined above, an individual may be entitled to what is known as top slicing relief. Effectively, this relief limits the rate of tax payable on the taxable portion of the lump sum to the average rate of tax borne by the individual over the previous five years.</P>
    <P>Revenue's Information Leaflet IT 21, entitled Lump Sum Payments on Redundancy/Retire ment, sets out in detail how these reliefs-exemptions are applied. I will forward a copy to the Deputy for his information.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, no distinction is made between <i>ex gratia</i> payments and non-statutory redundancy payments. Consequently, the question of Revenue requiring evidence as to the nature of the payment does not arise.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for a person to retire permanently to avail of the exemptions and reliefs available under section 201 and Schedule 3 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>Article 279 of the treaty establishing the European Community provides for Council of Ministers decisions on the financial regulation on the Community budget. At present, Council decisions under the article are subject to unanimity.</P>
      <P>As stated in Appendix 5 to the Government's White Paper on the Treaty of Nice, Article 279 is among those articles which, under the Treaty of Nice, would become subject to qualified majority voting. The qualified majority voting would apply to the Article from 1 January 2007.</P>
      <P>Decisions made under the article relate to the financial regulation on the fundamental principles applying to the EU budget. More specifically, the regulation details the main rules for the establishment of the budget and its implementation, including accounting and bookkeeping procedures; defines the roles and responsibilities of those involved in the budget implementation; and outlines the parameters for the monitoring and control of the budget implementation, including by the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the regulation are made by Council on a Commission proposal, after consulting the Parliament, and after obtaining the opinion of the Court of Auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> The regulation has been amended on numerous occasions since its adoption in 1977. The European Court of Auditors Opinion 4/97 of 17 July 1997 called for a complete recasting of the regulation as in its view, the effect of successive amendments over time was to create a number of grey areas. A Commission proposal to recast the regulation is currently being considered at working group level by the Council. The main objective of the proposal is to simplify and streamline the regulation in order to ensure that the financial management of the budget remains in line with best modern practice.</P>
    <P>A change to qualified majority voting from 2007, as provided for in the Treaty of Nice, would facilitate Council decision-making on the regulation and would not be expected to pose significant difficulties for any individual member state.</P>

      <P>Section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides for an income tax deduction in respect of the cost of employing a person to care for an incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>Where an individual proves that, throughout the tax year a relative is totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity, and the individual has employed a person to care for the incapacitated person, an income tax deduction equivalent to the cost of employing the carer, subject to a maximum of £10,000 in a full year or £7,400 in the current short year, may be claimed. A relative includes a relation by marriage and a person in respect of whom the claimant is or was the legal guardian. The carer may be employed on an individual basis or through an agency.</P>
      <P>Where a number of individuals are incurring the cost of employing the carer in respect of any one incapacitated person, the income tax deduction is apportioned between them on the basis of each individual's contribution.</P>
      <P>The cost of employing a carer is not a health expense for the purposes of section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act. The MED 1 form is used to claim tax relief on health expenses. It cannot be used to claim the deduction for employing a carer. A form for claiming the deduction for the employment of a carer can be obtained from the tax office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income tax relief is available for those who covenant income to those aged 65 years and over, and to those who are permanently incapacitated. <Col N="892" /> In the case of the elderly, the amount of income which can be covenanted is limited to 5% of the income of the donor. There is no limit on the amount that can be covenanted to the incapacitated. Covenant relief is available at the taxpayers marginal rate of tax. However, covenanted income can have an impact on the elderly or incapacitated person's means tested social welfare pension and income tax position. There are no conditions on what the covenanted income may be used for. There is no tax advantage in using covenants as the employment of a carer deduction can be claimed directly by the individual incurring the expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, in June 1997, in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997, the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>  would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates of those deals, the only change being that there would be a guaranteed minimum increase of 3% &ndash; or 2% in the case of any pensioners who had already received an advance payment of 1%.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases. Some organisations had difficulties in interpreting how these guidelines applied to certain groups of pensioners. These issues were subsequently resolved and my Department, along with other Departments, made every effort to ensure that public sector bodies implemented fully the terms of the Government decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were, however, problems due to the fact that some pensioner groups objected to the terms of the guidelines. Those guidelines were framed with full regard to the way that parity had traditionally been applied even before the PCW deals were negotiated and, as such, they excluded pensioners from benefiting from payments such as new allowances, existing non-pensionable <Col N="893" /> allowances being made pensionable for the first time, long service increments which were personal to certain serving groups of employees, post upgradings etc. Despite this, some pensioner groups sought to have the benefit of such payments applied to them. It would, of course, have been a breach of parity to do this.</P>
    <P>In 2000, it was agreed with the trades unions concerned that the personal long-service increments paid under the various PCW restructuring pay deals would be made permanent for serving staff with effect from 1 April 2000; accordingly, these long service increments are being passed on to the relevant pensioners in the normal way provided that they have the required service on the maximum of the relevant scales.</P>
    <P>The benefit of all relevant pay increases since November 1997 under Partnership 2000 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness have been passed on to pensioners.</P>

      <P>Extensive information activities have been carried out <Col N="894" /> with a view to enabling the public, including older people, to make a smooth transition to the euro. The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI, has been running national television, radio and newspaper campaigns. These campaigns have particularly targeted media, and times, aimed at reaching groups at risk of low awareness, including older people. The board has also carried out other extensive public information activities since its establishment in 1998. These have included distributing a leaflet to every household every year since 1998, including earlier this year; widespread circulation of leaflets and posters otherwise; provision of a LoCall enquiry line; and provision of materials for people with low awareness of the euro including a number of conversion charts, some of which are particularly suitable for older people with visual impairment. The ECBI has also produced a euro bingo game which is proving popular with older people.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the board set up a consultative panel of organisations representing people in low-awareness groups or people likely to have special needs for the changeover, in order to help identify their needs, advise on how they should be met and help in meeting them. The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, the National Council for Ageing and Older People, Age Action Ireland, Age and Opportunity and Muintir na Tíre represent older people on this panel. Information materials have been widely distributed through the networks of organisations represented on the panel. In addition, in 1999 the ECBI sent an information pack on the euro to over 900 centres for older people around the country. The information pack included posters, information leaflets and a public information video. The board also distributed information packs to every citizens information centre and money advice and budgeting centre in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the ECBI established a committee of Departments dealing with low-awareness customers, including social welfare pensioners and public service pensioners. Specific information has been sent to such customers by a number of Departments and more is planned. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is at present distributing a leaflet entitled <i>Social Welfare, the euro and You</i> to every household in the country. Also, pension books issuing in October 2001 will include information on the euro, as will a newsletter going out to pensioners and a euro mailshot going to all customers in November 2001. Civil and public service pensioners are being catered for by the relevant Government Departments paying them. The Paymaster General's office has already provided detailed euro information to civil service pensioners in its most recent newsletter issued in June and plans to provide additional detailed information later in the year. Additional information will also be provided by the retired pensioners' association. Retired teachers will receive euro information with their payslips in August 2001 and retired teachers' associations will <Col N="895" /> produce association magazine articles on the changeover. Other public service pensioners being provided with euro information over the coming months include Garda pensioners, defence forces pensioners and forestry pensioners.</P>
    <P>The ECBI also runs a programme whereby funding assistance is provided for activities by NGOs promoting euro awareness. This programme has been in operation since 1998 and has, in the four tranches completed to date, supported a number of organisations representing the needs of older people. In the latest and fifth tranche, nine projects approved for funding have been put forward by NGOs specifically representing older people. Many of the rest of the approximately 160 approved projects are from community and voluntary groups which would cover older people among others.</P>
    <P>Public information activities on the euro are increasing as we get closer to January and will increase further from September onwards. In particular, the ECBI will send a handbook on the changeover to every household in the country in the autumn. I am pleased to tell the Deputy that the ECBI has gone to tender for the production of 1.5 million handheld electronic euro converters that will convert Irish pound amounts to euro and euro amounts to Irish pounds in a simple, easy-to-use manner. The aim is that the converters will be distributed free to every household in the country in November 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 153 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>I signed the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001, (Commencement) Order, 2001, on 28 June last and this commenced the automatic eligibility of persons aged 70 years and over for medical cards with effect from 1 July. No other regulations are required to give effect to this provision of the Act. The automatic right to eligibility is confined to the person in the relevant age category. The provision does not extend to dependants below the age of 70. However, persons aged 70 and over retain the option of applying for a medical card in the normal way and, if their application is successful, the medical card would extend to any dependants, irrespective of age, as is currently the case.</P>
      <P>As both the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union have agreed to operate the new arrangements on an interim basis pending ballots of their respective members, no difficulties are anticipated either with doctors participating in the scheme or with pharmacists dispensing drugs from the common list free of charge. Accordingly, the contingencies identified do not arise. My Department has held six meetings with the Irish Medical Organisation to resolve this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed my concerns on the issue of under age drinking on numerous occasions. The health promotion unit of my Department is involved in several measures aimed at addressing this issue. Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol. Children are targeted through the substance misuse prevention programme called Walk Tall which was developed and delivered in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science, the health boards and teachers. Training in this programme has been given to 95% of primary schools. Adolescents are targeted through the substance abuse prevention programme, SAPP, called On My Own Two Feet which will form part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. To date, two-thirds of post primary schools have received training in this programme. The SAPP programme is also available for youth leaders working in local communities and at risk youth groups. Training is available for professionals and parents at community level through the regional health boards, with the purpose of helping long-term prevention of alcohol and drug misuse.</P>
      <P>A training initiative developed in association with the drinks industry on the responsible serving of alcohol has been established. This is a training course for those in the pub trade and hospitality industry and was developed in co-operation with the drinks industry group and CERT. Some of the issues addressed in this programme are the prevention of serving those under-age, those who are going to drink and drive and those who are already intoxicated.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit commissioned the first national lifestyle surveys, the Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition and the Health Behaviour in School Aged Children HBSC. They provide a profile of health-related behaviours including current drinking patterns. The first report was published in 1999. Follow-up surveys will be conducted at regular intervals. Research is currently being carried out in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people, the results of which are expected in the near future. This research will inform future policy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new campaign aimed at young high risk drinkers has been launched. This campaign emphasises the choices open to young people and promotes a healthier lifestyle. The alcohol awareness <Col N="899" /> campaign carries the slogan &ldquo;Less Is More &ndash; It's your Choice&rdquo;. It promotes alternative activities to drinking and encourages people to examine their lifestyle. As part of that campaign, the health promotion unit of my Department held a special seminar which was attended by over 100 stakeholders including health professionals, youth groups, teachers, parents, community groups, vintners and the Garda. At local level, the Department is working with youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people. Many of the health boards have already developed successful programmes to tackle some of the issues, and my Department will be supporting the continuation of these. The health promotion unit of my Department is about to commence a new phase of this campaign which will focus on those who buy or supply alcohol to those underage. It comprises of a poster which will be displayed at alcohol outlets nationally and a series of radio messages. The theme is keeping children safe from drink and alerts people to their part in dealing with this problem. This phase will be set in motion shortly and will coincide with the summer holiday season and exam results.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the way in which his Department can justify making charges to medical card holders in long stay nursing homes; the way in which he can justify requiring that medical card holders who require long stay care to seek that care at their own expense in private nursing homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical card holders in receipt of long stay or extended care may be charged under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives shelter and maintenance rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants. The over-riding consideration in applying long-stay charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of long-term care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship. The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is two<Col N="900" /> fold &ndash; firstly, to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes, and secondly, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the Act, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency, as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 to 1998, which set down the requirements for this assessment. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a person will only be entitled to a subvention if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the subvention regulations, 1993.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Ombudsman published a report on the nursing home scheme. The Ombudsman's interpretation of the Health Act, 1970 is that any person in need of nursing home care has a statutory entitlement to be provided with this service by a health board. However, the Department of Health and Children would point out that the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 clearly provided for the establishment of a system of subvention based on means and ability to pay. Nonetheless, it is accepted that the position regarding entitlements in this context is complex and that, in the interest of equity and transparency, it should be made more clear. In this regard, the whole eligibility framework for health services generally is one of the issues to be addressed in the new health strategy currently being prepared by my Department.</P>
    <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home scheme has recently been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. The Deputy will be aware of the shortcomings in the operation of the scheme highlighted in the Ombudsman's report and a number of measures have already been taken to deal with some of these problems. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever further measures may be necessary arising from the findings of this review and the report of the Ombudsman and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

The legal advice to my Department is that under Section 67 of the Health Act, 1970, a health board cannot levy a charge for the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible patients. The proposed scheme was intended as an optional means by which patients on the waiting list could receive a service at an earlier date through a private orthodontist. Patients who wished to avail of free treatment in the public service could of course do so. My Department and the health board are examining all options to tackle the unacceptable waiting lists in orthodontics.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily. The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from the 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As soon as this group has issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed, all boards will be advised accordingly. However, as can be appreciated, the issue of making payments will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>In relation to the particular case raised by the <Col N="904" /> Deputy in his Parliamentary Question of 22 February last, that, as the provision of health services in the Kilkenny area is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board, I asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate and respond directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency. I understand that the board wrote to the Deputy on the 26 February outlining the position in relation to this particular case. As it appears from information provided by the board that the application for subvention in question was refused following an assessment of the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters to contribute to the cost of their parent's care, this case may be eligible to receive moneys on foot of the Minister's decision. I have asked the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board to contact the Deputy directly on this issue.</P>

I have, therefore, asked the chief executive officer at the South-Eastern Health Board, who have responsibility for the provision of services in the case to which the Deputy is referring, to look into the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory control over the conduct of clinical research in this country commenced in 1988 when the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, came into force. This Act laid down strict controls on persons conducting clinical trials in this country. Under the Act, which was amended in 1990, persons proposing to arrange for the conduct of a clinical trial were required to make application to the Minister for Health for permission to conduct the trials. These permissions were granted on the recommendation of the national drugs advisory board. On the coming into force of the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, in January 1996, the Irish Medicines Board became the competent authority for the granting of such permissions.</P>
      <P>The intention of the Act was to provide a framework of control within which the following two objectives could be achieved &ndash; the protection and safeguarding of the right of those participating in clinical trials, and the facilitation of clinical research. The information which must be provided in respect of each application for permission to conduct a clinical trial is laid down in the Act and this information is evaluated by the Irish Medicines Board on the basis of strict criteria. In addition, the approval of the appropriate ethics committee for the trial must also be obtained. Under the Acts it is incumbent on the applicant in making application to identify the proposed ethics committee and to provide the names, addresses and qualification of each member.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board in its examination of applications for permissions also takes into account the appropriateness of the proposed ethics committee and of its proposed composition. Where the board is satisfied that a proposed ethics committee is competent to &ldquo;consider the justification for conducting the proposed clinical trial and the circumstances under which it is to be conducted&rdquo;, it gives its approval for the proposed committee.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 requires that &ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Every person who conducts a clinical trial shall &ndash;</P>
      <P>(a) in respect of any place under his control which the Irish Medicines Board reasonably believes is being or has been used in connection with the trial, permit any person, duly authorised by the Board, to inspect such place for the purpose of determining whether or not the permission to undertake the trial is being or was complied with,</P>
      <P>(b) comply with any request for information in relation to the progress of the trial which the Irish Medicines Board may from time to time request, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> (c) upon becoming aware or suspecting any adverse reaction affecting a participant as a consequence of the trial being conducted, forthwith report that fact to the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>(2) Every person, other than the person conducting the trial, who administers a substance or preparation for the purpose of a clinical trial shall, upon becoming aware or suspecting any adverse reaction as a consequence of the substance or preparation being administered, forthwith report that fact to the person conducting the trial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The permission to conduct a clinical trial, unless previously revoked or varied as to its period of validity, continues in force for a period of two years from the date on which it is granted. In pursuance of section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Act, one of the conditions applicable to the permission is that a report on the progress of the trial shall be made to the Irish Medicines Board on the expiry of the permission.</P>
    <P>The current legislation relating to the control of clinical trials is as follows: Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, Control of Clinical Trials and Drugs Act, 1990 and the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 150 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>The National Traveller Health Advisory Committee, which was established in 1998, has submitted its recommendations for a proposed national Traveller health strategy. The committee's proposals will provide a major input into the national Traveller health strategy which is currently being drafted in my Department with a view to publication within the coming weeks. Upon publication, the strategy will be circulated to health boards who will be asked to draw up plans for the phased implementation of it. The National Traveller Health Advisory Committee will continue to play an important advisory role in relation to the implementation of the strategy following its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> When the strategy is published, the provision of resources for its implementation will be a matter for discussion with the health boards and other interested parties. However, I was pleased to be able to allocate £1 million in revenue funding for new developments in Traveller health services this year which is evidence of this Government's commitment to meeting the needs of this population group.</P>

      <P>The position is that doctors must prescribe all medication for patients in hospitals and nursing homes. Nurses cannot administer any medication without medical direction. Protocols in this regard have not changed recently. However, An Bord Altranais and the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery are jointly undertaking a review of the future involvement of nurses and midwives in the prescribing of medical preparations within agreed protocols. This project will involve identification of best international practice, review of the literature and consultation with the nursing, midwifery and allied professions. The project is scheduled to begin this month and is expected to be completed within three years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 165 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister <Col N="910" /> for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily. The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from the 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department, the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As soon as this group has issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed, all boards will be advised accordingly. However, as you can appreciate, the issue of making payments will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if he will identify all the laboratories here that have the facilities to test stool cultures of patients suspected of E. coli 0157 infection; and the procedure in place to ensure that a possible outbreak of E. coli 0157 here is speedily identified and that the relevant warnings are issued in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Laboratory testing for the presence of E. coli is carried out in the public health laboratories of the health boards. Most of the clinical laboratories in our large hospitals have the capability of testing stool samples for E. coli 0157. While some laboratories test all stools sent in by clinicians, others test only those which are clinically indicated or that are on special request or are samples from children.</P>
      <P>In Ireland there is no statutory requirement to notify cases of E. coli 0157. However, the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, have an enhanced surveillance system in place since 1999. Specialists in public health medicine and area medical officers participate in this system whereby a standard set of information is collected on each case identified, to monitor all cases of E. coli 0157. The information collected includes data on age and sex, clinical data, possible risk factors, and information on possible links between cases. An initial notification is made to the NDSC on the date of the notification of the case to the health board and follow up information is returned when available. An informal system of notification is also in place where specialists in public health medicine report to the NDSC and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, of outbreaks of gastro-enteritis and other infectious intestinal diseases. All outbreaks of foodborne illness are investigated, including suspect VTEC outbreaks that are reported to the FSAI and the NDSC. In an outbreak, specialists in public health medicine convene multidisciplinary outbreak control teams to investigate the outbreak and control the source. If suspect food is identified a traceback will be conducted which may result in a food alert or a public alert being issued, or arranging a product recall, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Ireland does not have a national reference laboratory facility for confirmation of verocytotoxin production, or definitive typing of VTEC, and suspect isolates of VTEC must be sent to the public health laboratory service, Colindale, U.K., for phage typing and confirmatory identification.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Promotion Board, one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, will have a general remit to promote scientific co-operation and links between laboratories, the development of cost-effective facilities for specialised laboratory testing.</P>

    <P>Four cases of brucellosis have been reported to date in 2001. This compares to a figure of eight for the same period of 2000. My Department is not aware of any new measures to monitor the prevalence of brucellosis in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by the genus brucella. It is primarily a bacterial illness of livestock and human infection results from occupational exposure to infected animals or by ingestion of infected milk, dairy products or animal tissue. Symptoms of brucellosis are non-specific and include fever, headache, weakness, profuse sweating, chills, weight loss and generalised aching. The symptoms usually appear within five to ten days. Risk groups are abattoir workers, meat inspectors, farmers and veterinarians. The use of pasteurised milk and prevention of contact with infected cattle, sheep or goats will reduce the risk of infection.</P>

      <P>The current position is that the Registration of Births and Deaths Acts 1863 to 1996 and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make <Col N="915" /> available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled, under statute, to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
      <P>The joint programme of work, aimed at modernising the Civil Registration Service, which is being undertaken by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my Department, involves the review of the entire registration system, including registration law, the structure of registration on a national basis in order to identify the changes necessary to capitalise on the use of modern technology to capture registration information in an electronic format. As part of this programme a consultation document, &ldquo;Bringing Civil Registration into the 21st Century&rdquo; was published and the public were invited to offer their views and opinions on the future shape of the service. As the Deputy may appreciate, there has been a large volume of responses to the consultation document on a range of issues, including access to registration and index data. These responses are currently being collated and analysed. It is expected that decisions will be made over the coming months when all factors are taken into account.</P>
      <P>The civil registration modernisation programme envisages the completion of the pilot programme for a new computerised registration service in March 2002.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme commenced in February 2000. Phase 1 of the programme has commenced in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas and offers free mammography to women aged between 50 and 64 years living in those areas. Based on the 1996 census, it is estimated that there are approximately 140,000 eligible women living within the phase one area of the programme and BreastCheck have recently informed me that up to 20 June 2001, a total of 41,630 women have been invited for screening.</P>
      <P>Screening takes place on an area by area basis. As BreastCheck offers screening to women in the target age group by invitation only, it is not a demand service and if a woman has symptoms she should consult her general practitioner.</P>

Under the current scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittance to a health board extended care facility is based primarily on an assessment of medical need. The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes as provided for <Col N="918" /> in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is twofold &ndash; to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes, and, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the Nursing Homes Act, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency, as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 to 1998, which set down the requirements for this assessment. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a person will only be entitled to a subvention if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the subvention regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>With the exception of persons applying for subvention, following determination by the chief executive officer of a health board under article 4.3 of the subvention regulations, a person must apply for a subvention prior to entering a private nursing home. Article 11.1 of subvention regulations provides that a decision on payment and the amount to be paid, must be advised to the applicant within eight weeks of the completed application. It is also open to a person to request that a board outline the charges to be imposed on a patient prior to admittance to a health board extended care facility.</P>
      <P>I would also like to advise the Deputy that copies of the Statutory Instruments containing all the regulations made under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, including how assets are treated for the purposes of assessing means are available from Government publications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current number of approved hospital consultant posts is not immediately to hand in my Department. I have asked Comhairle na nOspidéal to provide me with this information in relation to both filled and vacant posts and on <Col N="919" /> receipt of this information I will forward it to the Deputy. Figures compiled by Comhairle na nOspidéal indicate that between 1997 and 2000 there has been an increase of 266 new consultant posts.</P>
      <P>In relation to accident and emergency consultant posts, I assume the Deputy is referring to my initiative to help alleviate service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector. The Deputy will be aware that I provided funding of £32 million for this initiative as part of phase one of the national review of bed capacity. The investment package was targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants and 15 consultant anaesthetists.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that it typically takes over 12 months to complete recruitment of a consultant on a permanent basis. In the circumstances, and with a view to increasing as soon as possible the number of consultants working in accident and emergency departments and in anaesthetics, it was agreed with Comhairle na nOspidéal that the additional appointments in these key areas would initially be made on a temporary basis. My Department has been advised by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority that to date, 19 accident and emergency consultants and 12 consultant anaesthetists have been appointed, have been offered, or are being offered, temporary contracts on foot of the decision to recruit additional consultants. It is evident from the above that the initiative has reduced the long lead-in time normally associated with the recruitment of additional consultants. I look forward to continuing progress in these areas over the coming months.</P>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's request for information on the average costs associated with the appointment of a consultant &ndash; including support staff and facilities &ndash; it is very difficult to provide an accurate average cost as each post has its own unique requirements. The number of support staff and the level and type of facilities per consultant will vary depending on many factors including the consultant's speciality, the number of consultants already in post, the number of support staff already in place, and the type and size of the hospital etc. I am not aware of a specific figure for new consultant posts being proposed by medical organisations. However, I am aware of media reports quoting a requirement for 1,000 new posts. Both the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation were members of the Medical Manpower Forum and the report of the forum was presented to Government earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the forum was established to examine and address medical staffing difficulties. The report of the forum sets out proposals for the re-structuring of the medical workforce both in the context of changed work <Col N="920" /> patterns and a consultant delivered service. The Government has noted the recommendations of the report in relation to a consultant-delivered public hospital service and will consider these proposals again in the light of the results obtained from a study on the resource implications &ndash; both staff numbers and financial costs &ndash; which is to be undertaken by a national task force on medical manpower. The establishment of this task force has been approved by the Government. The Government has also approved the commencement of negotiations with the relevant parties on core issues arising from the report, including flexibility/cover arrangements, teamworking, etc. The task force on medical manpower will assess future medical staffing requirements and these proposals will be presented to the Government.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have statistics relating to the ratio of the number of consultants to population internationally but I can inform the Deputy that at 31 December 2000, there were 1,558 approved consultant posts in this country. The estimated population at April 2000 was 3,786,900, thereby giving a ratio of one consultant per 2,431 population.</P>

      <P>Representations concerning the necessity for immediate recourse to risk equalisation in our community-rated voluntary health insurance market have been received from VHI, while contrary representations have also been received from BUPA (Ireland). These representations were made in the context of the passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000.</P>
      <P>I, as my record on the passage of the Bill shows, fully recognise the need to provide for effective risk equalisation in a voluntary health insurance system operated on the principles of community rating and open enrolment. The debate on the Bill, at a number of stages, included consideration of amendments which would have significantly impinged upon arrangements for risk equalisation provided for in the Bill and I was not willing to accept such amendments. As the Bill completed its passage on 20 June, it is intended that the related regulations for a risk equalisation scheme will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for affirmation as soon as possible and I would hope to be in a position to do so during the autumn.</P>

      <P>Two independent sources &ndash; the Building Materials Federation and the Irish Concrete Federation &ndash; have confirmed that there should be sufficient resources of building aggregates in Ireland to implement planned infrastructural investment under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Notwithstanding this position, it is of course open to persons to import stone and building materials from other EU member states and that there is no statutory requirement to request permission from any public agency. A significant volume of building materials and products has traditionally been imported to supplement domestic production in meeting the needs of the construction industry. Such imports help to keep prices of construction products competitive.</P>

    <P>More than 99% of the fines issued under the Act are on the spot fines and more than 85% of these are either for the offence of not having a dog licence or not having a dog under effective control. The low rate of prosecutions for non payment of on the spot fines is due to a large extent to the fact that many local authorities do not pursue payment of the fine if the dog owner takes out a licence within a short period of the issue of the on the spot fine, as the production by the dog owner of a licence in court usually leads to a very low fine. Because of the effect of this in reducing the number of prosecutions taken for non-payment of on the spot fines, it is not possible to give accurate information on how many fines are outstanding or how many of these have been written off as uncollectable.</P>

      <P>Estimated charges to be paid by householders to local authorities towards the cost of domestic waste collection services in 2001 are £47 million.</P>
      <P>In relation to Repak Limited, fees from member businesses, which finance its activities, are estimated at £9 million in 2001. Repak Limited was established by Irish industry in 1997 as a voluntary compliance scheme to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste from the commercial and domestic waste streams, so as to achieve Ireland's recovery and recycling targets under Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. Industry also contributes to the overall costs of funding local authority services through commercial rates and payment of gate fees for waste disposal at landfill.</P>
      <P>The function of Repak Limited is to support the recycling of packaging waste arisings. While its primary role does not relate to packaging waste minimisation, the fees structure applicable to Repak members, based on the quantity and nature of packaging placed on the market, directly incentivises minimisation and reuse of packaging, and reflects the polluter pays principle.</P>
      <P>Revenue generated by Repak Limited has been used in support of segregated household waste collection initiatives in Dublin and of a number of companies engaged in waste recovery activities. Such support effectively lessens the costs incurred by local authorities. Repak Limited is also prepared to make further funding available to assist local authorities throughout the country in the establishment of segregated household waste collection services such as that initiated last year in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that useful progress has been made by Repak Limited in relation to the collection and recovery of packaging waste. Repak's recycling target for 2001 is 200,000 tonnes, which when achieved will more than meet Ireland's EU target for the recovery of 25% of packaging waste in the current year. In effect, manufacturers and retailers of packaging waste are already making a significant contribution to the collection and recycling of this waste through their membership <Col N="928" /> of Repak Limited. As the fees levied by Repak Limited on its members are determined by its operational costs, I have no direct function in this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to household and commercial waste, the 1998 policy statement on waste management, entitled Changing our Ways, recommended that local authorities providing waste collection services should review their approach to charges with a view to introducing weight related charging to the fullest extent possible. Similarly, landfill gate fees should be levied in relation to the quantity of waste accepted for disposal. These approaches reflect considerations of equity and cost efficiency as well as the incentivisation of waste reduction.</P>

      <P>The recently published Recycling Directory of Ireland provides comprehensive information on material recyclers and reprocessors operating in Ireland including, in relation to certain companies, the minimum and maximum volumes which are accepted by them. The directory was produced jointly by NI 2000 in Northern Ireland and the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute in Ireland, with financial assistance from the EU LIFE Environment Programme. I am arranging to have a copy placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EPA is responsible for the provision of statistics on waste management generally. The <Col N="929" /> National Waste Database, 1998, published by the EPA in March 2000 and available in the Oireachtas Library, provides detailed statistics on waste streams in Ireland, including in relation to the recovery of waste.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to a major reduction in reliance on landfill and to the implementation of an integrated waste management approach which will provide the improved infrastructure to deliver our ambitious national recovery and recycling targets over a 15 year period. These targets include: diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill; a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill; the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum; and recycling of 35% of municipal waste.</P>
    <P>While my Department does not have specific figures on the current overall capacity of waste processors, the targets for recovery and recycling set out in the regional and local waste management plans, and reflecting national targets, are likely to require a major increase in national recycling and reprocessing capacity and facilities over the next 15 years.</P>
    <P>In relation to issues concerning the economic viability of recycling and reprocessing, I refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 40 of 30 May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>The latest official data on waste recycling are contained in the National Waste Database Report, 1998, which was published by the Environmental Protection Agency in March 2000. The EPA's estimate is that more than 166,000 tonnes of municipal household and commercial waste was recycled in 1998, giving a recycling rate of 9%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to industrial waste, the EPA's estimate is that almost 2.1 million tonnes was recycled in 1998, representing a recycling rate of 26.6%. Of the estimated construction and demolition waste reported to have been sent to landfill, the EPA estimated that almost 1.2 million tonnes was recycled and used for construction purposes <Col N="930" /> or as landfill cover, giving a recycling rate of 43.3%.</P>
    <P>There are no specific recycling targets set by the EU in relation to these waste streams. However, as outlined in the 1998 policy statement Changing our Ways, overall Government policy on waste management is committed to a significant reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which will deliver ambitious recovery and recycling targets over a 15 year period. These include diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill; a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill; the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum; recycling of 35% of municipal waste; and recycling of at least 50% of construction and demolition waste by 2003, with a progressive increase to at least 2013.</P>
    <P>In relation to the policies the Government is pursuing to achieve these targets, I refer the Deputies to the reply to Questions Nos. 365 and 366 of 3 July 2001.</P>
    <P>With regard to packaging waste, which is a significant element of the household and commercial waste stream already referred to, Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste requires Ireland to achieve a 25% recovery rate for such waste by 1 July 2001, and a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005, with associated recycling targets. Repak Limited was established in 1997 by Irish industry as a voluntary compliance scheme to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, so as to achieve Ireland's recovery and recycling targets under the directive. Fees from member businesses finance the activities of Repak. The company has recently reported the recycling of more than 146,000 tonnes of packaging waste in 2000. Its target for 2001 is 200,000 tonnes which, if achieved, would result in Ireland exceeding the directive recovery target in the current year.</P>
    <P>My Department will liaise closely with Repak Limited and other relevant bodies with regard to the implementation of appropriate measures to support improved recovery of packaging waste and the achievement of Ireland's 2005 directive targets in respect of packaging waste.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to issue such a direction.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages significant private sector investment in national road development: £1 billion of the £4.4 billion, 1999 prices, provided for national road improvements in the NDP is to be sourced from private finance through public private partnership financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the three pilot national roads projects already identified in the plan, the National Roads Authority has announced a <Col N="934" /> further eight PPP schemes for the national roads network. The total construction costs of the 11 schemes is £1.2 billion or 1.5 billion and it is expected that these schemes will attract potential private finance of £700 million or 900 million based on user tolls.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 of the NRA's review 2000 and programme for 2001, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, sets out the key principles established by the NRA for its PPP programme. I am satisfied that these principles, together with the broader policy framework set out in the NDP in relation to public private partnerships, establish a satisfactory framework for the continued development of the NRA's PPP programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has made clear in the NDP its plans for considerably greater use of public private partnerships in the implementation of the current national roads programme. That approach is now being taken forward by the NRA. I am confident that it will improve the efficiency and the speed of delivery of the national roads programme while at the same time ensuring public accountability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>Voted expenditure by my Department on the construction and improvement of roads is estimated at £693.1 million this year. This represents 30.1% of estimated total gross expenditure of £2.2961 billion. In addition, expenditure of £284.7 million is projected to be spent on non-national roads in 2001 from the local government fund.</P>
      <P>In 1980, voted expenditure on grants for public roads amounted to £53.0 million or 18.3% from total gross expenditure of £290.3 million.</P>
      <P>Voted expenditure by my Department on the provision of local authority housing is estimated at £374.6 million this year. This represents 16.3% of estimated total gross expenditure. In addition, £82 million is available to the programme from local authority capital receipts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980 this programme was funded by loans raised by local authorities from the local loans fund. A subsidy towards the cost of meeting the corresponding loan charges was paid by the <Col N="936" /> Department to local authorities rather than direct capital grants as is the case at present. Subject to the above, voted expenditure on the programme in 1980 amounted to £62.1 million or 21.4% as a proportion of total gross expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the foregoing that caution needs to be exercised in the context of comparisons between voted expenditure on different programmes in different years. Other factors make comparisons difficult. These include, but are not limited to, own resources expenditure by local authorities on roads, an increased range of responses to social housing need and changes in the nature and extent of programmes funded through the Department's Vote.</P>

      <P>There are a number of methods for recycling various types of plastics. Plastic beverage containers, referred to as PET containers, first undergo initial shredding and treatment, to <Col N="938" /> stringent specifications, before being reprocessed. The largest European reprocessor of PET containers is located in Ireland. Post-consumer PET is reprocessed at this facility into synthetic fibres that have a wide range of uses. At present only two facilities in Europe, located in France and the Netherlands, undertake the necessary pre-treatment. Accordingly, the recovery of PET containers, involving their separate collection, export for pre-treatment and re-import for reprocessing, has not developed significantly so far in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are a number of operators collecting PET containers and information on these can be found in the recently published Recycling Directory of Ireland, which provides comprehensive information on material recyclers and reprocessors. I am arranging to have a copy of this directory placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>To improve Ireland's recovery and recycling rates generally, it is my intention to pursue a producer responsibility initiative for the collection and recovery of PET containers. My Department has already held initial discussions with relevant stakeholders in this regard.</P>

      <P>A person suffering from brucellosis may apply for an appropriate benefit or allowance from my Department, which administers a number of illness and disability payments to persons who may have diseases or disabilities. These consist of disability benefit, invalidity pension, disability allowance, injury benefit and disablement benefit schemes.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to these payments are subject to the applicant satisfying the general medical criteria which apply and these are prescribed in legislation. In addition, certain PRSI contribution conditions must be met in the case of disability benefit and invalidity pension and for disability allowance a means test must be satisfied.</P>
      <P>The occupational injuries scheme provides entitlement to injury or disablement benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed specifically in legislation, where they have contracted the disease in the course of their employment.</P>

      <P>The establishment of nationwide accessible counselling services for families, through investment in voluntary and community groups providing these services, is a priority objective of the Government's families first approach designed to make families central to policy making and service delivery.</P>
      <P>In line with this commitment my Department administers a scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services, marriage preparation courses, child counselling services in relation to parental separation and bereavement counselling and support services. This year £4.81 million has been provided by the Government for the scheme, an increase of over five times the level of funding available in 1997.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I extended the scheme to cover voluntary organisations providing bereavement counselling and support services. It is my view that voluntary organisations in local communities are best placed to respond to the needs of families coping with this type of major upset or distress in their lives and who require access to counselling and support. Since 1998 an increasing number of organisations providing these family bereavement support services have sought and received grant aid each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Organisations providing specialised bereavement support services which have received significant grant aid under the scheme include: Rainbows which provide a particular type of support for children whose lives are affected by bereavement or parental separation. The Rainbows national office received £110,000 over the period 1999 to 2000. A further 75 Rainbows groups throughout the country received individual grants amounting to £60,999 last year; Solas, a specialised bereavement service for children administered by Barnardos received £70,000 in 2000; <Col N="942" /> Loved Ones of Sea Tragedies who provide a particular type of bereavement support to those affected by sea tragedies and the unique circumstances that might surround such occurrences received £10,000 in 2000, Victim Support is mainly funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The organisation provides a number of services to the victims of crime including a 24 hour helpline. The organisation has provided support for families and relatives of those who have gone missing, as described by the Deputy. Victim Support receive grant aid from my Department in respect of their bereavement counselling and support services.</P>
    <P>This year more than 400 organisations have applied for funding under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling and support services. I expect to announce details of funding under this year's scheme shortly.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in policy in relation to the entitlement of unemployed persons, including those employed in the educational sector, to unemployment benefit or assistance during periods of involuntary unemployment. Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance. The relevant legislation specifies the circumstances in which a person is or is not deemed to be available for and genuinely seeking employment. In applying the legislation, deciding officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality and to the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of existing labour market opportunities. Any person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work is not entitled to an unemployment payment. School wardens and other workers in the educational sector are treated in the same way and are expected to meet the same requirements as other claimants in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal <Col N="943" /> this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>The unemployment benefit scheme is not intended to cater for situations where people are in part-time work and are only available to work on a part-time basis. If a person in part-time employment loses that employment and shows that he or she is available for and seeking but unable to obtain full-time work then there is an entitlement to unemployment benefit for the full week.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>Following proposals drawn up by me, the Government has agreed to the establishment of a new family support agency which will bring together the main programmes and services developed by me since 1997, in line with the commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium. The legislation for the new agency will be published shortly and I intend to bring it to the House for deliberation in the early autumn.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many parents of children with permanent disabilities are extremely frustrated with the questions asked on the disability allowance form; and if he will arrange either for a special form for people with disabilities or a system of transfer from domiciliary care allowance with a minimum of bureaucracy.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The disability allowance scheme administered by my Department replaced the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme which had been administered by the health boards. Some 36,500 people transferred from disabled person's maintenance allowance to DA when the scheme was introduced in 1996. At the end of June there were 56,300 people receiving disability allowance.</P>
      <P>Disability allowance, in common with all social welfare payments claims, must be made in the prescribed manner so that an applicant's entitlement can be determined. In the case of disability allowance the primary conditions for receipt of payment require that the applicant satisfies the relevant medical eligibility criteria and satisfies the means test which applies. Consequently both medical and means information are required from an applicant in the claim form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a customer service perspective, I am very conscious of the need to make claim forms as user-friendly as possible. The disability allowance claim form has been redesigned on several occasions with this in mind. In this regard, my Department operates a disability consultative forum comprised of the main representative organisations and service providers for people <Col N="945" /> with disabilities. They provide feedback and advice to my Department on a wide range of issues, including ones which relate to customer service. They have not identified any specific problems with the questions on the claim form for disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Ongoing efforts are made to ensure that claim forms meet the needs of customers. The disability allowance claim form, among others, was referred last year to a national customer panel of people with disabilities operated by my Department. The majority of the panel members expressed the view that the form was satisfactory and that it was easy to understand. A recent MRBI survey, carried out on behalf of my Department, revealed that 74% of customers found completing application forms to be quite easy and straightforward. The survey included recipients of disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Additionally, my Department will in the near future be undertaking a customer survey of 1,000 disability allowance customers. Two of the survey questions will relate to the completion of the claim form. If problems are identified they will be addressed having regard to the feedback received from this survey.</P>
    <P>Special administrative procedures have been put in place by my Department in respect of children for whom domiciliary care allowance is payable and subsequently apply for disability allowance. The health boards provide my Department with lists of domiciliary care allowance recipients three months in advance of their 16th birthday. Claim forms are automatically issued to the person concerned, their parents or guardians for completion.</P>
    <P>The medical records of domiciliary care allowance recipients are confidential to the relevant health board and are not available to my Department. In addition, the medical criteria for award of disability allowance are different from those governing eligibility for domiciliary care allowance. Consequently, medical certification is required in respect of claims for disability allowance. Virtually all such claims are considered without recourse to medical examination.</P>
    <P>No specific problems regarding these procedures have been brought to the attention of my Department and I am satisfied that they are designed to ensure an efficient and effective service.</P>

      <Quest>if he will clarify the situation in relation to the payment of qualified adult dependant allowances to persons on invalidity pension; when the qualified adult dependant allowance ceases; if a sliding scale exists for invalidity pension as it does for those on unemployment benefit; if not; the reason therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations currently provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for claimants of certain welfare payments where the spouse or partner of the claimant is earning between £70 and £145 per week. The QAA is withdrawn when the spouse or partner's weekly income exceeds £145.</P>
      <P>Prior to April 2000 the arrangement did not apply to invalidity pension. As part of a range of measures in the 2000 budget aimed at improving the position of families where one spouse is in low paid employment, the tapering arrangement was extended to invalidity pension from April 2000.</P>
      <P>The arrangements in relation to invalidity pension differ slightly from unemployment benefit. The reason for this is that the level of QAA varies from one payment to another, so to phase out the payment over the same income range, that is £70 to £145, for all payments, the withdrawal rate varies with the level of QAA. In the case of invalidity pension where the spouse-partner of the pensioner is under 66 years the QAA is reduced by £3.70 for each £5 of income. Where the spouse/partner of the pensioner is over 66 years the QAA is reduced by £4.50 for each £5 of income. In the case of unemployment benefit where weekly earnings are between £70 and £85 the withdrawal rate is £2.50 for each £5 of income. Where the earnings of the spouse/partner exceed £85 per week the QAA is reduced by £3.50 for each additional £5 of income.</P>
      <P>I have also made a number of more recent changes in this area. With effect from last April, I substantially increased the qualified adult allowances and extended the upper income limit from £135 to its current £145. These measures, in tandem with the improvements that have been introduced over previous budgets, will ensure that the impact of increases in earnings are not negated for families where the spouse is the sole earner and in low paid employment.</P>

The scheme is targeted at students from low income families who are participating in third level courses and who, under existing legislation, are not entitled to receive unemployment assistance during the summer months. The financial circumstances of the student's family are taken into account when assessing eligibility. To qualify for the scheme students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to the means test applied to unemployment assistance payments. For the purpose of assessing the weekly means of a student, the gross income of the student's parents is taken into consideration. Allowances are made for income tax, PRSI contributions, superannuation, health insurance and union contributions, mortgage, rent and travel to employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over, as well as to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes, including the electricity-gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence scheme, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 years whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>From October 2000 the free schemes were extended to all persons aged 75 and over, regardless of their income and household composition. In addition, provision was made in budget 2001 to further extend the free schemes to all persons aged 70 years and over from last May.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published by the Policy Institute in April 2000, examines the issue of extending them to include other items of expenditure, including the cost of cable television. The review considers that the schemes, as currently constituted, provide a basic package of necessary household benefits that ensure a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group. It notes that it is not the business of this Department to provide for all socially desirable items of expenditure and recommends that no further goods and services be covered by the free schemes, unless their social benefit is clearly over and above that which can be purchased by increased income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review also commented on the fact that many private companies extend concessions to pensioners in order to increase their business usage, as part of their social aims and as recognition of the value they have received from their <Col N="949" /> customers over the years. It also recommended that no further goods and services be covered by the free schemes. In this regard, following previous requests for concessions on the cost of cable television, my officials wrote to the cable company concerned bringing the demands for such concessions to its attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to the time restrictions on the free travel scheme, these have been a feature of this scheme since its conception. They apply at peak times on city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. They do not apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
    <P>These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
    <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relate to capacity constraints. Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes examines the question of time restrictions and notes that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times.</P>
    <P>The review recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. My Department has written to the Department of Health and Children bringing this recommendation to its attention.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme, in common with the other free schemes operated by this Department, is kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements.</P>

      <Quest>if any provision has been made or is planned for the provision of social insurance credits for women who were forced to retire from the Civil Service on marriage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of social welfare credits is to secure the PRSI entitlements of insured workers, who are temporarily outside the paid workforce for reasons such as unemployment, illness etc. in a manner which is consistent with the continued viability of the <Col N="950" /> social insurance fund. The underlying requirement for entitlement to the award of credited contributions is that a person must have worked previously and paid PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>Where a person has no PRSI contributions paid or credited for more than two full contribution years, they are not allowed to claim credits until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks. Given that the award of credits can give entitlement to a range of social insurance benefits, provided that a certain number of paid contributions have been made, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to have some limitations on such award.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce any changes to the current provisions in regard to the award of social insurance credits for persons in the category referred to by the Deputy. Specific issues in relation to the operation of the former marriage bar in the public service are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Government is committed to extending pension cover to as many categories as possible and as a result more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contribution pension scheme. Measures already introduced include the reduction in the average number of PRSI contributions required for pension purposes to ten and the payment of a special half rate pension for those with pre-53 insurance contributions who cannot satisfy the average contribution test. Pro-rata pensions are also available for people with mixed rate insurance records. These measures are making it easier for people, particularly women, with reduced or broken insurance records to receive a contributory pension.</P>

      <P>Funds allocated to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, are sourced from subheads Q1, Q2, R, S, U and V of my Department's Vote. The total amount allocated under these subheads in 2001 is £51.54 million, compared with £47.99 million in 2000. This represents an increase of 7% over the 2000 allocation. I am satisfied the resources at my disposal will enable me to implement the provisions of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.</P>

      <P>Work is progressing as follows at the sites in question in the order referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>1.Major upgrade of visitor facilities at the site. Works are being undertaken by private contractors and will be completed in July 2001 at a cost of £941,000.</P>
      <P>2.Some minor safety works are ongoing. The main conservation works programme is still hampered by foot and mouth restrictions as the main access is across private farm lands. However, I am hopeful that progress can begin to be made in the near future. The work force of my Department will undertake this project. The project is estimated at £300,000 and is scheduled for completion in 2003.</P>
      <P>3.At present all available scaffolding is in use. Owing to the foot and mouth disease restrictions placed on farmland, progress generally on works to rural sites has been held up. In the interim, sites unaffected by the restrictions &ndash; urban sites, are receiving priority so that it will be sometime before this site can be reached. Present indications are that this will be September at the earliest. The work force of my Department will undertake this project. The inspection and initial safety works are expected to cost less than £2,000.</P>
      <P>4.Works to a culvert at the access road are currently being delayed due to foot and mouth disease restrictions. These works will be completed this year. The work force of my Department will undertake this project. The estimated cost is approximately £1,000.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that for the past four months it has been impossible to open the main door of Reginald's Tower; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that this, together with the absence of fire drill procedures, contribute a danger to the public and staff; if she will investigate the delay in repairing a door; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two doors to the ground floor of Reginald's Tower; the original door, which is on the north side, away from the river, and the south door, which is a later 16th century insertion, facing the river. Both of these doors have been in use for visitors but because of noise, dust and wind, the guides requested that consideration be given to the fixing of an inner door to the quayside opening.</P>
      <P>To preserve as much light as possible, a glass door was designed and ordered from a manufacturing firm. Carpenters from Dúchas, The Heritage Service of my Department, installed a timber subframe and a template was sent to this firm. The design was based on a complex survey, which incorporated a number of factors; the floor of the tower slopes unevenly outwards, the sides of the door opening are neither parallel nor vertical, the opening is within a circle and neither side of the opening is at 90 degrees to the inner wall, the arch over the opening is irregular in profile, the arch slopes irregularly to the outside, and there was only one point where the required width and height could be achieved within the opening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The door, which was installed on 10 April 2001, was designed on the basis of the survey. This was perfect, apart from one arch stone which protrudes downwards from the general contours of the opening and prevents the door from opening fully. The choices were to break off the 50 millimetres by which the stone is proud or to adjust the door. As the arch dates from the 16th century, within a 12th century tower, the second option was preferred. Officials from my Department visited the site to consider possible options and decided to investigate re-configuring the glazing. A local contractor agreed to do this, but sub<Col N="957" /> sequently advised that this was not possible, as the glass was toughened after cutting to shape.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers have since agreed to meet on site but a mutually convenient time has yet to be arranged. It is likely that either the door spring and base will be lowered by the required amount or a new glass door with a fixed overhead panel obtained and fitted within the existing fittings. Neither option would be costly, as the greatest cost in this was in the fittings themselves.</P>
    <P>The difficulty experienced with this door arises out of the complexity of the location and the difficulty in applying modern construction within a medieval building. The preparatory work was done with great care and the one &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; stone was not apparent until the door was fitted. The manufacture of the door was done to a high standard.</P>
    <P>While ideally the tower should be open to the quayside as well as to the north, the site is operating satisfactorily with one door. It is regrettable that nearly three months have elapsed but it is clear that the project has been receiving considerable attention from the staff of Dúchas. In the circumstances, where public access to the site was not restricted and given the very wide responsibilities of Dúchas, it was not considered to be a top priority.</P>
    <P>I consider health and safety issues to be of paramount importance for both staff and visitors to our sites. Fire safety equipment at Reginald's Tower is inspected annually and is kept in service. Guide staff receive training in the use of this equipment. The health and safety adviser of my Department is currently reviewing health and safety procedures and I will ensure that recommendations made are acted upon. Pilot fire and emergency plans, which will serve as models for other sites, have been drawn up for a number of locations and these are in the process of being assessed.</P>

      <P>The Habitats Directive requires member states to propose relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation for the conservation of listed habitats and species, and to protect their favourable conservation status. It also requires member states to transmit a list of the proposed areas together with full information on each site to the EU Commission. The directive specifies scientific criteria for the selection of these areas. The directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> A total of 362 sites have been publicly proposed for designation and receive protection in Irish law from the date of public notification in each case. I have now transmitted all 362 candidate special areas of conservation to the EU Commission in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Habitats Directive. My Department is also examining the question of proposing a final additional batch of cSACS for salmon.</P>
    <P>Apart from the aforementioned additions, however, I have no plans to add to this list in advance of the Atlantic Region Biogeographical Seminar currently scheduled for September 2001. This seminar will be asked to assess our proposals for SACs in the light of currently available scientific information.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for the certification of film projects under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, formerly section 35 of the Finance Act 1987, as amended.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have on a number of occasions visited Los Angeles to meet the senior executives in the American film industry to promote Ireland as a location for film production. These visits have raised the profile of Ireland as such a location with the major film companies. US investment in the Irish film industry since 1997 has involved a spend in Ireland of more than £110 million. Most recently, I have visited the Cannes film festival with the same objective.</P>
      <P>Since July 1997, 127 film projects have been certified under the section 481 scheme to date, and seven applications are currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>Following on the report of the film industry strategic review group, significant initiatives have been put in place to revitalise and strategically re-orientate this important area of the economy. These include the consolidation and unprecedented extension of the section 481 tax relief for investors in the industry, which will now run until April 2005.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act, 2000, which had the effect of raising the overall limit of expenditure which may be incurred by the board in production and development funds, from £30 million to £80 million, was signed into law in December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Irish Film Board will be pivotal in future developments in the sector. I was pleased to have obtained significant increases in the financial and staffing resources of the board in recent months. Since I took office, the Exchequer allocation for the Irish Film Board has <Col N="959" /> increased from £4.2 million in 1997 to £8.75 million. This represents a 100% increase in funding for the board. Staffing resources have been increased from five in 1997 to the current level of 16. With these improved inputs, the restructured board will be well placed to strategically drive the sector over the next five years.</P>

      <P>The National Monuments Acts 1930-1994, is the main instrument for the protection of the built heritage. The legislation provides <i>inter alia</i> for the establishment of the Record of Monuments and Places, RMP, which affords legal protection to more than 120,000 archaeological sites and monuments in that where works are proposed to a site included in the RMP &ndash; my Department requires two months written notice of the proposals. The legislation also affords me powers to make preservation orders for sites that are under immediate threat of injury or destruction. Notwithstanding the comprehensive nature of this legislation, I have commenced a review aimed at its updating and consolidation to take account of the new threats and challenges that are facing our built heritage as we head into a new millennium. The review has already gone through a public consultation phase and draft heads of a new Bill have been circulated to Departments.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have also taken measures to protect the built heritage. Among these for the archaeological heritage have been; the publication and application of two policy documents, &ldquo;Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Policy and Guidelines on Archaeological Excavations&rdquo;, the doubling of the archaeological staff in my Department, thus enabling me to improve services in key areas such as archaeological licensing and in advising on and devising, mitigation strategies in relation to, planning and development impacts. My Department has agreed a code of practice with the National Roads Authority and similar codes with other development sectors are in the course of advanced discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the protection of the architectural heritage, among the measures have been; the introduction in January 2000, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, which strengthened the protection of the architectural heritage of Ireland. Under this Act, primary responsibility for protection of the architectural <Col N="960" /> heritage rests with the planning authorities; my role in the process is mainly advisory, the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage was given a statutory footing under new legislation that I brought forward in 1999, the introduction of the aforementioned new legislation also saw the establishment in my Department of a new division that has responsibility for compiling the NIAH and making appropriate recommendations to the planning authorities. The division also provides expert advice in the form of guidelines on acceptable works to structures included in the record of protected structures and advising on proposed developments that impact on protected structures. In November last year, I announced details of a £100 million investment programme in the built heritage under the national development plan. This includes some £80 million for capital works to the some 750 national monuments and historic properties and sites in my care.</P>
    <P>Given that most risks to our important built heritage sites come from development pressures, my Department works with the planning and other regulatory authorities to ensure that legitimate development needs are balanced with heritage protection. Where, however, there is an undue threat to the built heritage I can have recourse to the protective mechanisms in the national monuments Acts, and these are invoked as required.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Heritage Council, I am pleased that I have been able to increase funding for the council by 167% since July 1997 to a level of £7.986 million in the current year. I am satisfied the protection of the built heritage has been considerably strengthened since I took office in June 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 258 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The red grouse is a localised resident species which is generally confined to various types of peatlands including raised bog, blanket bog, and wet and dry heath where it feeds on heather. Since the 1920s there has been a marked decrease in the population because of loss of heather peatland habitat due to turbary-mechanised peat extraction, afforestation, overgrazing, burning <Col N="961" /> and because of the decline in the number of areas managed as grouse shoots.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general population of the species, the red grouse is a red-listed species, that is, given the highest concern rating, on the Irish birds of conservation concern report, compiled by BirdWatch Ireland, because its population has declined by more than 50% in the last 25 years. The <i>New Breeding Atlas 1988-1991</i> shows a loss of 66% of all 10 km squares occupied during the first atlas, 1968-1972. Although there are some concerns about the level of coverage in the Republic during the second atlas, these results have been interpreted to mean that there has been a range decline of at least 50% during this period. The best general estimate for the species is in the range of 1,000 to 5,000 pairs.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, active raised bog, blanket bog and heath are the main habitats used by grouse. I have proposed 127 heath or bog sites as CSACS, candidate special areas of conservation sites, as an important habitat protection initiative which should be of benefit to the grouse. It is not possible to give an estimate of grouse on each site.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I should inform the Deputy that habitat management is also being undertaken through the commonage framework plans prepared jointly by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. These plans seek to set sustainable stocking rates, which will aid vegetation recovery and provide further benefits for the grouse. Other initiatives of relevance to the concerns raised by the Deputy include the rural environment protection scheme, promoted by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and local initiatives are also carried out by the national association of regional game councils, NARGC, in a number of areas in the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>While there is little doubt that floodlighting can often enhance and give dramatic effect to a building the question of whether specific buildings are floodlit is a matter in the first instance for the owner of the property concerned to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to national monuments, the position is that my officials are finalising a set of formal guidelines/criteria which will be applied to all requests for floodlighting at national monuments <Col N="964" /> sites. I expect work on this document to be completed by the end of August with a view to it being published in the autumn.</P>
    <P>With regard to possible funding of floodlighting projects, the Deputy will be aware that funding available to my Department in respect of national monuments is primarily earmarked for use at the approximately 750 sites in State care. Given the range of pressures in relation to conservation works at these sites floodlighting would not be a top priority in the drawing up of work programmes or in the allocation of funds. Bearing this in mind, the question of the possible floodlighting of Tagadoe round tower and church will be considered once the guidelines are published.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in my reply of 8 March 2001, Parliamentary Question No. 135, the feral goats in the Burren National Park are not the property of my Department. They are rather the responsibility of the landowner on whose lands they are found. Feral goats are wild animals but are not a protected species for which I have responsibility under the wildlife Acts.</P>
      <P>In the context of the recent alert in relation to foot and mouth disease, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has been in ongoing consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development regarding the implications of the situation for all wildlife, including feral goats. While I understand that feral goats can contract foot and mouth disease and carry the disease, veterinary advice from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was that no action was necessary in relation to these animals. Consequently, no assessment of the health status of these animals, in the context of the foot and mouth disease scare, was made by my Department.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise, however, that it is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the local district veterinary offices to carry out disease testing on goats in the Burren National Park and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office survey to which the Deputy refers was, in terms of scale, the first nationwide survey of its kind to be carried out in this jurisdiction and it was conducted with both rigour and comprehensiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out, however, that the CSO itself drew attention to the fact that &ldquo;the survey results are not directly comparable with crime statistics published in the Garda Síochána annual report, as there are fundamental differences in sources, definitions and classification methodology&rdquo;. It is also worth noting that the CSO has highlighted <Col N="967" /> that the survey data are subject to sampling variation and that some of the results should be interpreted with extreme caution. Moreover, neither the crime categories nor the time frame of the survey permit direct comparison with the Garda statistics. In simple terms, therefore, we are not comparing like with like, and this is always crucial when contrasting any two data sets if robust conclusions are to be drawn.</P>
    <P>The main benefit of surveys such as that by the CSO is to identify trends which may emerge over time. Unfortunately, there is little recent comparable work. There is no evidence to suggest that the level of under-reporting of crime has altered in recent years.</P>
    <P>My Department and the national crime council are considering the results of the CSO survey, including the possibility of commissioning further victimisation surveys.</P>

    <P>*Portlaoise holds subversive prisoners with all of the attendant additional costs. Cloverhill and Midlands Prisons were not fully operational during 2000 and have been excluded from the table. The average cost of keeping an offender is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders in those institutions. These items include certain items which are fixed no matter what the number of offenders in custody, for example, staffing number, light and heat.</P>
    <P>The cost outturn for 2000 is currently subject to the annual audit of Vote 21 &ndash; Prisons &ndash; by the Comptroller and Auditor General. When looking at the cost of keeping an offender it should be borne in mind that this figure is for keeping a person in custody, with all of the entailed costs, such as medical, educational and recreational, for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year. It is, therefore, not really comparable with other types of institutions. The ratio of staff to offender by institution on 3 July 2001 was as follows:</P>

      <P>Details in relation to the number of offences where proceedings commenced under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, for the years 1995 to 1999 are published in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Statistics on the number of offences where proceedings commenced for the year 2000 are currently being compiled for publication in the Garda Síochána's annual report, which will become available in due course.</P>
      <P>With regards to the Garda Commissioner's reported remarks, I wish to inform the Deputy that the figure quoted represents the sum of a variety of offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended, from October 2000 to March 2001 and that comparable figures are not available for the same period in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána's Operation Oíche has proven highly effective and that recent legislative and other measures in relation to intoxicating liquor and juvenile justice will pay <Col N="970" /> dividends. Moreover, the national crime council is undertaking a major research project in relation to public order offences, which should significantly enhance the information available to us about the nature and patterning of this problem. In addition, the Garda Commissioner has brought together a group to provide expert advice on the particular factors which appear to be at work in the manifest tendency towards violence in certain instances among young people.</P>

    <P>*Ashbourne, which was previously in Balbriggan district, was established as a separate district headquarters in July 1998. From that date also, Dunboyne and Dunshaughlin stations, which were previously in Trim district, have been in the Ashbourne district. Local Garda management is satisfied that the arrangements currently in place are adequate to meet the policing needs of the area. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of County Meath will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to by the Deputy, in common with other major urban areas, has a number of drug users. The Garda have made 20 drugs seizures in the area to date in 2001, four of which were made in the context of section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>While all members of the Garda Síochána have a role to play in combating both the supply and demand for drugs, four members of the Garda Síochána are dedicated to crime-drug prevention and investigation in the area. In addition, community Garda and juvenile liaison officers concentrate on reducing the demand for drugs, particularly through contact with schools and youth groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of drug treatment centres is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. However, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has advised me that he is informed by the North-Eastern Health Board, NEHB, that from 1997 to 2000 their figures show an increase of approximately 140 persons seeking drug treatment in the entire NEHB functional area. It is suggested that this increase is due to a decrease in those accessing treatment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and a much improved service in the north-east. The following table outlines treatment trends for NEHB clients.<Col N="973" /></P>

    <P>The Minister for Health and Children further informs me that the number of staff working in the area of drug misuse has increased considerably. The NEHB now provides an outreach service which aims to enhance the capacity of young people, parents and communities to respond to drug issues as well as a one-to-one service. It also provides a comprehensive counselling service and a methadone detoxification service. In addition it has developed linkages and entered into arrangements with treatment and research facilities.</P>
    <P>In this context linkages have been made with, among others, community and voluntary groups, general practitioners, local authorities, FÁS and the VEC. The entire drugs programme is co-ordinated by a multi-agency group, formed in 1999, and will be strengthened by the establishment of a regional drugs task force in the area as recommended in the recently published national drug strategy.</P>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board has advised the Minister for Health and Children that there are insufficient numbers to justify the establishment of a drug care unit at present, but that the development of drug services is constantly kept under review to take account of any emerging trends.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that &ldquo;Operation Oíche&rdquo; has been very successful in focusing attention on and promoting a proactive approach to public order and alcohol related issues within the Dublin region. A more visible Garda presence on the streets has been apparent to members of the public, particularly following public house and nightclub closings at weekends.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that, since the introduction of the operation on 9 October 2000, a total of 24,217 public order and intoxicating liquor related offences have been detected in the Dublin metropolitan region. In particular, I understand that there has been high arrest levels under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.</P>

      <Col N="974" /> I am further informed that &ldquo;Operation Oíche&rdquo; has been extended for a further period of time and that the Garda authorities have made a decision to intensify activity, particularly with regard to the detection of the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor to under-age persons. In this respect, members of the Garda Síochána are paying frequent visits to licensed premises to enhance awareness of licensees' responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that &ldquo;Operation Oíche&rdquo; has proven to be very effective to date and that its high visibility, proactive approach has acted as a strong deterrent to possible offenders.</P>

      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 1999 (SI No. 4 of 1999) provide for a voluntary national age card scheme whereby any person who has attained 18 years of age may apply for an age card at his/her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square has been given responsibility, under the regulations, for the issuing of the cards.</P>
      <P>Subsection 4(3) of the regulations provides that an application to a member of the Garda Síochána for an age card must be accompanied by the applicant's birth certificate, at least one other document which confirms the identity of the applicant, two recent identical passport sized photographs of the head and shoulders of the applicant and the fee prescribed in the second schedule to the regulations. The form of the document confirming identity, which is to accompany the applicant's birth certificate, is not prescribed in the regulations.</P>
      <P>Subsection 4(4) of the regulations provides that where the member in charge is satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and that he or she has attained 18 years of age, the member will proceed to authenticate the application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that existing statutory provisions are adequate to deal with incidents of public disorder. In addition to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, numerous statutes contain provisions dealing with behaviour associated with public disorder, such as the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990 and Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, I am confident that the Children Bill, 1999, which recently passed all stages in the Oireachtas, will have a significant effect in preventing the committal of public order offences by young people. On a related matter, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, significantly strengthened the provisions against the sale or supply of <Col N="981" /> intoxicating liquor to underage persons. To complement this, the age card scheme, which I launched last year, allows any person who has reached the age of 18 years to apply for an age card at his/her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>In summary, I am satisfied that existing legislation is adequate and effective, although the situation is, of course, kept under ongoing review.</P>

      <P>I should mention to the Deputy that since the introduction of the Circuit Court private practitioner pilot project which involves the use of private solicitors in divorce and judicial separation cases in the participating law centres of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Finglas, there has been a substantial reduction in the waiting times in these law centres.</P>

      <P>Arising out of this review, I am happy to inform the Deputy that I will shortly make a statutory instrument which will increase the level of allowances and disposable income allowed for a person to be financially eligible for legal services.

      <P>The Deputy will further appreciate that under sections 24 and 28 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Legal Aid Board is also obliged to apply a merits test to the subject matter of an applicant's case, that is, the case must have a reasonable prospect of success if pursued through the courts and the subject matter of the case must not be excluded under the Act, respectively.</P>

      <P>The general position in respect of non-EEA nationals who are legally employed in the State and who wish to be joined here by visa required family members is that the worker in question must have been in the State for a period of 12 months and have the expectation of remaining here for at least a similar period before he or she can be joined here.</P>
      <P>The persons in question are visa required family members of a person who has been legally employed here since January 2001. They would not, therefore, qualify for admission in order to reside here on the above basis. They applied for a visit visa earlier this year but were refused because my Department was not satisfied that they would observe the terms of the visit visa and in particular that they would return within the required time frame.</P>

      <P>In response, a number of companies submitted proposals which were examined by the Office of Public Works and the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA. Arising from this examination, the RIA placed a contract with East Coast Catering Ireland Limited for the provision of such a facility at Balseskin, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>The facility in question will be a low-rise accommodation centre, modelled on similar facilities used extensively throughout Europe. The site has not been purchased by the State and the company in question has entered into a fixed term &ndash; three years &ndash; contract for the provision of the accommodation and ancillary services. It is envisaged that construction will be completed in mid-December 2001.</P>
      <P>The residents of this centre will be accommodated on a direct provision basis, full board and lodgings will be provided to them. Full health and social welfare services will be provided on site and schools will be sourced based on available capacity. A school bus service will be arranged as appropriate. The terms of the contract also require the contractor to put in place recreational facilities to cater for adults, children and mothers and children.</P>

      <Quest>the regulations in relation to a non-national who has worked here under a work permit for five years with the one employer and is seeking other work as the employer has withdrawn from the country; if this person must get another work permit; if, after five years having a work permit and paying tax, this person's status has improved; if this person can continue to work without a permit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Matters relating to the granting of work permits as well as labour migration generally are the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Deputy's question pertains to more general immigration matters, the position is <Col N="987" /> that Irish immigration law does not contain any provision for granting a special status to persons on the basis of a particular length of residence. However, an administrative practice exists whereby a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may at his or her discretion grant permission to remain to a person for a five year period where that person has already resided legally in the State for five years. That permission does not, however, obviate the necessity to obtain a work permit or a visa if required.</P>
    <P>It is also of course open to a person to apply for naturalisation, provided he or she fulfils the necessary conditions, one of which is that he or she has resided in the State for five years in the preceding nine year period, including the year immediately prior to the making of the application. As a naturalised Irish citizen, the person would of course no longer be subject to Irish immigration requirements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322, 323 and 325 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues involved in the industrial action by members of the ASTI were examined in great <Col N="991" /> detail by the Labour Court which issued recommendations for a resolution of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The ASTI rejected the Labour Court recommendations and has deferred consideration of future action on their 30% pay claim until September.</P>
    <P>At the Labour Court, the parties agreed to enter into discussions on the issues of supervision and substitution in order to have the matters resolved this summer. Following their rejection of the Labour Court recommendations the ASTI has refused to engage in discussions on these issues. In an effort to avoid further difficulties in September my Department has entered into negotiation with the other teacher unions on the issues of supervision and substitution. These negotiations are on going. Any arrangements for the payment of teachers for supervision and substitution work arising from these discussions will be available to all teachers.</P>
    <P>The Teachers Conciliation Council, which is the agreed forum for discussing pay and conditions of teachers, has continued to operate throughout the present dispute. However, the issue of the ASTI pay claim has not been discussed since the matter was referred to the Labour Court. The Government accepted the Labour Court recommendation and considers that the application of the pay terms of the PPF together with the review of teachers' pay being currently being undertaken by the Public Service Benchmarking Body is the only way in which the ASTI pay claim can be addressed.</P>

      <P>In view of the early stage which the amalgamation proposal is at, I am not in a position to give the type of confirmation sought by the Deputy in relation to the staffing allocation for the school in question. The school authority has been assured that no permanent teacher employed in the school will be compulsorily redeployed before the amalgamation takes place. In addition, my Department has been, and will continue to be, prepared to consider an application from the school authority for concessionary teachers to deal with particular curricular difficulties which may arise in the school.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to arrest the downturn in participation in science subjects at second level and science graduates of third level who are leaving the education sector for industry and the private sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>At second level, science is taught as a single subject in the junior cycle and as five separate subjects in the senior cycle. In the junior cycle the uptake of science has remained fairly constant for a number of years at just under 90% of the cohort. At senior cycle the uptake of agricultural science has been increasing somewhat, albeit from a fairly low base. However, the uptake of biology has been decreasing in recent years, while the uptake of the physical sciences has been on the decrease for a number of years.</P>
      <P>In the context of initiatives to increase the uptake of the physical science subjects at second level my Department is implementing a range of measures that are designed to make these subjects more attractive to students.</P>
      <P>Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 for first examination in June 2002. As well as the addition of new, up-to-date content these syllabi have an increased emphasis on student practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society. These changes are intended to highlight for students the relevance of these subjects to their everyday lives.</P>
      <P>A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science was introduced in last year's examination. In leaving certificate physics and chemistry the structure and layout of questions on the ordinary level papers has been revised. These changes have been designed to make these examination papers more accessible to the cohort of candidates for whom they are intended.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was put in place in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years. The programme has received a very enthusiastic response from teachers and will make a major contribution to reinvigorating the teaching of these subjects at both junior and senior level.</P>
      <P>The in-career development programme includes the provision of support materials for teachers. In addition to these materials, my Department has produced comprehensive reference handbooks in both physics and chemistry and has distributed them to all second level schools. These handbooks have been provided in both printed and CD-ROM formats. In addition to the copies sent to schools, individual teachers are being provided with further copies of the CD as part of the in-career development programme. These materials have a particular emphasis on practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 2000, schools offering the physical sciences received a capital grant of £4,000. Of this, £1,500 was designated for the purchase of basic laboratory equipment while the remainder was designated for the purchase of a PC and associated hardware and software specifically for use in the science laboratory. At the end of last year schools received a further capital grant of £6,500. <Col N="995" /> This was intended primarily for the purchase of data-logging equipment.</P>
    <P>As well as these capital grants, an additional annual <i>per capita</i> grant for each student studying the physical sciences at leaving certificate level was introduced in the school year 1999-2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> At third level, there is a need to ensure that a sufficient number of science graduates remain within the education sector upon graduation. In this regard, the following table shows the latest figures from the Higher Education Authority's First Destination of Awards Recipients in Higher Education (1999) report.</P>

    <P>This is one of the issues which will be addressed by the task force on the physical sciences which I recently set up. The brief of the task force is to devise and recommend additional measures to improve participation rates in physics, chemistry and related courses at second and third level. Two full-time national science strategy co-ordinators have been appointed to assist the task force in its work, from second and third level respectively. It is expected that the task force will produce an interim report shortly and a final report early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular payscale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed under this scheme are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with <Col N="997" /> effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment to date in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and was further increased in this year's estimates to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>The most significant indication of the Government's commitment to supporting schools in this area was the announcement yesterday that an additional £46 million, over and above the amounts referred to above, is being allocated for ancillary services in primary and post primary schools. Under this initiative £46 million spent by FÁS on school services under community employment schemes will be transferred by an Tánaiste from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to my Department. This will include increased grant assistance for secretarial and caretaking services. The transfer of funds will be front loaded with £32 million being transferred in the next school year and the balance during 2003. My Department will be issuing further details and guidelines to schools in relation to this increased allocation.</P>
    <P>The progress made by the Government in this area will make substantive and equitable funding available for caretaking and secretarial services in our primary and post primary schools.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE the Government has agreed that £46 million spent by FÁS on school services under CE will be transferred to the Department of Education and Science. These funds will be used to provide a significant increase in grant assistance for ancillary services in primary and post primary schools. The transfer of the funds will be front loaded with £32 million being transferred in the next school year and the balance during 2003.</P>
      <P>My Department will prepare guidelines for schools on the new arrangements and the purposes for which schools can use the increased funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main features of the new arrangements are increased funding for secretarial and caretaking services for schools and greater flexibility for schools in how these services are provided. All schools, including those who have never benefited from CE funding, will receive additional funding; all people on CE schemes who opt to <Col N="999" /> serve out their contracts will be facilitated and a liaison group will be established, comprising representatives of FÁS and DES, to facilitate a smooth transition.</P>

      <P>My Department's records indicate that the person referred to by the Deputy has restricted recognition to teach in special schools and in special classes in ordinary national schools. This form of recognition ensures that while this person is teaching in such a capacity, he is remunerated at the salary rate applicable to a teacher with full recognition. Teachers with such recognition are entitled to teach in special classes for children with autism or autistic spectrum disorders.</P>
      <P>My officials are not aware of any recent correspondence in relation to this matter. However, as the person has restricted recognition to teach, at full salary, in the type of class referred to by the Deputy, it would appear that the question of recognition of this teacher's qualifications has already been addressed.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 338 and 339 together.</P>
      <P>In deciding to establish a scheme whereby survivors of abuse can receive financial awards from public funds, the Government decided that it should be directed at those who as children were abused in institutions in which they were resident and for which the State had significant regulatory or supervisory responsibility. Section 2 of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill provides that institutions for the purposes of the Bill include industrial schools, reformatory schools, orphanages or children's homes in which children were resident and in respect of which a public body had responsibilities relating to inspection or regulation. Children in these institutions either did not have parents or were separated from them for very lengthy periods. In either case they did not have the care and protection which children in the care of their parents normally enjoy. The care and welfare of the children concerned therefore was dependent to an unusual degree on public bodies carrying out their duty to protect them. It is clear that, notwithstanding that duty, children suffered abuse. These considerations do not apply to children who were resident with their families, either while at school or who remained within the care of their families while attending hospital. The State's moral and legal duties in respect of such children were and are much different. In the circumstances it is not proposed to extend the terms of the Bill as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has increased from 84 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 86 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and three mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year which is the same staffing as the school has for the 2000-01 school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the school has the services of a shared learning support teacher.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Civil Service regulations in relation to travel and subsistence expenses are of general application. Where issues arise in relation to an interpretation of these regulations, the Department of Finance is consulted. At the point when the Deputy raised this question, 23 June 2000, the process of consultation with the Department of Finance had not been concluded. Subsequently, this process was concluded and the officer in question was notified recently, through her union, that payment of the expenses sought did not come within the regulations.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) was deemed by the consistory of senior officers of his Department as being unsuitable for promotion on seniority in June-July 1999; the further reason the Department's assessment was suddenly reversed; the reason the officer was not told that the record was going to be contradicted; if his attention has been drawn to the ongoing effect of his Department's action on the health of the officer concerned; the reason no attempt has been made to explain his Department's action in the 12 months since; the action he will take to make good the situation and render the record consistent; his views on whether his Department's advice that the officer should contact a charity to provide for her family to be an adequate response; and when moneys due to the officer for some considerable time will be paid.</Quest>

      <P>The consistory process involves all of the senior managers of the Department forming a view as to the suitability of an individual officer for promotion. Each consistory operates by way of a full review of an officer's suitability for a higher grade in the light of all relevant factors including the most up to date assessment by that officer's managers. It is open to any officer to seek detailed feedback in relation to the decisions of the consistory. A detailed letter was sent to the officer on 5 July 2000 in this matter and most <Col N="1003" /> recently, a further communication was sent to the officer's union representative in relation to the position. Officials of my Department's personnel unit are available to give full feedback to this officer in an appropriate and confidential setting.</P>
      <P>My Department's personnel unit has no knowledge of the reference to charity made by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There are no outstanding payments due to the officer under the regulations.</P>

      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. The NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational <Col N="1005" /> supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible</P>
    <P>To progress this case further a questionnaire issued to the child's parents on 30 May 2001 which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with their written permission to contact schools and the NEPS on behalf of this child. To date, the relevant section of my Department has not received the completed questionnaire.</P>

      <P>The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, comprehensive and community schools and voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> grant basis. Financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant, which also covers the VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme. Community and comprehensive schools are funded on a budget basis. Schools have considerable discretion as to how this funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils and schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to chaplains, the position at present is that my Department allocates <i>ex quota</i> posts of chaplain, to deed of trust-type community schools and colleges, which arise from amalgamations and greenfield developments. The deeds of trust <Col N="1008" /> for such schools specifically provide for the appointment of a chaplain on an <i>ex quota</i> basis.</P>

      <P>The Central Applications Office is a company limited by guarantee which was established in 1976 to accept applications for admission to undergraduate courses in higher education institutions in Ireland. It is an organisation representative of higher education interests and is controlled entirely and jointly by them. I have no function in relation to the operation of the CAO. However, the CAO has kindly supplied the following information in relation to the Deputy's inquiry.</P>
      <P>All closing dates are set by the board of directors of the CAO after widespread consultation with the higher education institutions and other relevant bodies such as the Institute of Guidance Counsellors. The policy of fixed-date deadlines was set 22 years ago as it was believed that this would avoid any confusion that could arise if dates were changed from year to year. For example, for two decades it has been widely known that 1 February each year is the closing date for receipt of applications. In 11 of those 22 years, one or more of the CAO deadlines has fallen on either a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday.</P>
      <P>With regard to the current year, all applicants were supplied with change of mind documents by 8 May, giving them almost two months in which to take action. Deliveries could be, and were, made to the CAO on Saturday, 30 June, and Sunday, 1 July. Documents arriving in the post on Monday, 2 July were treated as being on time.</P>
      <P>The closing date of 1 July should not present difficulties to students wishing to consult colleges. Each year from September onwards higher education institutions devote substantial resources to providing potential students with all relevant information. Applicants are advised on numerous occasions to research their choices fully and in good time.</P>
      <P>The CAO has indicated that any change to a policy which has worked satisfactorily for almost a quarter of a century would require the most careful consideration by their board of directors. They also indicated that there could be very considerable confusion if a deadline that has been widely known for many years to fall on 1 July were suddenly changed to, for example, 29 June.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the comprehensive survey of all primary schools, which was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000 at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Almost 75% of primary schools responded to the survey with completed survey questionnaires.</P>
      <P>A number of accepted socio-economic variables, were used to compute an index of disadvantage for each school surveyed. These variables included unemployment, medical card possession and residence in local authority housing which have been found in the past to be valid indicators of disadvantage at school level. Separate indices were used for rural and urban schools to reflect the findings of previous research that showed that educational disadvantage manifests itself differently in urban and rural locations. Participating schools were ranked in order of the number of disadvantaged pupils enrolled.</P>
      <P>The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need and the findings form the basis of the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I announced earlier this year to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. The programme involves expenditure of £26 million over a three-year period including the allocation of over 200 new teacher posts and supplementary funding to primary schools with concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports must be targeted at the disadvantaged pupils in each school. The programme has both an urban and rural phase and the allocation of resources on a 3:1 basis between the two is consistent with the survey finding in relation to the distribution of educationally disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme. More than 2,300 primary schools are benefiting under the programme based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the ERC survey. The names of the schools already deemed eligible for assistance under the programme have been published. The circumstances of other schools who submitted late applications or who submitted additional material are currently being examined by the ERC. On completion of that examination the ERC will forward me a further report. A decision on the publication of the ERC reports <Col N="1012" /> or elements thereof will be taken following receipt of that report.</P>

      <P>Late last year, I announced that I was setting up a special project team to undertake a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students.</P>
      <P>This review, which is at present in progress, is a wide-ranging review covering many topics. These include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation.</P>
      <P>Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. As part of the review, the Economic and Social Research Institute was commissioned to undertake research on the effect of changes in the income thresholds and on related matters. The ESRI submitted its report on the research last month. The report's findings will inform the project team's work on the review, which I expect will be completed in the near future.</P>
