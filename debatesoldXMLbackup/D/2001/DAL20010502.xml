      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 48, Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001 (Judicial Conduct) &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 23, motion re statement for information of voters in relation to the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001 (Judicial Conduct); No. 24, motion re Referendum (Ballot Paper) (No. 2) Order, 2001; No. 49, Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001 (Nice Treaty) &ndash; Second Stage (resumed) and Remaining Stages; and No. 25, motion re statement for information of voters in relation to the Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001 (Nice Treaty). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; (2) the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 49 shall be taken today; and (i) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m.; (ii) the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs; and (3) Nos. 23 and 24 shall be taken immediately upon the conclusion of No. 48, and Nos. 25 and 26 shall be taken immediately upon the conclusion of No. 49 and shall be decided without debate.

      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the proposal for the late sitting and the proposal that No. 48, Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, be the first business today, to conclude at 1.30 p.m., circumstances have changed since the House discussed the matter yesterday. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a botch of the original proposal and introduced amendments that would have made matters worse in that they would have ensured that if there was another Sheedy affair, no procedure of the House would be available to alleviate the situation. He has now circulated 14 amendments in the two recognised constitutional languages. This was done late last night and the Opposition has not had time to consider them. While advance copies were sent to the party spokespersons, most Deputies have only now received the circulated amendments. This is no way to deal with the Constitution. We will not allow this arrogant Minister to drive a coach and four through procedures and insert something into the Constitution without proper scrutiny in this House. I formally advise the Taoiseach that we will not proceed with business this morning unless alternative arrangements are made to debate the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked to consider proposals to change the Constitution, the fundamental law of the country. Many on this side of the House have engaged in the drafting of constitutional amendments and are aware of the scrutiny and length of time required, including the many drafts that pass from the Cabinet to the Office of the Attorney General and back to the relevant Minister sponsoring the amendment. That has not happened in this instance to the point where issues were not resolved prior to introducing legislation to the House. The legislation is premature. It is not standard legislation; it is about a fundamental change, not just to the Constitution, but in the relationship between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. It is at the core of what western democracies are about and cannot be rushed through. The all-party constitutional review committee has recommended that 90 days should elapse between the publication of such a Bill and its consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments proposed by the Minister have not been circulated to Deputies. While they are available in the General Office, they have not been placed in Deputies' post boxes. They are in the two official languages. If there is a dispute over the interpretation of the Irish and English versions, under the law the Irish version prevails. Very few, if any of us, are in a position to arbitrate on such a possible dispute &ndash; I am not &ndash;<Col N="507" /> and we have not had time for our advisers to look at the amendments.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to proceeding with this business today. It is with sadness and reluctance that I inform the Taoiseach that we will not proceed. If he wants to introduce proposals to amend the Constitution in the House today, he will do so alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain what the Deputies are asking for. If they are seeking additional time, as they did yesterday, the Minister has tried to take account of the views and the work of the all-party constitutional review committee. Its work was done on a consensual basis. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution made its report, the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics has made its report, and Ms Justice Susan Denham's committee has made its report. The Minister and the Government have examined and discussed it and we brought forward amendments last night. I accept Deputy Noonan's point that the amendments were only introduced last night. If Deputy Noonan is saying he sees merit in those amendments and if they satisfy the issues raised in the Second Stage debate, that is one thing, but if he is saying his party will not be able to support this constitutional Bill, then the Government will have to reflect on that. I note that Deputy Noonan says that given some extra time he may be able to support the Bill, so I must ask what is his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position is that we were given a raft of amendments last night from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who as late as this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; has again expressed his disdain for the Opposition and its input into this debate. We have not had time to scrutinise the amendments and make up our minds on whether we will support them. We need time to scrutinise the amendments. We are not prepared to proceed with the debate this morning and if the Taoiseach by majority vote forces a debate this morning, we will leave the House and the Minister can continue on his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all want to see the Constitution changed in respect of the relationship between holding judges to account without interfering with the separation of powers. We are not in a position to proceed today. We are not obliged to proceed today. If the Government wishes to make progress on other aspects of business today, I respectfully suggest that the Taoiseach amends the Order of Business and withdraws this item to be taken on another day, and proceeds with the other items.</P>

      <P>We hope to have these amendments for the referenda in a few weeks time. There are time limitations. The amendments as I understand them have been a response to the <Col N="508" /> issues that have been raised here. The amendments are the Government's response to questions put by the Opposition&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying this morning is that we are dealing with a very serious issue. The separation of powers is central to our democracy, it is the foundation stone on which many of our freedoms are built. There are proposals being put forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning which will fundamentally alter that arrangement on the separation of powers. These amendments are not yet available to our Deputies. They were circulated late last night and they are quite detailed. We need time to consider them in advance of any arrangement made for a debate. We are not prepared to take the debate today. It is not a question of more time today, it is a question of having time to consider the position in advance of the debate. That is a reasonable request and if the Taoiseach is prepared to railroad it through the House, we will not participate at all and the Government can take its chances on 7 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the idea of having a referendum without the agreement of the House. That has not been a practice of the House. Deputy Noonan will appreciate that there is a time limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are not. We would like to have the referendum on 7 June. We have been discussing this and if it is a matter of deferring the debate for a number of hours, I have no difficulty with that or even with switching it to tomorrow. However, if the Opposition is just putting it on the long finger, then there is no point in changing. I am trying to find out if the Opposition is serious in facilitating the passage of the Bill or is it looking for a delaying device. It can be taken tomorrow at the latest but if that is not acceptable to the Opposition, then the situation is impossible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to discuss any proposals put to us through the Whips, but the net point is that this is being railroaded through, there are a series of fundamental changes now being made and the Government expects us to simply wave the Minister on. We will not do that. There is nothing sacrosanct about 7 June. It is the Government's self-imposed timetable which was arranged without any discussion with us and we are not bound by any of the decisions made to date. We want time to consider this. The Government has used the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution as an excuse on a number of occasions when replying to us. That committee has recommended that there should be a 90-day consideration period between the publication of amendments to the Constitution and their passage through the House. We are not even being given 90 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that is not a correct interpretation of the report of the all-party committee. There is not a 90-day consideration period. My last word on this is that I am not opposed to changing the times of the debate in order to ensure we hold a referendum in a few weeks time. I do not wish it to drift on into the summer when exams and other difficulties get in the way. We are either serious about this or not. If Deputy Noonan wishes, we can ask for a Whips' meeting to arrange some time to be given today. The amendments are straightforward. Most of them are in response to issues raised during the passage of the legislation in this House. If time is needed today to discuss those issues, I will make that available. The Minister or his officials will deal with those issues. If the Opposition is merely trying to put this on the long finger, then there is no point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for facilitating us but we are discussing fundamental matters. I hope we are doing so in order on the Order of Business. So that there is no misunderstanding on the Taoiseach's part, he is proposing, without consulting with the Opposition, to have four separate items voted upon by the electorate of this Republic some time in June. We were not consulted. We do not like the idea of four items being taken together. Many people would wish the Nice Treaty to be taken separately. There is no necessity to take the four together if the referendum is to be in June. There is every necessity to get this right in light of our experience. We suggest that this matter be decoupled from the timetable that he understandably has which we do not necessarily support although we understand why he wants to proceed with it. The Nice Treaty should be dealt with in the autumn. So that there is no sense of misleading you, Sir, in the event of a Whips' meeting we are opposed to this item being taken. If his timetable is such that it has to be taken tomorrow or the next day, he will take it on his own without the support of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Chair get a word in? I wish to point out there is an Order of the House from yesterday stating the Committee Stage must commence immediately after the Order of Business. That Order will have to be withdrawn by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not in a position to take this debate without considering the amendments that were published late last night. We will need time to scrutinise them. I do not expect we will be in a position to take the debate tomorrow either. I respect the Taoiseach's position as Leader of the House. It is his responsibility to order business in this House. We are prepared to participate in a Whips' meeting to discuss a reordering of business in this House which allows us time to scrutinise these amendments and debate them properly when we have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy enough on that basis and I appreciate what Deputy Noonan has said. I appreciate that Deputy Quinn's position will not change. The Government is anxious to get agreement on this matter. If not, it will have to reflect on this whole issue. We have to do that by tomorrow. The Government will have to decide what referenda it is holding on 7 June, which is the preferred date. We consider that holding a referendum at a later date in the summer would pose many difficulties. It would have to be in the autumn and we are not going into the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Nice Treaty, all the countries seeking enlargement are asking us to ensure there is clarity so that they can get on with their accession discussions. I am not going to hold up half of central and eastern Europe on this issue. We can either do business on this issue or the Govern<Col N="511" /> ment will have to reflect on it. If we cannot have the discussion today we will have to include it tomorrow and then the Government will have to make its decision. We can move on to other items. The Whips will have a short meeting to agree it and try to include it tomorrow. If not, the Government will consider what to do next week and what referenda it should hold. We will make that decision. There is an opportunity to deal with this matter which has been discussed by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and by the Denham committee. We have been offering to deal with this issue and to push it into the autumn or next year does not seem like a good idea.</P>

      <P>Item No. 49 on the Nice Treaty seems to suggest that about an hour is sufficient to deal with the Committee and Remaining Stages. For a treaty that is due a considerable amount of debate and involves not only enlargement, as the Taoiseach is well aware, but the integration of the Western European Union into an economic entity and the militarisation of Europe, it is amazing that neither we nor the people will have the opportunity to partake, through this House, in a discussion&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach needs to clear up the confusion caused by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation about the status of the evaluation of Stadium Ireland. On radio this morning the Minister seemed to suggest that the independent evaluation of the project was, in effect, a public relations arrangement to assuage public concern about the cost of the project and that the outline bidding process would proceed regardless. The Taoiseach is probably aware that yesterday evening the British Government decided not to support Wembley Stadium, which is on the verge of bankruptcy, to the tune of £700 million. Private sector involvement in Wembley is being withdrawn because in a city ten times the size of Dublin a stadium that will attract far more international matches than Stadium Ireland could possibly attract is considered not to be viable on an ongoing basis at a cost of £700 million.</P>
      <P>Taking all that into account, will the Taoiseach confirm that the evaluation of the costs of the project is a real evaluation and not a public relations gesture? Will he give a commitment today that all activity in the Abbotstown process, including the bidding process, will be halted immediately pending the outcome of the evaluation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose a way that would be satisfactory to us and to all Members and that is to take up the observation made by the Comptroller and Auditor General on pages 86 and 87 of his final report on the DIRT inquiry. He would be in a position to conduct a value for money audit on proposals emanating from Government but which <Col N="515" /><Col N="516" /> have not yet been put in place. I propose this because, as the Taoiseach knows, consultants are for hire in this city and the conclusion of their investigation is often agreed in advance with the client. If consultants want to get repeat work they will not aggravate the hand that feeds them so generously. This does not apply to the Comptroller and Auditor General as his integrity is beyond reproach, as would be his report. Taxpayers' money would be saved as the Comptroller and Auditor General is already in the public service and when questioned, he was quite clear about his ability to conduct such a study. His conclusions would presumably have the confidence of the junior Government partners, if they are still there, as well as every other Member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference for the consultants will be for an independent overview. They will have to conduct a wide investigation. The bid phase will conclude on 21 June and figures will then be available, so we will have to wait to see what happens when the process is finished. The only exception to this is the swimming pool, which will I hope go ahead as there does not seem to be any argument about it.</P>
      <P>I am aware of what has happened as regards Wembley, but it is not comparing like with like. Deputy Noonan is as aware as I am that London, with a population of ten million people, has about ten excellent stadia including those at Highbury, White Hart Lane and Upton Park which hold in excess of 50,000 people. I take Deputy Quinn's point that people discussing this issue refer to the money involved rather than the value, which is a pity. If one was to assess the value rather than the money involved, perhaps some people would have a different view of the project.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether the Comptroller and Auditor General conducts the review, the principle behind the report is the same. As I have said in interviews, we should be concerned about value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe that could be looked at in order to prepare the report sooner than in three months time. The work involved should be done in a short space of time. It has been agreed that a steering group made up of officials will look at the terms of reference in an independent way, without input from me or another member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying a contract will not be entered into until the result of the evaluation is available and a binding agreement will not be made with a third party in respect of the stadium in advance of the publication of the evaluation? I put it to the Taoiseach that Wembley is relevant to this debate as no other stadium in London hosts international competition. The Taoiseach's pitch on Stadium Ireland is that it will <Col N="517" /> host international games across the codes. Far more international games are held in London than will ever be in Dublin and the new Wembley Stadium is the proposed location for them.</P>
      <P>Private financiers consider that the cost of £700 million means that Wembley is not a viable project as insufficient games will be played there. How can the Taoiseach maintain that there will be a sufficient flow of international games, along with the odd GAA game, to justify spending £1 billion?</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy Noonan's question, two contracts are moving through the system. The first of these is for the swimming pool, with which I do not think there is any difficulty. It has a tight time scale and it has to be moved on. The other contract is for veterinary laboratories and has already been advertised in a journal of the EU. A tender or a contract for the stadium cannot be given until the review has been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise a separate matter which has been debated considerably in this House and <Col N="518" /> elsewhere and on which the Taoiseach wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> last December. About a year has passed since the House first considered the Labour Party's Bill prohibiting corporate donations to political parties and reforming the method of financing political parties and the conduct of elections. On a number of occasions the Taoiseach has indicated that the Government will make proposals.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was to bring forward amendments following the completion of Second Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which is still parked in the Seanad. We do not yet know what the amendments might be, although a fairly authoritative article in <i>Magill</i> indicated the precise numbers being considered by the Government. The article suggested that the Cabinet has considered and perhaps signed off on these matters. In view of the possibility of an election this year, could the Taoiseach indicate&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>My party, Fine Gael, has also published a Bill which would ban corporate donations and overlaps in part with the proposals in the Labour Party's Bill, which is irretrievably stuck on Committee Stage as a result of a vote by Fianna Fáil members of the committee. We will advance our Bill unless the Taoiseach makes proposals soon and informs the House of the Government's position on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct when he says I outlined certain proposals. Five of the seven Bills I mentioned have been before the House. The sixth Bill will be Deputy Rabbitte's whistle-blowers Bill which the Government will accept with amendments and the seventh will be the lobbyists Bill which is being drafted. By the end of this year all seven Bills will have been to the House as they are needed to correct the aspects of the system which need correcting. I have given priority to the legislation and I hope that all of it will be on the Statute Book by the end of the Christmas session, well in advance of the next general election. The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, is on Committee Stage in the Seanad and amendments to it will be published shortly, I hope next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an extraordinary amount of Government legislation on the Order Paper, resulting in unprecedented delays which reflect <Col N="519" /> the volume of work this House has to deal with, irrespective of who is in Government. One can interpret the Government's reluctance to put its precise thinking in relation to these matters into the public domain as a desire to get to the other side of an election without having changed the rules. That is the Government's real intention, as, if it was to apply to this area of reform, the zeal and dedication it has brought to Campus and Stadium Ireland, this matter would be done and dusted. The Government's reluctance has to be interpreted in a machiavellian way. It does not want to change the rules and prefers to proceed in the manner that has been set out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn knows that he is incorrect. I announced seven Bills in this area. I know he did not think that we would move on with them but we will have all seven of them through this year, in spite of the fact that this House is passing more legislation now than it ever did. I know there is a considerable amount of legislation on Committee Stage but there is still an enormous amount of legislation in the system. However, this Bill will be passed in this session.</P>

        <b>:</b> I have a question on promised legislation, relating particularly to the regulation of the telecommunications market. The unbundling of the local loop, which was to be the last chapter in the liberalisation of the market, has not happened. In the midlands, a company that provides mobile services to 20,000 consumers at competitive rates, is about to go to the wall because the ODTR says her powers are inadequate to enforce compliance. No. 27 on the Taoiseach's list of promised legislation is the Telecommunications Regulation Bill, which is to provide for the extension of certain powers to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and to update the regulatory framework. Will he bring forward this legislation? It is extremely urgent. The publication date of mid-2001 means we will not see it before Christmas at the earliest. Will the Taoiseach make this a priority? The market is not being regulated or liberalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the referendum on the Nice Treaty and strongly urge the Irish people to vote yes. Unlike decisions on previous European referenda, to recommend a yes vote was not necessarily the immediate obvious position to take. The outcome of the negotiations which culminated at Nice was in some ways less than ideal. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a number of serious concessions. They conceded our automatic right to always have a person sitting at the Commission table in Brussels. They conceded a reduction in the number of Irish members of the European Parliament and a reduction in our voting strength in the Council of Ministers. These concessions may not have been inevitable. They were made in part at least because of Fianna Fáil's weakness in any intergovernmental European negotiations.</P>
      <P>The failure of Fianna Fáil to join in or create any serious alliance with other European political parties since we joined the Community nearly 30 years ago is regrettable. This failure is all the more remarkable given the successful terms and conditions of membership negotiated by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Paddy Hillery. We are paying a high price for Fianna Fáil's subsequent failure to embrace fully our European Union membership.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, I repeat what I said at the outset. Fine Gael is in favour of the expansion of European Union membership and we accept the need for the consequential institutional reform contained in the Treaty of Nice. The balance of advantage for Ireland is significantly in favour of continued wholehearted membership of an expanded European Union, which will increase the size of the market from 370 million to 550 million people.</P>
      <P>As an export oriented country, this will be an important boost to our economy. As a prime location for US and other non-EU investment, our attraction for foreign investment is likely to be enhanced when we are part of a Union of 27 countries rather than 15. I am somewhat concerned that the absence of a serious debate and the paucity until recently of publicly available information about the Treaty of Nice may place in jeopardy a successful referendum outcome.</P>
      <P>The content of the Treaty was agreed at Nice last December. The White Paper was launched at the end of March. The debate in this House was initiated earlier this month and the date proposed for the referendum is 7 June, although the Taoiseach has not yet fully confirmed that. I am not clear why the Government has felt it necessary to compress the developments into such a short timeframe. Having committed Fine Gael to support the referendum, I will join wholeheartedly in any public awareness campaign the Government might launch to ensure a successful outcome to the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> In the time remaining between now and the referendum, I hope the Government will be active in seeking public support for the changes required by the Treaty of Nice. To facilitate the achievement of what I believe is an important national objective, Fine Gael is prepared to lend its support to any campaign, whether initiated by the Government or any of the parties opposite. It is in the national interest that the changes contemplated by the Treaty of Nice should be endorsed and on an occasion such as this, a major effort should be mounted to ensure the national interest is best served. My colleagues and I in Fine Gael are available and willing to join in such national campaigns. I hope the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste will find it possible to respond positively to my offer today.</P>
    <P>Ireland has shown in the recent past that we can punch above our weight and more than hold our own in the conduct of our international affairs. Our track record in our membership of international organisations such as the United Nations and the European Union is one of which we can be justly proud. Liam Cosgrave led us into the United Nations in 1955. He and Garret FitzGerald successfully conducted Ireland's first every Presidency of the then European Economic Community. My predecessor as leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Bruton, successfully led the most recent Irish Presidency of the European Union. An enthusiastic commitment to the European Union combined with hard work will hopefully compensate for the formal diminution of our influence to which I referred at the commencement of my speech.</P>
    <P>What I am saying to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste today is that Fine Gael will support all reasonable efforts by the Government to maximise the benefits of EU membership. Through our membership of the EPPED in the European Parliament, Fine Gael has already indicated its support for the Treaty of Nice. We are happy to join with the other supporters of the treaty to bring the benefits to public attention and to ask the Irish people to continue in their support of the development of the institutions of the European Union by voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the June referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Nice Treaty and, in doing so, recognise we have come a long way since 1 January 1972, the day we joined the then European Economic Community, now the European Union. In a relatively short period Europeans have become more united and cohesive. That is recognisable no matter which country one visits in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Europe was at war not too long ago. Unbelievable atrocities were delivered on Europeans by Europeans. That was the culmination of millennia upon millennia of wars in Europe. I do not think we could imagine members states declaring war on each other today. Europe is moving and expanding rapidly, much to the benefit of all those involved in the EU, particularly ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> It is also worth recognising there is a large queue waiting to join and become part of this great and unified Europe. We must ask ourselves why that is the case. Ireland has become the shining star of the European Union. It has benefited most and I dare say has contributed most over the years, even prior to our joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>The cynics might say that other countries wish to join just to get their hands on large amounts of loot from richer member states, among which Ireland is now included. Could we ever have dreamed some years ago that Ireland would have the highest growth rate within the Union, one of the lowest rates of unemployment, net migration to the State and increasing birth rates and all of that while we are well into progressing our £40 billion national development plan, which we are largely financing. That point is worth underlining, although we are doing so on the basis of the support we got since we joined the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is not a cliché to suggest we are now the envy and pride of Europe. We are presented as a shining example of how effective joining and, more importantly, participating fully in the European Union has become.</P>
    <P>As a nation, we have shown that richer states funding poorer states can bring about economic prosperity and those states can, in turn, fund poorer states and provide them with expertise. We have shown by example how they can grow and prosper. That is what the Nice Treaty is about. It is about the wealthier stronger states in the EU helping those less fortunate to become fully fledged and full participants in economic recovery throughout the European structure.</P>
    <P>It is also worth recognising it has not all been plain sailing over those years. Joining the EU has brought undoubted benefits to our country, but it has also brought some difficulties and some of our greatest difficulties have been the introduction of new taxes, such as VAT, and the introduction of unbelievable regulations ranging from the standardisation of excise duties to awarding blue flags for clean beaches. While Europe gave, it also expected much in return. It expects high standards and uniformity. In every area of public endeavour, at Dáil Éireann level, local authority level or parish meetings, the issue of those standards have created some difficulty. Nevertheless, the EU sought to bring about major changes in governance and government.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been a major beneficiary by way of EU subsidies, but farmers have also been losers. Farming, as we all so readily accept, has sadly not been viable for small holders. Thousands of farmers leave the land each year. We have all expressed a fear that the current foot and mouth crisis might give rise to even more farmers leaving the land. While we recognise that the level of investment here over the years has been major and beneficial, there has been a downturn, particularly in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Joining the common market also meant we had to share our vast fishing resources with a host of other states, some of whom would appear to have <Col N="527" /> been intent, at times, on plundering our fish stocks. We have come to recognise the need for strong negotiation in this regard. I am pleased the fishermen now recognise that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, is a negotiator who will ensure the survival and expansion of the fishing industry. I note that some fishermen in County Galway whom he met last week, were pleased that this Minister has a good grasp of the issues. I wish him well in his present brief.</P>
    <P>While there have been many problems along the route to European union, we can confidently say that Ireland has benefited from membership. More importantly, Europe has also benefited from Irish membership and this is an aspect which we should emphasise. The scenario which will continue and improve for many years to come. Poland and other incoming states can also learn from Ireland's experience of using structural and cohesion funds, not as a form of begging or being under a compliment to the giver, although it has sometimes been portrayed as such, but rather as a basis of economic development. The structural and cohesion funds will go towards ensuring that incoming states, many of whom have suffered from a lack of human rights and economic under development under communist rule, can grow, prosper and thereby underpin democratic rule.</P>
    <P>Poland, like Ireland, knows the problem of occupation and the difficulty of gaining and maintaining independence. The rise of Solidarity in the 1980s was the beginning for that country in finding its way forward. Apart from the stifling and oppressive influence of Russian rule, human and cultural rights were suppressed and democracy was denied under communism. Today, Poland is emerging as a potentially major contributor to an enhanced European Union. Just over a decade ago, Poland saw the EU edge closer, when Germany was re-united. Within a few years, Poland will find itself on the frontier of the new European Union. Already, Irish companies are playing a major role in the expansion of the Polish economy. It is now a major profit centre for AIB and I understand it is also an important part of the growth plans of CRH. Many smaller Irish companies are making their way to Poland.</P>
    <P>An acquaintance from Poland who has lived in Ireland for the past 20 years, commented that his country is now ready for the challenge of EU membership and looks to Ireland's experience as an example. Preparation for membership has been good and the Polish people look forward to it as a continuing guarantee of democracy, underpinned by industrial investment and infrastructural support. That is an aspect of the Nice Treaty which should be recognised.</P>
    <P>The root of Ireland's economic success can be attributed, to a large extent, to our education and training systems. Instead of our &ldquo;young Europeans&rdquo; leaving the country, our best and brightest are now returning to invest finance, energy and <Col N="528" /> vitality into our economy and society. A few years ago, FÁS schemes had a high level of participation by graduates who were desperate to find an outlet for their knowledge and skills. Now, FÁS projects are being cut back for a number of reasons. Classroom assistants are now being employed directly by the Department of Education and Science. Local authorities are more involved in village and urban renewal and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands funds the Arts Council to enable regional arts centres to operate.</P>
    <P>European funding made FÁS schemes possible, giving thousands of participants invaluable experience and training, which is now being employed in the mainstream economy. Many fine local and national initiatives received a boost from FÁS European funding and that body is now running recruitment fairs overseas, to meet the varied job demands in Ireland. This provides a model of good practice for countries like Poland and Hungary, who have huge levels of unemployment and social needs, which can help them on the way to becoming good Europeans. Among the thriving and prospering economies, Ireland will be at the forefront in providing the necessary expertise. That, in itself, is a welcome change in our position compared to some years ago.</P>
    <P>We now have a common market and a common currency. As we live in &ldquo;euroland,&rdquo; the very jingle of coins in our pockets will have a similar echo throughout the EU and travel within that area will no longer require a change of currency. Despite its shaky start, the euro will bring stability to the economies of the member states. Its success can be gauged from the fact that, although Britain huffs and puffs about joining, it is clearly a matter of &ldquo;when&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;if&rdquo; it will join.</P>
    <P>Many people ask why we need yet another EU-related referendum. When we voted in favour of the Treaty of Amsterdam, one of its key provisions was the retention of the important safeguard of parliamentary scrutiny. People sought assurances and safeguards and this is precisely what they are now getting, through this debate and the forthcoming referendum, which I hope they will support.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice also addresses issues which were left unresolved by the Amsterdam Treaty, including the size and composition of the Commission, the extension of qualified majority voting and changes in the other EU institutions necessitated by enlargement. It is noteworthy that Denmark, a country not given to acquiescing too readily to the wishes of the wider EU, is not putting the Nice Treaty to a referendum, as it does not involve any transfer of competence from member states to the Union.</P>
    <P>A decision in principle has been made to enlarge the EU. This treaty will ensure that accession will be determined by the ability of the candidate countries to demonstrate that they are in a position to assume the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> Irish business has currently access to a market of 330 million people. Not too long ago, many of these European countries were at war with each other and now they are in a position to mutually support each other's development. The EU has brought peace and stability to Europe. Expansion will further underpin this peace and stability.</P>
    <P>There is a small pocket of opposition to this treaty here. If this referendum is not passed then the real losers will be the countries who wish to join the EU and to follow Ireland's successful membership. Voting for this treaty is voting to make a reality of the hopes and aspirations of the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs among others in the same way that we had aspirations in 1972.</P>
    <P>Our Government has negotiated important safeguards to protect Irish interests. One such issue is taxation. Our favourable tax rates played a major role in transforming our economy into the dynamic force it is today. Some people are concerned about supporting the Nice Treaty because of the issue of retaining an Irish member of the EU Commission. Large member states will have a 50% reduction in the number of commissioners. We will continue to maintain our Commissioner until membership of the EU reaches 27, the point at which Commissioners will rotate. Membership will rotate regardless of the size of the country and that should be noted. We must have confidence as a nation that we can protect our interests even if we do not have a Commissioner at the table.</P>
    <P>Peace and security is something we must value. We must recognise the importance of stability and peace by supporting each other as nations. The EU will continue to play a major role in this area in Europe. Ireland has, for many years, played a major role in UN peacekeeping and now with a seat on the Security Council we will play our part in contributing towards world peace rather than just European peace. We will be asked to contribute to EU peace missions but we will only participate if these operations are authorised by the United Nations and approved by the Dáil. Let us hope that our position on the Security Council will ensure that rapid and effective responses are made to situations such as those in Rwanda and Bosnia and that EU peace missions do not involve European troops watching as those they are supposed to protect are slaughtered. Ireland's role in peacekeeping is a noble and vital one and cannot be overstated. In an enlarged EU we will maintain and expand our role while new and existing members will learn from our vast experience.</P>
    <P>Our infrastructure and prosperity has benefited enormously from EU membership. Individual citizens have access to our own and European courts. Human rights have been upheld and legislated for as a result of European court decisions. Consumers have had their rights upheld across the EU. Our education and training programmes have been enhanced by European learning and funding and this is a tremendous benefit. The fact <Col N="530" /> that education and training programmes have been brought to every town and village has benefited our people.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice, some might say, is about payback time. As a nation we can go forward into a bigger union where we can ensure other nations prosper as we have. The EU is about rising tides lifting all boats. Never has a phrase been put to better use in this regard. I commend this Bill and hope people will vote for progress and prosperity throughout Europe. On 7 June we should recognise the huge changes that have occurred across Europe. The diversity of the people of the EU, the huge changes in living standards and the aspirations of democratic processes throughout the EU becoming a reality should urge us to support the treaty. The diversity of Europe is its strength and the enlargement to the east will increase that diversity.</P>

      <P>Behind the question which will appear on the ballot paper in the Nice referendum is another question which the electorate of this State has never been asked explicitly by any Government and which is not asked in this Bill, but it is the real question. The Taoiseach did not address it when I put it to him here on 7 March. The question is the one put by the president of the EU Commission, Romano Prodi, to the EU parliament on 13 February. Mr. Prodi asked &ldquo;Are we all clear that we want to build something that can aspire to be a world power, in other words, not just a trading block but a political entity&rdquo;? My answer and that of Sinn Féin is no and that is why we are calling on people to vote no in the referendum.</P>
      <P>We favour and actively promote fraternity and co-operation between nations across Europe. We oppose the creation of a new super power, an EU super state with its own army dominated by the largest countries. Rival regimes aspiring to be world powers have caused untold misery, including two world wars, countless smaller wars and the ongoing economic exploitation of the poorer nations of the world and the majority of the human race. Has the lesson not been learned or do we wish to repeat the exercise on an even larger scale in this century?</P>
      <P>Since the Single European Act in 1987 the clear direction of EU development has been towards the creation of a giant state. The development has been too slow for some of the more gung-ho Euro-federalists but it has been inexorable. More and more democratic control has been taken away from us in relation to both domestic and international affairs. The EU Commission and the EU Council of Ministers have become more powerful. The Nice Treaty increases that power and removes yet more democratic control from the hands of elected representatives in this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chancellor Schröder of Germany has let another cat out of the bag with his proposal revealed this week to turn the EU Commission into a fully fledged central EU government with the Parliament and the Council of Ministers <Col N="531" /> becoming a bi-cameral legislature having full budgetary and legislative powers. The Chancellor clearly believes that Nice is in the bag and already he and his colleagues are preparing for the next step. I hope the electorate, on whatever date the referendum is set, will give him second thoughts.</P>
    <P>The end of 2002 has been set as the target date for the ratification of the Nice Treaty by member states, yet the Government is rushing headlong into a referendum on 7 June. There is no necessity to hold this referendum before the autumn of this year at the earliest. It is disgraceful that the referendum is being railroaded in this way including the guillotining of the debate here today. Why is this being done? This is the only EU Government so far which has had to put the Treaty of Nice to its electorate. This Government wants to deliver for its partner Governments as quickly and decisively as possible. It holds itself up as the model Government in the model economy to which all candidates for EU membership aspire. Our Government hopes that getting this treaty passed quickly will show the others what good boys and girls we are. What the aspiring members do not see is the dark side of our economy and our two tier greed driven society.</P>
    <P>This Government's approach to the referendum shows contempt for the electorate, the same contempt shown when Fianna Fáil's pre-election promise of a referendum on joining NATO's so-called partnership was binned by An Taoiseach. With Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats they trooped through the lobbies to join the NATO club. People were outraged at that U-turn and the Government was damaged far more than it cares to admit. It may well have taken the people for granted once too often.</P>
    <P>The Nice Treaty is being presented by its supporters as the treaty of enlargement. It is no such thing. In reality, this treaty is about changing very significantly the structure of the existing 15 member European Union. By introducing qualified majority voting in a whole range of new areas, 30 in all, it moves away from the right of veto of individual states and away from the requirement for unanimity based on consensus. The automatic right of each state to nominate a commissioner is also going. Voting weight on the Council of Ministers will favour the larger states and our strength will be decreased. These changes will come into effect from 1 January 2005 regardless of whether there are any new EU members then.</P>
    <P>In the treaty, enhanced co-operation is the euphemism for the development of first and second class membership. A core group of states can advance ahead of the rest, using the EU institutions to further their perceived common interests, including a common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental shift from the idea of the EU as a partnership of equals with no state having less power or influence because of its size, and all proceeding together on the basis of agreement. This fundamental shift prompted Deputy Quinn <Col N="532" /> in the Dáil, on 13 September 2000, to describe Nice as &ldquo;a disaster&rdquo; and &ldquo;an appalling set back.&rdquo;  He said that &ldquo;not only will Ireland's interests be damaged but those of every small state because the concession made by the Taoiseach and others, which he could have blocked, means that he has irreparably damaged the role and function of the Commission. Therefore, he has damaged the interest of every other country in the European Union, big and small.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet in his speech here, on 3 April, Deputy Quinn supported the treaty and castigated those, including Anthony Coughlan, who properly highlighted the Labour Party leader's previous remarks. He accused Anthony Coughlan of trying to portray him as anti-European. What embarrasses Deputy Quinn is that his own remarks show that he is not anti-European but was anti-Nice, at least until the 13 September. He has now changed position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn's colleague, Deputy De Rossa signed up with 51 of his fellow Social Democrats in the European Parliament to a statement which says that the Nice Treaty did not go far enough and calls for the EU to take up &ldquo;an aggressive global stance with economic and monetary power being buttressed by equally powerful diplomacy and a world-wide position supported by a military capacity.&rdquo; Is that compatible with Labour Party policy?</P>
    <P>Almost 39% of the electorate voted against the Amsterdam Treaty. Such a large percentage was drawn from the support bases of all parties. What representation are those people being given here today? Limited as it is, I am proud to give it nonetheless, along with a few colleagues in this House. The front benches of Government, Labour and Fine Gael together show a united front supporting the Nice Treaty and the back benches, as usual, echo with bleating assent, or the sound of silence. On a lighter note, I advise the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the Fine Gael and Labour agriculture spokespersons, to ensure that their colleagues, particularly those from rural constituencies, remain in Dublin for the next month as the movement of so many sheep around the country poses a real danger.</P>

      <P>As I said, on a lighter note. The Government's U-turn on NATO's Partnership for Peace was followed by its commitment of troops to the rapid reaction force, the core of an EU army. We have to thank President Prodi for his candour in saying that if we do not want to call it a European army, we do not have to. We can call it Margaret or Mary Ann, but it is the first such joint European effort, as distinct from bi-lateral effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nice Treaty further develops the common foreign, security and defence policies of the EU. It erodes Irish neutrality and independent foreign <Col N="533" /> policy. Support for the EU armaments industry is explicitly written into it. Already, as a result of involvement in the rapid reaction force and the PfP, the State's defence spending has increased significantly. The parties of the so-called Opposition think they smell blood in pursuit of the Government on the proposed national sports stadium, an issue currently before the House, but there is not a murmur from them about increased State spending on weapons to keep up with the boys in NATO. Whatever one thinks about the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl,&rdquo; at least it is reasonable to acknowledge that it is a venue for healthy pursuits.</P>
    <P>There was very little reference to the effects of EU development on partition. In the 1960s, Seán Lemass promised that EU membership would make it irrelevant. His successors turned their backs on the Six Counties, and EU membership under their stewardship in the 1970s and 1980s, was manipulated to benefit the better off, particularly the rancher-farmer class. The creation of a single currency led to the ludicrous situation where we have increasing all Ireland co-operation on many levels, under the Good Friday Agreement, but a fiscally more divided island. The Nice Treaty provisions for a two class EU create the potential for a further division between the two sides of the Border. Will we find one side in the first rank of states and the other in the second? Guess where we will be? The Treaty of Nice creates that very prospect. What say do people in the Six Counties have in this process? They are under the jurisdiction of a state which does not have a constitution and where the people were not consulted on any of the major developments of the EU, which people in the Twenty-six Counties voted on often over the past 14 years.</P>
    <P>The German Foreign Minister, Joshka Fischer, in Dublin on Monday, used a scare tactic to influence the outcome of our referendum. He stated that a &ldquo;no&rdquo;  to Nice would mean &ldquo;no&rdquo; to enlargement. This is patently false as the proposed changes will happen regardless of whether any new state joins. The Treaty of Nice is not about enlargement but about further centralising the EU, placing more power in the hands of the larger states to allow them to create a two tier EU. A rejection of it by the electorate here would be welcomed by people throughout the EU and, despite contrary claims, by peoples in applicant states. By rejecting the Nice Treaty, we can help secure a better deal for applicant countries. I emphasise again that this is not about EU enlargement. We who oppose the treaty are not opposed to new states joining the EU. That is a decision for the people of those states and the 15 member states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice should not be incorporated in the Constitution and I urge its outright rejection by the electorate, a position I am happy to adopt with my colleagues from the Green Party, the Socialist Party and the independents, Deputies Gregory and Healy. There are many campaigning groups and concerned citizens of all <Col N="534" /> opinion who join in that call and urge the electorate to reject the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Wade. Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to the farming community. If we had a plebiscite among the different sectors of society, the farming community would be overwhelmingly in favour of the EU and the benefits it has brought the country. I do not represent too many rancher-farmers, but the small sized farmers. They always supported the EU and our participation in it. One of my predecessors, the late Paddy Smith, a contemporary of the Ceann Comhairle's, recalled the difficulties he had, as Minister for Agriculture, in getting a market for Irish products. The only market available to us at that time was the British market, and the British decided the prices. We had very little leverage because we had no other markets. That has changed since we joined the European Community, now the European Union, in 1973. Agriculture has seen huge changes and great improvement in incomes for the vast majority of farmers.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to seek the agreement of the people to the constitutional changes necessary to allow the State to ratify the Treaty of Nice which was signed by the Foreign Ministers at the end of February last. A number of Ministers have outlined clearly that the decision to have a referendum is based on the clear legal advice that ratification of the treaty by the State requires constitutional change. What is involved is the updating and consolidation of the rules governing enhanced co-operation, and the introduction, on a limited basis, of enhanced co-operation in the area of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the treaty includes some limited and necessary updating of provisions for putting into effect the decisions on humanitarian and crisis management tasks agreed in Amsterdam. There is no departure from the firm commitment which is in line with this Government's policy of neutrality that Ireland would participate only in operations authorised by the United Nations in accordance with the appropriate legislation and subject to Dáil approval. Efforts to suggest otherwise are completely misleading. I would not support any Bill or legislation that would affect our neutrality.</P>
      <P>The development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy under the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty has led to an enhancement of the capacity of the EU to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks, known as the Petersberg Tasks. Existing security arrangements and procedures have been adapted to carry out these tasks, and Ireland is actively and constructively participating in improving European responses to challenges which may arise. Important steps have been taken in developing European Union capacity to undertake crisis management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers on both sides of the House have stated clearly that the issues at stake are of historic importance. The divisions on the Continent <Col N="535" /> of Europe over the past century led, on two occasions in particular, to global conflict which brought widespread slaughter and mass suffering of unimaginable proportions. Subsequently there was ideological confrontation and a mass denial of human rights and fundamental freedoms for close to half of the people of Europe. Against this background we must view the success of the European Union in reconciling former enemies and, over the past four decades in particular, in presiding over a basis for co-operation among a growing number of western European countries. That has been a phenomenal achievement. The enlargement of the Union will contribute substantially to that task.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the difficulties we have had on this island, in particular political problems in the province of Ulster. In this context I pay tribute to the European Union which has been very supportive of the peace process and has given support to different Governments here, particularly since the early 1990s. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1996, the European Union contributed in financial terms to the International Fund for Ireland. Following the cease-fires at the end of August 1994, the European Union, at the request of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and the British Prime Minister, established the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. That programme has been very worthwhile, and a new programme, Peace II, is to follow. It put £106 million into the economy of the six southern Border counties since the end of 1994. The economy of the six northern counties received support worth over £450 million from the same programme. A further £80 million will have been spent in the six years ending at the end of this year on supported cross-Border co-operative initiatives. As a Deputy representing two Border counties, I record my appreciation of the work of different Commissioners in the European Union and their senior officials in identifying the need to support projects which would help to consolidate the peace dividend.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the advantages that have accrued to this country and, in particular, to the farming community arising from the decision to join the European Economic Community, which then had six members. Now we have a Union of 15 member states. There was overwhelming support for each of the referenda put to the people in this State, and for our further participation in the European Union. The Oireachtas and people voted strongly for the necessary legislative and constitutional changes to bring into effect different treaties since 1972. The people, through their support for those referenda, indicated clearly their satisfaction with the workings of the Community and, particularly, the economic progress that has been achieved as a result of our participation in the Community. We now belong to a powerful trading bloc, a single market of 375 million people and also a single currency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> This is a very important treaty. It is another stage in the development process of the European Union. It prepares the Union for further enlargement and the inclusion of ten applicant countries. The accession of the 12 central, east European and Mediterranean countries will add over 100 million people to the European Union's population and increase its land area by one-third. Obviously, there are major challenges and opportunities. The enlarged Union will continue to work in the interests of all its citizens. One only has to travel in rural Ireland to see the large-scale improvements that have occurred since our membership of the Union in the early 1970s. There have been economic, social and cultural benefits. Ireland has received very large-scale transfers of funds, particularly to the agricultural community and also, through Structural Funds, towards building up the necessary infrastructure &ndash; roads, water, sewerage &ndash; to create job opportunities throughout the country. We see today, through the implementation of very positive economic policies by this Government, a shift in economic development away from the east coast so that a balanced regional development can occur. Were it not for the investment in infrastructure over the past number of years in less developed areas, they would not now be attracting job opportunities for their people. Providing jobs for people in their own areas helps to keep people in rural communities.</P>

      <P>The Treaty of Nice is about reforming the European Union, having a bigger European Union benefiting more Europeans. It is about a more prosperous European Union which will underpin democracy in the applicant states of eastern Europe. This treaty is about reform, prosperity and progress.</P>
      <P>It sets about making the institutions of the EU work for the 27 member states of the EU of tomorrow at least as well as they do for the 15 member states of today. These institutions were designed in the 1950s for the six members of the EC. Plainly they need to be reformed. These reforms must provide safeguards for smaller countries like Ireland. The Treaty of Nice does this. In the European Commission, these reforms mean that Ireland will have one Commissioner like all other members after 2005 at which time the five large states will give up their right to a second Commissioner. Later when there are 27 states in the EU, there will be a rotation system where Ireland will be represented no differently from the larger states. In the European Parliament, it will be necessary to agree a reallocation of seats to accommodate the new member states without creating a chamber which is too large to operate effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the reforms agreed at Nice, Ireland has been allocated 12 seats. This allocation ensures that the number of MEPs representing Ireland will be twice our entitlement on a population basis. In the Council of Ministers, these reforms ensure that Ireland continues to have ministerial <Col N="537" /> representation at every meeting of the Council. We will continue to have a voting weight of more than twice our entitlement on a purely per population basis. In the Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers, the Treaty of Nice ensures that Ireland retains a strong voice in a reformed European Union.</P>
    <P>Back in the 1970s, Europe did not turn its back on us. When we first joined the EEC we were the poorest country in the Community. Today that is different. Our growth rate last year was more than three times the average of other EU member states. Not only have we managed to balance the books but we have a £4.6 billion surplus, the largest of any EU member state. Our unemployment rate is half the EU average. We enjoy the lowest degree of taxation in the euro zone. Our national debt is tiny by comparison with the EU average. This record proves it. For 30 years, Europe has worked for Ireland. Today the EU candidate states are looking to Ireland as a model for their own development in Europe. We should be proud of that. Just as Europe did not turn its back on us 30 years ago, we will not turn our backs on the applicant states today.</P>
    <P>In voting yes for the Treaty of Nice, we are offering the same helping hand that was offered to us. There are some, however, who would spurn these applicant countries. There are anti-European parochial forces who would like to see us turn in on ourselves economically, socially and culturally. They will wheel out the same tired arguments against the Nice Treaty that they wheeled out many times before. In 1973, we voted to join the EEC. In 1986, we voted on the Single European Act. In 1992, we voted on the Treaty of Maastricht and in 1998 we voted on the Treaty of Amsterdam. The very same arguments are used time and time again. They painted a picture of Ireland forced into NATO, poverty and a loss of self-determination, but they were wrong.</P>
    <P>In 1998, Patricia McKenna threatened that if the Amsterdam treaty were ratified, we might well be saying a last goodbye to neutrality. The national platform threatened then that a yes vote for the Maastricht Treaty would lead to the conscription of young Irishmen into a European army. Roger Garland went so far as to claim that the Treaty of Maastricht, if ratified, would lead to increased unemployment, poverty and immigration. On all counts, they have been proved wrong. They were wrong in 1973 and at every other referenda and they are wrong today.</P>
    <P>In bringing the benefits of EU membership to 12 new states we will also benefit Irish business. We are in a superb position to take advantage of the business opportunities which enlargement will provide. At present, Irish business has access to a market of 370 million. When enlargement is completed, this will expand to about 550 million. Already our companies are exporting and investing heavily in these applicant countries. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently mentioned, our exports to the applicant states in central and eastern Europe rose by 3.3% to 7% in <Col N="538" /> the five years to 1999. These states also provide Irish business with excellent investment opportunities, with our companies already investing over £1 billion. We have nothing to fear economically from the Treaty of Nice nor have we anything to fear in regard to our neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice includes some limited and necessary updating of provisions for putting into effect the decision on humanitarian and crisis management tasks agreed at Amsterdam and accepted by the people in 1998. There is no departure from that firm commitment and it is in line with this Government's policy on military neutrality that Ireland would participate only in operations authorised by the United Nations and subject to Dáil approval. The Treaty of Nice will not alter our military neutrality.</P>
    <P>In addition, it does not take away our right to set our own taxes. Fianna Fáil in Government has championed the lowering of taxes for Irish workers and business.</P>

Seán Lemass made our first application for membership in the 1960s and Jack Lynch presided over our entry into the EEC in 1973. We continue this long and proud tradition in calling for a referendum on the Treaty of Nice and for a clear yes vote in the referendum. Nice will not affect our military neutrality. It will not affect our ability to set our own taxes. It will reform the European Union and will bring the benefits of the European Union to millions more Europeans. It will aid prosperity in Ireland and throughout Europe. A vote for Nice will be a vote for reform, prosperity and progress.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this unexpected opportunity to speak on the Nice Treaty. I expected to be here but dealing with other business. This is an extremely important issue and like so many other important issues that we are putting to the people, I hope we can have a structured debate across the country.</P>
      <P>One of the things that frustrates people is their so-called betters either in Brussels or in Dublin making decisions and expecting them to rubber-stamp them. We have a growing sophisticated population which will not tolerate that approach. It is extremely important for us to radically refine the process by which we prepare positions for the people and the mechanisms we use to engage with people in explaining the important journey this country is making with its brother and sister countries that make up the continent of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nice Treaty, the next step in the incremental development of the European Union, presents particular challenges to us as a people and as a <Col N="539" /> nation. As the certainty of economic benefits, the clear cash transfers, diminish we are required as a people to reflect and to vote not merely on the basis of what is in it for us in direct money terms, but rather to begin in a much more generous way to look at the shape and governance of the European continent into the 21st century. Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, this country has changed beyond all recognition not just in terms of prosperity, but in every discernible way and not least in terms of our sense of confidence in ourselves. It is true, if at first sight an apparent contradiction, to say that as our sovereignty was pooled in the growing institutions of the European Union so too the greater our sense of Ireland and Irishness has become. That apparent paradox is important for us because the notion that we have somehow diminished our sense of Irishness or controls over our governance through participation in the great European project is argued constantly in these debates. We can play a significant role and have an impact on the European stage with confidence. In sporting parlance we can box above our weight.</P>
    <P>The question now is what Ireland's view is of the future. How will we progress the European ideal? What kind of Europe do we want over the next 20 years? What role are we content to play in its development? The debate on previous treaties has largely focused on market and economic matters. This treaty gives us an opportunity to begin the debate on the type of institutional reforms within the Union which will enable it accept 34 or 35 new nations as members. Not all the necessary changes have been agreed. It is fair for people to attack the Treaty of Nice as in many ways it is an imperfect document. If we were to put our hands on our hearts none of us would be particularly delighted with the outcome of the Nice Council, but what is being offered are the reforms which can be achieved and it would be sterile to reject what is there and hold out for something better when there is nothing better on offer.</P>
    <P>The simple principle before us is that of enlargement, and it is on this that we are required to make a central decision. For me and my party the approach to this issue is clear and direct. We should not, nor will we, deny the benefits of membership of the EU to the former communist states of central and eastern Europe. The Continent was artificially and structurally divided on the conclusion of the Second World War. While the political leadership of western Europe, shaped by the horrors of that war, set about the task of making conflict in Europe institutionally impossible, countries which came under Soviet influence were effectively separated from that great enterprise. The threat of war between the two power blocs after the conclusion of the Second World War created a fault line for 50 years through the middle of the continent. We all celebrated the end of that awful threat with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the subsequent liberation of <Col N="540" /> countries and the democratisation process which spread rapidly though the countries of central and eastern Europe, constituting the rolling collapse of totalitarianism.</P>
    <P>Our celebration of that collapse and our applause of the people who initiated it would be hollow indeed if we denied to those brave citizens the right of full and equal participation in the EU. However, enlargement is not put forward merely for altruistic reasons. The new EU will consist of enormous numbers of new citizens, new consumers for Irish products and will present new markets and new opportunities for Irish entrepreneurs. Much more importantly, the future security of Europe and our own security will be immeasurably strengthened by the process of enlargement. There is always a view that somehow because we are an island on the periphery we would not be affected in any great way by a new maelstrom of war which might ignite on the continent. In a modern world with modern weaponry that is a ridiculously naive hope.</P>
    <P>The defeat of the treaty would be grist to the mill of those forces of reaction currently building nationalist movements throughout the Continent. It would give to those forces an argument that the applicant countries are to be permanently excluded from status equal to that enjoyed by current members, and that the burdens of institutional reforms which we as a Union have demanded of them are for no real purpose. We cannot allow that happen. The threat of new nationalistic forces stirring up domestic xenophobia are real and manifest themselves in growing right-wing parties, fascism and a growing incidence of racism.</P>
    <P>I listened with wry amusement to a representative of a so-called Nationalist party speaking from the backbenches talking about our duties. It is very clear that Ireland has had the benefits of EU membership for a very long time, economically and culturally. In every discernible way we have improved ourselves as a result of membership, and we must now play a part, not on the periphery looking to see what is in it for us but contributing to the heart and shape of the evolution of an idea whose journey's end is not yet clear or absolutely defined. We have achieved much in Europe in the past half century, not least relative peace. We have seen remarkable economic regeneration and social expansion. Through a series of citizens' rights we have enjoyed freedoms throughout Europe as a result of charters of non-discrimination. We changed Europe so much that most young Irish, French or German people would rightly regard the prospect of war between France and Germany, or Britain and Germany, as utterly unthinkable. However, we have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>How do we set about building the next phase of this project? How do we ensure it is people driven and people led? The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, proposed one idea at the beginning of this debate which I hope will be engaged with by the Government. He pro<Col N="541" /> posed an Irish forum on the future of Europe modelled on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. This goes to the heart of what we are about. We have been reactive in the past, humble in our own involvement, believing that the momentous decisions were for others &ndash; Germany, France or Britain &ndash; to make, that it was for them to drive ideas and that we were there to see how we could fit in at the end with some negotiated benefit by way of almost benevolence from the larger countries. We are now in a uniquely different position. We have respect and ideas and can drive, model, build and develop the concepts for the governance of a developing Europe. I would like acceptance of the proposal put forward by the leader of the Labour Party for a forum which would be inclusive of all strata in Irish society, a people's forum and not a political forum, which would engage in the type of debate and argument now required if we are to bring people with us on the important journey we are undertaking.</P>
    <P>Irish people support Europe but are always suspicious of any authority they feel is attempting to keep information from them, to limit debate or full participation. That is a very healthy scepticism. We should not be seen to rush any of these proposals. We should allow for the fullest debate in the House and I regret the Government is insisting on a vote this morning. If an open ended debate were allowed it would not take up much more time than the guillotine imposed by the Government. Such a measure also gives an argument to those who allege that something secretive, underhanded and excluding is happening. That is a pity.</P>
    <P>I will support and canvass for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Nice Treaty referendum campaign. It is only a small and in many ways flawed step to achieve the structures required for the massive expansion of the EU envisaged over the coming years. We should not give spurious arguments to those who oppose the treaty. There is a predictability about their arguments on every EU referendum. It is almost as if they will be right some day if they repeat the same thing for 20 or 30 years. Yet a modicum of humility should attach to them to the effect that if they are proven fundamentally wrong they might have the good sense not to warn that the same things might befall the nation if people vote against the treaty.</P>
    <P>The debate on every other EU treaty has centred on the maintenance of national sovereignty <i>versus</i> the pooling of sovereignty in a unique way through what is a unique project. There are no direct equivalents of the EU. It is not and will not be a united states or a federal or confederate state. It is unique. We must shape it in a way that suits the independent interests of a culturally rich continent that needs to have its diversity of language, culture, skills and tradition understood and enhanced, not pooled in an American version of a <i>plurabis unum.</i> We are not striving for a <i>plurabis unum</i> but are concerned with a vibrant continent of diversity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> The institutions of the EU are imperfect and often weak as those who have dealt with them will testify, be it at Commission or Council of Ministers level. I had the honour to deal with both and was President of the Environment Council of Ministers during the last Irish Presidency. I could outline at length the weaknesses but we must address the solutions to them. Not all 15 member states agree with those that may be suggested by me or by Ireland.</P>
    <P>One inescapable truth, however, is that the institutions of Europe have been a guarantor of rights, pushing progressive legislation through often reluctant Governments. It has made us reform. In the area of labour law a raft of amendments from our earliest days of participation were forced through by Europe giving rights that we now take for granted. Personal rights and freedoms have been underscored by Europe and have often been used by Governments as a defence for doing things that might offend elements of conservative society. Those winds of progressive change have come from Europe. I welcome them and wish they would blow stronger.</P>
    <P>Europe pushed us into monitoring and protecting the environment. The Government faces a number of legal actions because it has not been adventurous enough in bringing to completion agreements it freely entered into at European level. There is a big stick forcing us to act correctly. All this has been good for us.</P>
    <P>The debate now and for the future is how we will next develop and who will travel with us. Fundamental fault lines are emerging. The debate in the past year from Ministers, including the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Finance and the Minster for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, on the dichotomy of whether we as a nation should look to Boston or Berlin is a frightening development. It is almost as if conservative forces take the view that while we got the economic good from the Union we do not share the vision. They propose a different model of less engagement with the principles of social and Christian democracy which have characterised Europe. I look forward to that debate because I am clear about a social democratic view of the future. I hope a forum will be created to allow it to happen.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to address the issues of membership of the European Parliament, the Commission and qualified majority voting. On numerous occasions I have pointed out to the committees of the House of which I am a member the huge deficiency in this Parliament's scrutiny of the Council of Ministers. We allow Ministers to make decisions in our name with little control over them. We need to reform our institutions to ensure the democracy we demand at the heart of Europe applies for a start in this Parliament.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the Nice Treaty I would have liked to be different and many of the proposals should have been more developed. However, in this debate, which is concerned with <Col N="543" /> whether we take a small step to embrace future developments, especially with regard to the emerging nations who wish to participate in this great project, the House and the nation should give a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in answer to the proposals in the Nice Treaty.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Foley.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way since 1 January 1973, the day we joined the then European Economic Community, now called the European Union. In a few short years Europe has become more united and cohesive. Not too long ago Europe was at war. Unbelievable atrocities were inflicted on Europeans by Europeans.</P>
      <P>Europe is moving and expanding rapidly. A large queue of applicant countries is waiting to join the Union and become part of a great and united Europe. Cynics may say these countries wish to join to get their hands on large amounts of money from the richer member states, including Ireland. Did those who negotiated Ireland's membership of the EU ever dream that Ireland would have the highest economic growth rate, one of the lowest unemployment rates, net immigration and increasing birth rates? At the same time the country is spending £40 billion on the national development plan which it is largely financing from its own resources. We are the envy and the pride of Europe and are presented as a shining example as to how effective full participation in the Union can be. As a nation we have shown that the model where richer states fund poorer ones can bring about economic prosperity and that these newly wealthy states can in turn fund poorer states, provide them with expertise and show them by example how they can grow and prosper.</P>
      <P>Joining the EU has brought undoubted benefits to the country but it has also brought us some of our greatest difficulties, for example, new taxes and unbelievable regulations. While Europe gives it also expects much. It expects higher standards and uniformity and it has sought to bring about major changes in Governments and governance.</P>
      <P>Agriculture was a major beneficiary from EU subsidies but farmers were also losers. Sadly, farming has become unviable for small holders. We see thousands of farmers leave the land each year. I fear that the current foot and mouth disease and BSE crises will give rise to even more farmers leaving the land.</P>
      <P>While there have been problems along the route of European expansion, we can say with confidence that Ireland has benefited from membership of the EU and what is more, Europe has benefited from Irish membership. We all hope that will continue for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incoming members such as Poland can learn that receiving Structural and Cohesion Funds is not a form of begging and of being under a compliment to the donor. Far from it, Structural and <Col N="544" /> Cohesion Funds will go towards ensuring that incoming states, many of whom suffered from a lack of human rights and economic under development under Communist rule, grow, prosper and underpin democratic rule.</P>
    <P>Poland is a country like ours which has experienced occupation and which knows how difficult it is to gain and maintain independence. The rise of Solidarity in the 1980s was the beginning of that country finding its way, far from the stifling and oppressive influence of Russian rule. Under Communism, human and cultural rights were suppressed and democracy was denied. Poland is now emerging as a country that will make a major contribution to the enhanced European Union. Just over a decade ago, Poland saw the EU edge closer when Germany was reunited. Poland will in a few years, find itself at the frontier of the new European Union.</P>
    <P>Irish companies are playing a major role in the expansion of the Polish economy. Poland is now a major profit centre for AIB, and is an important part of CRH's growth plans. Many other smaller Irish companies are making their way in this noble country. The Polish people are ready to accept the challenge of membership of the EU. It will be the first time in that country's history that it can look forward to continuing and guaranteed democracy.</P>
    <P>The roots of our current economic success are found in our education and training systems. We are still the country of the young Europeans but instead of leaving the country, our best and brightest are returning to invest finance, energy and vitality into our economy and society.</P>
    <P>Not many years ago, FÁS schemes would have had a high number of college graduates participants. They were desperate to find an outlet for their knowledge and skills. FÁS projects are now being cut back. Classroom assistants are now being employed directly by the Department of Education and Science, local authorities are now more involved in village and urban renewal, and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands funds the Arts Council in such a way that regional arts centres can now operate. European funding made FÁS schemes possible &ndash; they gave thousands of participants invaluable experience and training which is now being applied in the mainstream economy. Many fine local and national initiatives and enterprises received much needed funding from FÁS and European funding. FÁS is now running recruitment fairs overseas to meet Irish market demands.</P>
    <P>Countries such as Poland and Hungary who have high levels of unemployment and social need, will have a model of good practice which will help them on their way to becoming good Europeans as thriving and prospering economies. Ireland will be their model.</P>
    <P>We now live in euro land. Very soon, the jingle of coins in our pockets will have a similar echo throughout the EU.</P>

      <P>The success of the euro can be gauged by the fact that although Britain has not yet joined, it will not be too long before it joins the euro zone. We voted in favour of the Treaty of Amsterdam and one of its key provisions is that parliamentary security remains an important safeguard. This is why we are debating this Bill. The people have sought assurances and safeguards and this is precisely what they are getting. The people will have the final say in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Nice seeks to address issues that were not resolved by the Amsterdam Treaty &ndash; the size and composition of the Commission, the extension of the qualified majority voting, and changes in other EU institutions necessitated by enlargement.</P>
      <P>There is a small pocket of opposition to this treaty. If this referendum is not passed then the real losers will be the countries who wish to join the EU and who wish to emulate Ireland's successful membership. Voting for this treaty is voting to make a reality of the hopes and aspirations of the applicant countries just as we voted to obtain our aspirations in 1972.</P>
      <P>Our Government has negotiated important safeguards to protect Irish interests. One such issue relates to taxation. Our favourable taxation rates played a major role in transforming our economy into the dynamic force it is today.</P>
      <P>Large member states will have a 50% reduction in the number of Commissioners. We will continue to retain a Commissioner until the membership of the EU reaches 27 and Commissioners will then be retained on a rotational basis. Membership will rotate on a strict basis regardless of the size of the country. We must have confidence as a nation in this regard.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill and I appeal to the people to support the referendum.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Second Stage of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001. The purpose of the Bill is to seek the agreement of the people to the constitutional changes essential to allow the State to ratify the Treaty of Nice which was signed by 15 Ministers of the European Union on 26 February 2001.</P>
      <P>I understand the decision to have a referendum is based on the clear legal advice that ratification of the treaty by the State requires a change to the Constitution. In the absence of an amendment, having carefully identified those options and the discretion which may be exercised by the State, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, it is now necessary to make specific provisions to permit the exercise of the options or discussions included in the Treaty of Nice. What is involved is the updating and consolidation of the rules governing enhanced co-operation, the introduction on a limited basis of enhanced co-operation in the area of the common, foreign and security policy, and the extension of the scope of qualified majority voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> It is clearly desired that any risk of legal uncertainty on matters of such importance to the State as the treaty in establishing the community and the Union, should be avoided.</P>
    <P>The treaty will only come into effect if ratified by all 15 member states. When ratified, the measures adopted will equip the Union to function effectively with a significant increase in membership and at the same time provide the required protection for the country's essential interest. It is intended to prepare the way for a significant enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Treaty of Nice was to bring to a conclusion the process of institutional reform which began with the Treaty of Amsterdam, and which was intended to prepare the Union for the admission of a significant number of new member states. In June 1999, the European Council decided to convene an inter governmental conference to settle the issue left unresolved at Amsterdam. These included the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, the extension of qualified majority voting, and changes in other EU institutions necessitated by enlargement. In June 2000, the European Council subsequently added enhanced co-operation to the agenda.</P>
    <P>The European Union is continuing to seek ways of playing a greater role for peace, stability and security in Europe, and Ireland has a strong interest in maintaining a stable, inclusive security environment. It is essential for Ireland to be centrally involved in shaping future changes in the direction that it would wish to see them go. Ireland pursues this objective not only through the common foreign policy of the EU but also through the primary role of the United Nations and other international organisations.</P>
    <P>The development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, under the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, has lead to an enhancement of the capacity of the EU to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks. Existing security arrangements and procedures have been adapted to carry out these tasks and Ireland is actively participating in improving European responses to challenges which can arise.</P>
    <P>Important steps are being taken in developing an EU capability to undertake crisis management. Therefore, one can say that the issues at stake are of historic importance. The divisions on the constitution of Europe in the past century have lead, on two occasions, to global conflict bringing in its wake slaughter and massacre of massive proportions. That was followed by confrontation and massive denial of human rights and fundamental freedom for close to half of our fellow Europeans. Against this background, the success of the European Union in reconciling former enemies, and in providing over the last four decades a basis for co-operation among a growing number of western European countries has been a tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>In 28 years, from 1973 to 2000, Ireland has received almost £22 billion in price supports, <Col N="547" /> including direct payments from the guarantee section of the European agriculture fund. In addition, our farmers have benefited from receiving higher prices for their exports through the highly supported Union market. All of these benefits have enhanced farmers' incomes and transformed their living standards in line with the rest of society. The consequences are obvious throughout rural Ireland. They take various forms such as new and refurbished houses, increased car ownership, general purchasing power and full participation by farmers in the life of local communities.</P>
    <P>In addition to these benefits in the form of price supports, agriculture, the food industry and rural areas have benefited from the European agriculture fund. These benefits have been enormous over the 28 years since our accession. Structural funding was the leverage for matching funds from the Exchequer and, together with the contribution of the beneficiaries, amounted to a massive investment in the agricultural food industry and rural structures. Farms have been modernised and made more productive. There has been major investment in anti-pollution and hygiene measures. There have been benefits not only to farmers in the form of higher productivity but to the public in the form of a better environment and higher levels of food safety.</P>
    <P>Rural areas have benefited directly from structural funds. Hundreds of small development projects started with the assistance of structural funding. Perhaps more important than the benefits which flow from the projects is the confidence that initiatives like Leader have given to rural Ireland. There are many rural areas which were depressed for generations, where the people had become despondent, even hopeless, about the future. Leader gave these people not just funding but some measure of control over their own futures. The change of attitude, from near despair to confidence, has been one of the hallmarks of a rapidly developing rural Ireland in recent years.</P>
    <P>What is certain is that the benefits of EU membership for the Irish agriculture and food industries and for rural development have been tremendous. These benefits have occurred because the EU institutions function well. They allow the voice of a small country to be heard and its interests taken into account. They also allow for decisions on the running of the Union and on the formulation of Union policies to be taken at reasonable speed. It is in Ireland's interest that this process continues in an enlarged Union. The institution changes and changes in decision making procedures in the Treaty of Nice are designed to protect this process. That is why I believe the people should strongly endorse the changes in this referendum.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is concerned with preparing for enlargement but it is also about the continuing development of the Union, of which we have been a full and committed member. During the period of our membership, the people enjoyed <Col N="548" /> substantial and economic benefits, reflected in our unprecedented levels of employment, growth and prosperity. Our network of roads and services have benefited substantially from structural funds, averaging more than 2% of GNP during the 1990s. Our education and training programmes have greatly benefited under the European social fund down through the years. We have gained from and contributed to important advances in areas such as the environment, social programmes, equal rights for men and women and consumer protection, all of which are matters of direct concern to every citizen. Nobody seems to believe that these advances would have been achieved to anything like the same extent if we were outside the Union.</P>
    <P>Support for our full participation in the Union is not based on economic calculation alone. Being at the heart of Europe has given Ireland the opportunity to bring its distinctive voice to a wider audience. In return, we have opened ourselves to new influences which have broadened our experience and enriched our national life. Nobody realises this more than this generation of young people. Many of them know through experience that whether in Paris, Dublin or Warsaw we are part of a common enterprise, facing the same issues of worthwhile jobs, strengthening our communities, and building a decent society in which all can participate. These are the real challenges facing the Union in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As a country which has benefited and which continues to benefit greatly from Community membership, it is in our interest that the Union can operate and take decisions even with a larger membership. Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the benefits offered by an enlarged Union. A single market would expand to over 500 million people. We are in an excellent position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by enlargement.</P>
    <P>Our record as a nation is one of generosity. Long may that continue. I am confident that the people will say yes to enlargement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate. During my contribution I want to concentrate on the security aspects of Nice and of the treaties which preceded it. Ireland's neutrality should not continue to be eroded by stealth. I agree with that. However, it is time for Ireland to go beyond neutrality and to do so on terms most favourable to ourselves. There is an opportunity to do so and we should avail of it. If not, it is possible, even likely, that traditional neutrality as we know it will disappear on terms which are not so favourable. The reason we are not taking the opportunity is the fear which has been created by reckless politicians who trade on fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as difficult now in the Republic to get a sane, rational and reasoned debate on Ireland's neutrality as it is for a delegate at a DUP conference to try to bring about a sane, rational and reasoned debate on the Good Friday debate. <Col N="549" /> Why? Because of reckless politicians, elected and unelected, trading on fear, building up falsehood and filling people with irrational doubts. By holding these fear-based doubts, sane people are missing the opportunity to secure accommodation for their views so that we could decide on a case by case basis when we will remain outside conflict and when we will become involved, as a support for the common good.</P>
    <P>I hear people in this House extolling the virtues of the European Union in the area of economic benefits and human rights. The greatest virtue of the European Union and what went before it is the peace and stability it has brought to Europe. Some 60 million Europeans, most of them in their prime, lost their lives in the first half of the last century because we did not have a structure like the European Union, an integrated democratic body. That Union is worth defending. It is worth our while participating in that Union when it defends the rights of others. When we talk about virtues, that should be at the top of the list &ndash; the peace and stability which forbids German, French, British and other peoples from going to war to kill each other in large numbers when they are little more than children. Is that not the prerequisite for prosperity? How else can we have the other great virtues which have been extolled? What has happened to this House that all its Members must be politically correct and extol the same sentiments and virtues while omitting to talk about the greatest virtue of the European Union, the security it has provided for this and future generations? It is time we played our part in providing that security, without apology to anybody.</P>
    <P>We live in a changed Europe, one that is no longer bitterly divided between two blocs but which is increasingly coming together in an enlarged European Union. Unlike any previous union, this Union is not the result of military conquest but of the freely given consent of the people of Europe. It is a union based on democracy, respect for human rights and solidarity between peoples, regions and generations. The Nice Treaty marks the next crucial stage in that process of development. It adapts the institutions of the Union so it can welcome our fellow Europeans in the applicant states. For this reason and despite certain misgivings about aspects of the treaty, to which I will return later, I welcome the treaty and look forward to its ratification by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that ratification has been put in doubt by the manner in which the Government is handling the treaty referendum and by the manner in which it has handled European affairs from the day it took office. It does not give me any pleasure to recite the litany of confusion and subterfuge which has been the European record of this Government. On the day the Government took office there was the botched effort to install the new Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, as a Minister for European Affairs at Cabinet. Following this fiasco, there was a failure to desig<Col N="550" /> nate a Minister of State to take responsibility for European affairs. Ireland is one of the few, if not the only European state, which does not have a Minister with responsibility for European affairs. Having failed to appoint a Cabinet Minister with this portfolio, we do not even have a Minister of State with that remit. As a result the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Minister of State were understandably, and correctly in many cases, preoccupied with Anglo-Irish matters and there was often no Irish political presence at Council of Ministers meetings.</P>
    <P>Then there was the appalling cynicism with which the Government approached Irish entry into the Partnership for Peace. Fianna Fáil railed against PfP both in Opposition and in Government. The current Taoiseach told the House that PfP membership would bring the Germans back to Bantry, the British back to the Curragh and made other similar comparisons. Under Fine Gael pressure, however, Fianna Fáil in Government executed a U turn and, without the promised referendum, took Ireland into the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>There was also the spectacle of the Taoiseach denying that the European Union was developing its security and defence capabilities when every other government in the EU was not just admitting it but was advocating and explaining its importance to their electorate. A significant element of the Nice Treaty is that there has been a reversal of what happened in the Amsterdam Treaty. The Western European Union is to be taken out of the treaty with the exception of a single mention. Why? It is because the European Union intends to do the business itself. However, Members of this House are told it is not happening.</P>
    <P>Then there was the spectacle of various Government Ministers embarking on anti-European tirades. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, complained about Europe imposing decisions on Ireland. The decisions were, no doubt, previously agreed by her or her officials in the Council of Ministers. She was simply following in the tradition of her leader who, as Minister for Finance, voted to abolish duty free sales and seven years later tried to blame Europe for a decision which he could have prevented. Meanwhile, the Tánaiste was chasing some form of Boston paradise rather than the European Union, through whose disciplines and assistance we created the Celtic tiger. There was also the Minister for Finance ranting and raving about the EU because it dared to question his budgetary strategy.</P>
    <P>Then we saw the mishandling of the Nice Treaty negotiations, with the Taoiseach opting to have a sham fight about national control over taxation. That veto was never at risk given the publicly stated positions of the British, Luxembourg and Swedish Governments, to name but three. As a result, the Government took its eye off the ball and conceded that Ireland would not always have <Col N="551" /> a seat in the Commission. The European Commission is the key instrument of the Union and is the only body that can initiate change. Large states, due to their size, can perhaps live without a Commission seat, although I remain sceptical as to whether that will ever happen given that there will be at least two further Intergovernmental Conferences before the Union reaches the critical figure of 27 member states. For small member states such as Ireland, however, a permanent presence in the Commission is vital and the Government should not have agreed to give it away.</P>
    <P>I am sure pressure about the size of the Commission was exerted by large states. It should have been resisted. Such pressure was applied during the Amsterdam Treaty negotiations but was strongly and successfully resisted by the rainbow coalition and the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, the then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and myself as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs at both Departments.</P>
    <P>Given the record of cynicism, incompetence and in-built euro-scepticism on the part of some members of the Government, it is no surprise that the forces opposed to European integration believe they can win this referendum. I anticipate there will be the usual lethargy on the part of the Fianna Fáil organisation and Deputies during the campaign. If that is the case, there is every possibility that this referendum could be lost. Traditionally, Fianna Fáil has relied on Fine Gael organisations in the constituencies to motivate the electorate. It is time the Fianna Fáil Deputies spent more of their time on serious issues.</P>

All this is for a treaty which does not need to be ratified for a further 18 months. Again, Government incompetence hands anti-Europeans a stick with which to beat it.</P>
      <P>European Union supporters have nothing to fear from a lengthy, considered debate and the Government should think again about the timing of the referendum and postpone it until the autumn. More time would also allow for a broader debate about the type of European Union we wish to develop and what role we believe Ireland should take in that Union. A key part of that debate must be about Europe's developing security architecture and how we see Ireland's role in it. I wish to make the case for a departure from traditional Irish neutrality in a pro-active way and in circumstances and on terms best suited to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I believe our neutrality has been compromised and that it is intended to abandon our traditional view of neutrality. The Government, having made that decision, as it did on Partnership for Peace, refuses to tell the people. I will be happy to return to the question of Irish neutrality when the debate resumes.</P>

      <P>Following an advertisement and assessment process, I announced on 22 May 1999 the allocation of funds totalling £1.2 million to 59 successful projects, in accordance with the terms of the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988. The process of disbursing these funds to the projects concerned has been ongoing since 1999. The figure of £280,000 included in my Department's estimates for 2001 is the total funding expected to be disbursed this year to the <Col N="553" /> remaining projects that have not been allocated funds. There follows a list of those projects which have drawn down or are due to draw down funding this year.</P>

      <P>The outstanding sum of £280,000 is relatively small but it is significant for many groups who applied for money. Will this sum go to new applicants? Is the list for applications closed? Is this simply a matter of ensuring that those who were allocated money are facilitated in drawing it down in respect of conditionalities that cannot be met? Are other factors preventing them from utilising the money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had a useful meeting with Sinn Féin representatives, including the party president, Gerry Adams, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Health and Social Services, Bairbre de Brún, on Thursday, 12 April. Our discussions included the ongoing exclusion of Sinn Féin Ministers from attending meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, decommissioning, policing and the exclusion of people from Nationalist areas of Northern Ireland. It is wrong and unsustainable that certain Northern Ireland Ministers are excluded from attendance at North-South Ministerial meetings. As the two Governments stated at Hillsborough on 8 March, it is essential that the full operations of the North-South Ministerial Council and British-Irish Council resume, and that the institutions continue their important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards putting arms beyond use, I very much welcome the engagement between General de Chastelain and an IRA representative. It is <Col N="555" /> now essential that further and early progress be made on this critical issue. While good progress has been made on policing, it is imperative that new policing arrangements are such that they, to quote the Patten Commission report, &ldquo;are capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity at the meeting to raise at some length the issue of the expulsion of persons from Nationalist areas, and to stress the unacceptability of this. In response, Sinn Féin representatives said their party would continue to use its influence to bring this to an end. I will continue to press the issue on every appropriate occasion. The reality is that acceptable new policing arrangements would help greatly to resolve the problem, a point that was made by Sinn Féin at the meeting. I am in no way lessening the responsibility on everyone with influence to do everything possible to bring this heinous practice to an end.</P>
    <P>Work is ongoing at official level between the two Governments to try to make progress on the outstanding issues before the British general election. I will continue to keep in contact with the British Prime Minister and the pro-Agreement party leaders in Northern Ireland as and when necessary over the coming period although their focus inevitably will be on their campaigns once the election is called. However, once the election is over, we need to make very early progress in order to resolve all outstanding issues as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>At the invitation of the Secretary of State for Scotland, Helen Liddell, and the First Minister, Henry McLeish, I will undertake an official visit to Scotland in June. Although the programme is not yet finalised, my visit will include an address to the Scottish Parliament as well as the unveiling of the famine memorial in Carfin, which is to be followed by a civic reception hosted by North Lanarkshire Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of Martin McGuinness's statement to the Saville inquiry, saying he was second in command of the IRA in Derry on Bloody Sunday? Does the Taoiseach believe the statement marks a departure from the practice adopted by the republican movement of insisting that Sinn Féin and the IRA are two separate entities? The belief of successive Administrations in this jurisdiction was that while there was single membership of either organisation, dual membership was the norm rather than the exception, particularly at the highest level. Does the Taoiseach now envisage that negotiations will take place with Sinn Féin at senior level in the foreseeable future without the fiction of referring the matters agreed to the army council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no insight other than press reports into the factual basis of Mr. McGuinness's statement. I welcome the development, however, as it has been signalled for some <Col N="556" /> time that he would make a comprehensive statement. The whole purpose of the Saville inquiry, apart from all the presentations to it, is to get to the truth. Anyone who can add to what is known about Bloody Sunday should do so as it is not a trial or an adversarial criminal investigation. Having worked hard to build on the Irish Government's document and to convince the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to have a tribunal some years ago, I know that it is important that Martin McGuinness makes a contribution. We have to wait to see what happens, but it is vital that those who have relevant information come forward so the truth can be established.</P>
      <P>On the relationship here, while some people down the years have continually said &ldquo;Sinn Féin/IRA&rdquo;, it has been the practice of the Irish Government to treat them as separate organisations. However, as I said in 1995 while in opposition, I view Sinn Féin and the IRA as opposite sides of the one coin. I have not changed that view. It is a view I held long before I was in a position of authority. I said that in one of my earliest statements about Northern Ireland. I also held that view while dealing with Sinn Féin, although the reality is, when we deal with Sinn Féin as a political party, it will not ever communicate other than to say it will consult and use its best efforts and endeavours with the IRA. That has been the position down the years with successive Irish Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with anything the Taoiseach has said and I welcome Mr. Martin McGuinness's statement to the Saville inquiry. It is helpful. However, what I want to explore with the Taoiseach is the nature of the advice he is receiving now and whether this is a once-off position taken by a leading member of Sinn Féin in respect of the Saville inquiry only. Does it indicate a movement towards the position in which both he and I and all parties in this House have believed for some time, that Sinn Féin and the IRA are not two parallel organisations but the same Republican movement and at the highest level Sinn Féin and the IRA go hand in hand? Does he see a situation emerging or has he been advised on the possibility of a situation emerging where in future in negotiations with Sinn Féin he will be able to conclude matters across the table without the fiction of reference to an army council, which in many respects does not differ in personality to a great degree from the negotiators? Could he reflect on this. If this is the movement forward, it seems to me this is of benefit to the peace process. It is something which should be encouraged. In the very involved manner in which the Republican movement moves forward, it may be a significant move forward. I would ask the Taoiseach if he has any reflections on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="557" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information. There has not been any indication at official level or security level on this issue. It is very much seen as in the spirit of the Saville inquiry that Mr. Martin McGuinness is putting his position to help in the process of finding the truth.</P>
      <P>On the other issue, I do not see a change in the relationship. I do not see a situation emerging where the Irish Government, in trying to find the thinking behind the Republican movement, will get it in a way other than the way it is getting it at present. However, I work towards a time when Sinn Féin will move on to the next step and, in using its best efforts and actions, will ultimately, sooner rather than later &ndash; at times I think it may not happen as late as many people would think &ndash; get to a situation where the IRA with which it has an association will not exist. That is the path we are on. I do not think that will happen overnight or in a year, but it is a realistic assessment for all of us, who, as political parties, work closely with Sinn Féin to give it that space and freedom of movement. That is a realistic process so that as we work through this situation we will get to the stage over the next few years where the IRA will cease to exist in the form in which Sinn Féin has had a close association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>To move on to another issue dealt with in the Taoiseach's reply, he expressed concern that the North-South Ministerial Bodies are not meeting and I share his concern about that. He said he had a meeting with Sinn Féin in early April and that this matter was discussed together with some other matters. Has he had a meeting with Mr. Trimble or with the British Government or with the leader of the SDLP where the fact that the North-South Ministerial Bodies are not meeting as intended was discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had contact with them all. Tomorrow the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will meet the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, in London. My Secretary General will meet the <i>Chef de Cabinet</i> to Mr. Trimble tomorrow. I have also had contact with Mr. Trimble and I have talked to Mr. Séamus Mallon and Mr. John Hume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue is that while the North-South bodies are working well, the very real difficulty is that both Mr. Martin McGuinness and Ms Bairbre de Brún, two members of the Executive, are not allowed to perform their role in the North-South bodies. This is because of a suspension, which has been struck down in the courts and is on appeal, and which does not seem either fair or reasonable. That continues to create a difficulty. Without trying to increase tension on this matter, we have been trying to find ways to keep things moving. It is still a real difficulty. I have discussed the issues and will discuss them again this weekend with the parties concerned in a fairly informal fashion because as we get to the election period, we do not want to put them under too much <Col N="558" /> pressure. While I will have meetings, they will be low-key and will not be public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the very serious concern in Northern Ireland among both traditions at recent revelations regarding the Arms Trial? Will he do everything in his power to ensure the truth in relation to events at that time is found out because it is a matter of serious concern to both traditions in Northern Ireland?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach given any thought to the recent comments by Mr. Mitchell McLoughlin to the effect that the census in Northern Ireland last Sunday will hasten the day of Irish unity in so far as it will indicate a substantial increase in the number of Catholics in Northern Ireland, and that this, to quote one of his colleagues, will ensure a united Ireland within 15 years? Would the Taoiseach agree that this sectarian rhetoric is extremely dangerous and that what we ought to concentrate on in Northern Ireland is not some &ldquo;rabbit theory&rdquo; of out-breeding the other side but rather the solid work of being involved together in governing Northern Ireland in bringing about reconciliation by combating the serious social, economic and political problems of Northern Ireland and by partnership between North and South through the cross-Border institutions? Would he agree that this is the way forward and that Mr. McLoughlin's comments are very dangerous, apart from being sectarian?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first issue, I said on the Order of Business yesterday that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General would prepare a report on this. The whole effort will be to make sure that whatever should be in the public domain, will be in the public domain and therefore the answer to that question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the second issue, it is not helpful to try to predict what might happen in the longer term. People may have their views on it but the important thing, on which I would agree with Deputy Currie, is to try and bed down the institutions and make them work across the sectarian divide, make them lessen the sectarian tension and make the mechanisms work. That is working well but anything which heightens the tension is not helpful. Whatever comes out in the census will come out in the census anyway and I do not think we should mix that with the political agenda.</P>
      <P>The spirit of the Good Friday Agreement is to work for peace and reconciliation in every way we can. There is provision within it for these matters to be reviewed at another time and in other circumstances, but that is not now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that any statements of this nature are negative and increase tension and that we should concentrate on the positive rather than these sectarian comments? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House knows, in my dealings with all the parties I try to keep them on the political agenda and away from the sectarian one which never proves productive. We know how unproductive it is every summer. Any statements not based on the principles of peace and reconciliation always prove to be counterproductive. Irrespective of who makes them, they are picked up by the other side and reverberate back. Any statements used in that way are not helpful.</P>

The Taoiseach made an explicit appeal on Sky News on Easter Sunday to the IRA to engage in the decommissioning process. Has there been a response of any kind to that explicit appeal he made on behalf of all of us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions between General de Chastelain and the IRA are representative, useful and helpful. I am not privy to all of the details. I know those contacts are helpful, but I will leave it at that until we hear more from General de Chastelain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Decommissioning Act, 1997, provides for regulations on certain immunities, which will expire on 22 May. What plans, if any, has the Taoiseach to extend the life, in legislative terms, of these immunities? When will we see the necessary resolution or motion to that effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government recently extended the remit of the decommissioning body, which was to effectively cease this summer. I cannot recall the date to which its remit has been extended. I believe it is until next spring; I do not think it is for a year. It has not done that by order yet, but as soon as we have that, we will make the necessary moves.</P>
      <P>As I said before, if there were agreement between General John de Chastelain, the decommissioning body and the IRA representatives or any of the other paramilitary organisations, it might mean an extension or some changes. That issue will also have to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the forthcoming discussions the Taoiseach will have with the various political parties, will he bring to their attention that, between 1995 and 2000, 1,600 people in Northern Ireland were forced into involuntary exile without any recourse to a court or democratic or judicial process? They have remained, for the most part, in exile for fear of their lives or that of their families. All of that happened at a time when the paramilitiaries on both sides were on a form of ceasefire. As a confidence building measure, can the Taoiseach impress upon the political parties associated with paramilitaries on both sides to indicate that the enforced exile of those 1,600 Irish people, men and women, has <Col N="560" /> been lifted and that there will be no retaliation against them or their families should they choose to come back to Northern Ireland? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that. I would like to expand on what I said in my reply. We went into some detail on the issues raised by Deputies Currie and Quinn during Question Time on a number of occasions during a substantive part of the meeting I attended with Sinn Féin. Examples were given of some of the groups of relatives who have been writing submissions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself and, I am sure, to many members of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Three points arise out of that. First, Sinn Féin gave a commitment it would do all it could on the ground to make it possible to resolve this position. Second, it gave many instances in reply to circumstances I outlined and said all the blame tended to be put on their membership or people associated with them, but that was not always the case. It said there were also community activists on the ground and that it was not behind every one of those groups or bodies. Third, we explored what I said in my reply about policing. In many cases the reason people are being excluded from these areas, apart from paramilitary involvement, is that residents' concerned groups turn on those people because of their anti-social behaviour and as there is no adequate policing the situation gets out of control. I use that argument all the time as a reason we should try to find a compromise on policing. If we did that, we would not have that difficulty.</P>
      <P>Some areas are close to being no go areas and the police cannot deal with these issues. There is always a certain risk in saying this, but it is becoming clear to the representatives concerned that this is a very good reason we should try to have a more balanced police service in Northern Ireland whose members can police these areas and, apart from the violent issues of the past, the sectarian issues, can deal with what are community and anti-social issues, which are no different from any of those that have to be dealt with in our constitutencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming there is no change of Government in Britain, which seems unlikely given the anticipated general election on 7 June, there is a short window of opportunity between 8 June and the marching season within which the issue of policing could be resolved. That window extends to the Assembly elections and subsequent local elections in Northern Ireland of approximately two or three years. There is an absolute imperative on all sides to compromise and arrive at a resolution of the impasse over policing before the commencement of the July marching season in order to put in place a mechanism, to use the Taoiseach's phrase from an earlier reply, to bed down the institutions in a secure manner and remove the difficulties associated with the non-participation or the ban on the participation by the First Minister, David Trimble of <Col N="561" /> the two Sinn Féin members of the Executive. The key to this is moving quickly after 7 June on the basis of compromise on all sides to bed down institutions by bringing forward a satisfactory compromise proposal and a solution to the policing issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair analysis. The aftermath of the election will leave three weeks or less, as 1 July is a Sunday. As I said before during questions on Northern Ireland, this is not the way we would have hoped it would have worked out. For a long period it seemed we would have an adequate period, but that is not to be. If, as expected, the election is on 7 June, we will have a very short period of intensive work. Since Easter we have done what I said we would do during Holy Week. We have had active engagement. My officials met Prime Minister Blair's officials last week. They were also in Northern Ireland last week and they are there again today. There will be a meeting between the SDLP and Sinn Féin tomorrow and matters will be reviewed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will meet the Secretary of State Reid over the weekend. I hope to have a further round of talks with a number of the parties. It is clear that by this time next week the game will have moved on. Our work will stop about this day next week. We will have to wait until after the election, but we will try to get as much done and as much compromise as we possibly can between now and next Tuesday or Wednesday and then we will have to wait. It is correct to say there will be an intensive period from 10 or 11 June and there will be only two working weeks after that. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Taoiseach's discussions with Sinn Féin, did the issue of conditions for Sinn Féin supporting the new policing arrangements arise? Did it outline these conditions to him? To what extent is it prepared to support the new arrangements? As the Taoiseach is aware, there was a major recruitment for the new police force in the North and some 10,000 people applied. Will those people now be shortlisted and interviewed, or will the whole process be put on hold until the SDLP and Sinn Féin are ready to support the new policing arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed all of those elements, particularly with a view to getting an understanding with both Sinn Féin and the SDLP. The particular difficulty of the SDLP is in relation to the judicial tribunals which it is seeking on the Nelson, Finucane and Hamilton cases. Subject to that, they are prepared to move to a substantial degree on a number of issues. Seamus Mallon has repeatedly made it clear to all of us that it is not enough to say there will be legislation and he has not agreed to sign up unless he is firmly convinced that such legislation will be in line with the Patten report. Having spent so much parliamentary time leading this debate through the House <Col N="562" /> of Commons and the committees last year, Seamus Mallon was very clear on what he wants to achieve. His position is well documented and he is unlikely to move from it.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin has a longer list. In addition to some of the issues already mentioned, it has particular concerns with structures and management systems and the operation and accountability of the new policing system at district and local level. In my view, all the issues can be dealt with and agreed on, but only if people compromise on various aspects of the situation. All the issues are important but if we are to progress towards inclusive governance of the entire system, we just have to get some compromise. I have gone through the issues in great detail with all the parties and we gave an assessment to the British Government last week of our understanding of the position on each outstanding aspect. The Irish Government officials, from my own Department, Foreign Affairs and Justice, have put an enormous amount of work into giving a very fair assessment of what we believe will achieve a conclusion fairly well in line with Patten. It may not be exactly the same as Patten and it is not easy to get it perfectly in line but it has to be an approach which provides a fair and meaningful basis to move forward on the policing service. We will be trying to progress that over the next week.</P>
      <P>On the recruitment question, there was an enormous response to the recruitment invitation. However, I do not really see matters progressing successfully until we reach a sign-off position. Realistically, it would be very difficult for young Nationalists to be put in the dilemma of joining up and commencing their training, without a clear message from the parties to whom they would have at least a broad political allegiance. I have got this view from young people in the Nationalist community who have never been involved in any kind of violence and whose families have no involvement in political parties, other than supporting them on election day. I certainly could not tell those young people to ignore what their political parties are saying.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is the Taoiseach concerned at the conclusions of a recent United States Government report which refers to a huge increase in membership of the Real IRA and mentions a very worrying aspect that this consists of new recruitment into the system, rather than simply members transferring from the Provisional IRA? Does the Taoiseach agree this poses possibly the biggest single threat to the existing peace process? Is he concerned that the US Government has not proscribed those organisations and outlawed them with regard to fundraising? Bearing in mind that many people in the Irish-American community still see the situation through green-tinted glasses, far removed from reality, does the Taoiseach agree there is an urgent need for an approach to the US Government by both the Irish and British Governments, to have those organisations proscribed in the United States? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="563" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last question first, the British and Irish Governments have already taken all appropriate steps and provided all relevant information with regard to the proscribing of the Real IRA. I understand a decision is likely to be made shortly.</P>
      <P>On the question of the reported increase in membership of that organisation, I am always concerned that such reports can glamourise an organisation and provide it with favourable propaganda. The reality, as I understand from my information, is that after the Omagh atrocity which caused such carnage among the civilian population, most people who had any connection with that organisation moved well away from it for obvious reasons. I believe it is a correct inference that it did not succeed in recruiting people from other paramilitary organisations but has targeted its efforts towards misguided young people whom it has sought to brainwash into its evil deeds and lifestyle. I have no information to suggest there is any more than a limited group involved and it is unclear how the US report arrived at the assessment which has been referred to.</P>
      <P>The Government will, of course, give all possible co-operation to the US authorities in dealing with the fundraising issue.</P>

What are the proposed dates for the visit, how long will he stay, what engagements will he undertake and will he have any other engagements anywhere else in Great Britain in the course of the same visit? Would it be a fair interpretation now of Government policy that it is seeking as a Government to develop a separate and distinct set of relationships with the devolved administration in Scotland and Wales distinct from the foreign policy pursued with the London Government? How does the Taoiseach see that developing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be on or around 20 June. I will address the Scottish Parliament, visit the Carfin memorial which I was to visit some months ago and I will meet the political representatives of the parties. I will attend receptions held by the Ministers and the Scottish Secretary of State, Helen Liddell, and meet Henry McLeish. I will also meet some other groups I should have met on the last occasion but that has not been finalised.</P>
      <P>On the second issue, it is not a secret that devolution opened up two things. For the British-Irish parliamentary group it opened the opportunity to change our structure. We debated many times that we should have a new and inclusive arrangement for involving the devolved administrations and parliaments in our affairs. That includes the devolved administration in Wales and Northern Ireland, the Parliament in Scotland and the other assemblies. It has equally given us the opportunity at foreign policy level to recognise and deal constructively with the new administrations. They are now elected parliamentary representatives. They have their own parliamentary and assembly structures and are anxious to develop their own identity. It gives us the opportunity to make up lost time with these institutions. We were more involved in the past and we now have the opportunity to be involved again. We moved quickly to develop those relationships by putting consuls in both Edinburgh in Scotland and Cardiff in Wales. We will continue to develop them while ever-mindful of criteria laid down by the foreign office and by the directions of No. 10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Taoiseach has said but he is as aware, as I am, that there is still such a thing as the United Kingdom although it may not be part of the political landscape. Taking that into account, to what degree does the Taoiseach feel he can develop an independent foreign policy with Scotland and Wales without <Col N="565" /> coming into conflict with Mr. Blair's Government, with which he has a very good relationship? What are the demarcation lines that have been agreed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Office in respect of our relationships with Wales and Scotland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the Foreign Office, Ministers at junior level are involved in overall foreign policy issues. Diplomatically the Foreign Office would be made aware of any of the arrangements we make. Some of the meetings I had in Wales, outside of the assembly meetings, were attended by the representative with responsibility for devolution and foreign policy issues. This is an evolving position for them and us and it is important to ensure that we work with them and do not go off without keeping close contact with the Minister responsible. That is the line but it is not being pressed. The procedure is that all our relationships, contacts and developments and how our consuls general work operate in a free and open way. There is a proposal, whether it happens after the British election, that there would be one Secretary of State and one administrative function that would deal with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That is the way United Kingdom foreign policy proposes to work <i>vis-à-vis</i> the three bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Taoiseach's position is that he will continue to develop separate relationships with the Scottish and Welsh administrations but that he does not see an actual potential for conflict between the development of those relationships and the relationships which he has with the London Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In these early years it would be wrong of us to get into conflict. Rules are laid down, although not strictly enforced, and we should be conscious of them, but there is no reason they should affect any of our growing relationships. This will develop further after the election when we will see the Scottish and the Welsh attend European meetings at different levels. That will allow us to have close relationships with individual Ministries. Many issues we have talked about in the British-Irish context show we can work closely with them. Our experiences are more relevant to sharing with Wales and Scotland than perhaps with London. There is enormous potential for us to share and we will be careful not to create any difficulty.</P>

      <P>In his answer the Taoiseach included Northern Ireland in the group. Does he suggest that our relationships with Northern Ireland in the future will be through the Department of Foreign Affairs, similar to those with Wales and Scotland, or was that an inadvertency in his answer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment where we deal with Helen Liddell or Dr. John Reid, it is likely <Col N="566" /> that there will be one Secretary of State responsible for all three areas.

We will continue as we have but they are unlikely to allow three Secretaries of State.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether it is fair and reasonable, in the context of the leaving certificate examination, that a pupil's future academic progress or employment prospects are assessed solely on the basis of a single written examination, with oral, aural and practical examination in certain subjects; if he has proposals to broaden the scope of individual student assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim and purpose of the established leaving certificate is to prepare pupils for proceeding to further education or for immediate entry into open society. The examination is mainly a test of achievement. Employers and others wishing to use it for selection purposes are advised to institute their own supplementary tests, which should assess aptitude rather than achievement.</P>
      <P>I am committed to widen, where possible, the variety of assessment procedures used in the leaving certificate. At present, engineering, construction studies, agricultural science, agricultural economics and music use either a practical, project or course work assessment component and written papers. Irish and modern European languages are examined by means of aural and oral components and written papers. Four subjects have more than one written examination paper &ndash; English, Irish. mathematics and technical drawing. While all leaving certificate subjects are examined at ordinary and higher levels, Irish and mathematics are examined at foundation level also. The choice of questions used to test the stated assessment objectives is wide.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) advises me on matters relating to assessment procedures for the subjects which are part of the leaving certificate curriculum. The council reviews the content and assessment of the various subjects on a rolling basis. My Department is prepared to consider revised assessment proposals which are well developed and critically do not impact unduly on class contact time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further significant assessment reform at senior cycle was brought about with the introduction of the leaving certificate applied programme. Innovative approaches to assessment have been intro<Col N="567" /> duced and the system of accumulating credits leading to an overall award is particularly appropriate given the objectives of the programme and the needs of the students targeted by it. In other countries, assessment procedures are broadened by having the class teacher engage in continuous assessment. This has the advantage of spreading assessment over the entire period of the course. The NCCA, as a body representative of the interests involved, has not brought forward proposals for such forms of assessment at leaving certificate because there is no acceptance by some stakeholders of such an approach in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of the leaving certificate and its wide usage as a selection instrument for both work and further study, the senior cycle committee of the NCCA is prioritising the continuing review, reform and implementation of the subjects that make up the leaving certificate curriculum. Broadening the range of assessment components is being addressed in that review. This committee is made up of representatives of organisations from the world of work and further education. The demands made on the leaving certificate as a selection instrument and the case for broadening the assessment techniques are very much to the fore in their thinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is a difficult issue and that progress can only be made through consultation and co-operation with the various education partners, particularly the teachers' unions. In schools, primary and post-primary, one of the major concerns for parents and teachers is lack of discipline. Does the Minister agree with me that if a student knew his behaviour in school, from his first day in primary to his final day in leaving certificate, would be part of the overall evaluation and marks which he receives, it may address the disciplinary problems? Would the Minister consider that previous examinations while attending school should be taken on board? The opportunity for repeat leaving certificate in certain subjects should be offered rather than the obligation to repeat the entire year. Does he agree that the leaving certificates, vocational and applied, are useful starting points on which to build in consultation with teachers' unions?</P>

      <P>It is not insurmountable but that is where the problems arise. The Deputy mentioned consultation. The NCCA, which represents the interests involved, did not bring forward proposals for such forms of assessment at leaving certificate because some stake holders do not accept this approach. I agree with the Deputy that is an area we should expand. The applied and <Col N="568" /> vocational leaving certificates are leading the way. There are credits in the applied and they have the benefits, mentioned by the Deputy, like discipline, participation and recognition as the student progresses. We have a fine system but it is a big one and we must bear in mind that it must suit the needs of the individual pupil. Continuous assessment is something from which pupils can benefit. Consultations are continuing and the senior cycle committee of the NCCA is prioritising that issue for review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the general principle that the leaving certificate examination is a snapshot of a student's capacity which becomes cast in concrete and determines his employment prospects and advancement to third level? That is unfair in principle. If we accept that as a starting point, we can move on to negotiating with the stakeholders, the parents and teachers, how to improve the situation. What has been achieved to date in terms of the applied and vocational is a useful model on which to build in terms of assessment.</P>

      <P>The introduction of social, personal and health education (SPHE), as part of the curriculum at primary and post-primary levels, represents the specific strategy being followed by my Department to provide young people with life skills and moral education. SPHE addresses issues such as substance misuse, both alcohol and drugs, relationships and sexuality education and suicide. In providing for SPHE as part of the curriculum, my Department is discharging its responsibility towards the educational dimension of children and young peoples' formation. Significant measures were taken to ensure that quality SPHE programmes are introduced into all schools. Other groups, agencies and individuals also have significant responsibilities in the formation of young people. These include parents, church bodies and society in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, in relation to the contribution that schools may make to the concerns raised by the Deputy, SPHE programmes that are planned and consistent throughout the individual school, will enable children and young people to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and life skills that will inform their decisions and actions both during their time in school and in <Col N="569" /> their future lives. As SPHE has a moral and spiritual dimension, its development and implementation is influenced significantly by the ethos and characteristic spirit of the school. The manner in which SPHE is being introduced accommodates this position.</P>
    <P>Support for the introduction of social, personal and health education as part of the primary school curriculum will begin in Autumn 2001, when all primary teachers will attend professional development programmes to enable them teach the curriculum. This will build on the training programmes already provided in areas which form part of SPHE: the child abuse prevention programme, relationships and sexuality education and the substance misuse prevention programme. The support programme for SPHE will continue for two academic years. A major relationships and sexuality education support programme has been provided for primary and post primary schools and support for these programmes at both levels is continuing.</P>
    <P>As part of its strategy to counteract the effects of educational disadvantage, the Government has established the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS. This is an executive agency of my Department with devolved responsibility for the provision of educational psychological services to primary and post-primary schools. NEPS psychologists provide a consultation service to the teachers and parents of students who are distressed and may also engage in short-term counselling of such students. The psychologists act in close collaboration with the health boards, especially over the arrangement of more intensive, long-term support for particular individuals and families. NEPS has a general remit to promote mental health in schools and, in this context, psychologists may assist schools in drafting a school policy on education in life skills, within the framework of school development planning.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that many young people are in crisis? Given our position at the top of the scale in Europe for drug and alcohol use among young people, and the high rates of young male suicide, there is a need for the SPHE to be pursued with vigour. This programme is a very fine one and it is provided in a planned and consistent way. However, that is not so in the case of all schools. Will the Minister tell us the proportion of post-primary schools in which the programme is being fully provided with trained staff? It is my understanding that quite a few schools do not provide the programme. Further to his comments on the proposal to introduce the programme at primary level, will the Minister tell us the timescale he has in mind?</P>

      <P>An evaluation of both programmes was carried out by an external independent consultant. The evaluation of the walk tall programme was carried out among teachers who had been involved with it, and the satisfaction rating in regard to the training received and the materials provided was particularly high. I accept what the Deputy says. These programmes are very important. They are being integrated into the school system, but it takes time to get them fully operational because much training is required and that involves absence from classes.

      <P>That sounds like a long-playing record. We heard, at the height of the ASTI dispute, that the Minister had adequate contingency plans. Is the Minister not aware that, even in an environment of full co-operation from all the teachers' unions, many of the practical examinations are not being carried out with the efficiency the Minister's response suggests? Let me draw the Minister's attention specifically to the issue facing numerous students at junior and leaving certificate level in regard to the home economics practical examinations, where practical examinations which had been arranged failed to be undertaken because of an insufficiency of examiners.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that one of the lessons to be learned from the ASTI dispute is the need to remove from the Department of Education and Science responsibility for organising, administering, supervising and examining the junior and leaving certificate examinations? This was flagged in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report and more recently in the Cromien report. Has the Minister any proposals to bring before the House in that regard?</P>
      <P>Given that numerous students all over the country lost in the region of 15 days tuition because of the ASTI dispute, has the Minister any proposals to bring to the attention of examiners of junior and leaving certificate scripts that certain students will be at a distinct disadvantage relative to some of their counterparts? What proposals has the Minister to rectify that?</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the economic benefits which would accrue to the north-west region from the establishment of a university in Sligo, the Government will, under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, appoint the necessary body to advise the Higher Education Authority on the upgrading of Sligo Institute of Technology to university status.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans at present to change the status of the Institute of Technology in Sligo. In July 1996, the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector, subject to regular review. The steering committee report endorsed the maintenance of a diversified system of higher education to meet the varying needs of students, society and the economy. The report did not recommend any change in status for the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to publication of the steering committee's report, arrangements were put in place for a process to enable institutes to apply for delegated authority to make awards within a national qualifications framework. This process was initiated through the appointment of an interim review group chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly. As part of this process, the interim review group undertook an academic review of the institute of technology in Sligo. This academic review, which was published in March 2000, recommended that the institute of technology in Sligo would have the delegated power to make awards in respect of national certificate and diploma courses.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 29(8) of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, will enable me to give effect to the recommendations of the review group and I propose to do so when the relevant sections of the Act are brought into operation in the near future.</P>
      <P>My policy is to continue to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level systems of university and technological education. The diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements. The institute of technology in Sligo will continue to play a major role in Irish higher education.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the reply because it did not answer the question I asked as to whether the Minister would consider putting together a committee from the Higher Education Authority to consider the establishment of a university in the north-west region. Of all third level educated graduates in the north-west, only 6.6% find work in the north-west region, while 65% find work on the east coast. Of all third level educated graduates from Leitrim, only 7.4% find work in their own county, 6.8% in Roscommon and 14% in Sligo. It is imperative for the economic and educational development of the north-west region that a university is established. I ask the Minister to step up a committee within the Higher Education Authority to investigate this as a matter of urgency.</P>

I went on to say that the review group submitted a report on the institute of technology in Sligo recommending that the institute should have the delegated power to make awards in respect of all NCEA validated national certificate and diploma courses. The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, which has recently been brought into operation, enables the Minister to formally implement this recommendation for delegated authority, and that is for degree awarding status. That is what I hope to be able to do shortly. That qualifications body is now in place.</P>

      <P>There is a brain drain from the north-west region. Does the Minister agree that a university campus would attract high value added companies to the area, because that is not happening in the north-west? There is also the issue of cross-Border co-operation. A number of students from Border counties such as Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry attend third level education in the South. If a university was established in the north-west region, many of those students could attend university there. Will the Minister look at this unique situation in relation to Sligo IT and St. Angela's College which are providing third level education in the region and have them upgraded to university status? It is something that the Higher Education Authority should be requested to investigate specifically.</P>

A considerable amount of development has to take place before it reaches university status. There are two separate lines here in any event. If Sligo Institute of Technology wants to become a university, it has to qualify under the academic criteria and that was the purpose of the academic review.</P>

      <P>The teacher allocation to an individual second level school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school at the end of the preceding September. It is open to the authorities of the school to seek a concessionary allocation to cater for curricular needs within the school.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, it is a matter for the authorities of the school concerned, having regard to available teaching resources and the requirements with regard to the provision of the core curriculum, to decide on the curriculum to be provided and the subject choices to be offered to the pupils attending the school. Similarly, the appointment of teachers and the subject areas to be catered for are matters to be decided by the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1999, the Government decided that suitable provision should be made for PE facilities when new second level schools are being planned or when existing schools are being extended. This initiative means that all new schools that have an enrolment in excess of 450 students qualify for a PE hall of 608 square metres. This area refers to the floor area of the hall and does not take account of ancillary accommodation, which can add in excess of a further 200 square metres to the overall size of the facility. Schools that have an enrolment of between 200 and 449 students qualify for a PE hall of 406 square metres. Again ancillary accommodation can add a further 200 square metres of accommodation to this floor area, giving a total area in excess of 600 square metres. The needs <Col N="577" /> of smaller schools in relation to PE facilities are assessed on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>When planning new second level school buildings and extensions to existing buildings, provision for a PE hall is integrated into the overall plans. The needs of schools that do not have a PE hall and do not have a capital project in planning will be addressed by using generic PE hall templates, which are currently being developed within the building unit of my Department. The templates will standardise the construction of PE halls in second level schools and will reduce the architectural planning processes considerably. The templates are being piloted in four schools initially and are expected to be available for widespread application later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spent quite a long time telling us he has no plans for PE in second level schools. We have one PE inspector nationally. Will he provide grant aid to schools which want to provide PE as a leaving certificate subject? From what the Minister has said it seems he has no such plans. For the past month we have been discussing funding of £1 billion for sports facilities and still at second level we are not providing one penny. Facilities which have been provided have been funded by parents and other groups. What will the Minister do to upgrade PE and how many inspectors will he provide in his Department so there can be proper PE education to examination level? The Minister has decided that PE can be taken as a leaving certificate examination subject. It is another example of how the Minister is trying to provide education on a shoestring budget. The PR and spin doctors are focusing on the £1 billion&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of requests by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding. As the Deputies will be aware the funding arrangements for our schools have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the sectoral division of our second level system.</P>
      <P>I have already made it clear in the House that I consider the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under continuing review. At the core of the recommendations are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the principal issue is one of equity between the voluntary second schools, and VEC community schools, community colleges and comprehensive schools which get a bigger budget from the Department for caretaker, secretarial and minor repairs? Notwithstanding what the Minister said about the school services support fund which gave an increase across the board, will he bridge the gap between voluntary schools and VEC community and comprehensive schools? Does the accept there is an enormous administrative burden on secondary and primary schools in terms of health and safety, liaison with parents and all the additional duties we have imposed on them in recent years arising from the Education and Welfare Act, the Education Act which requires them to publish annual plans and the establishment of the NEPS? Without increased secretarial support they are simply unable to meet their obligations. The Minister is aware of this as the schools are not publishing their plans due to lack of resources. Will the Minister enable them fulfil their legal obligations by bridging the gap and providing realistic funds in particular for administrative and secretarial work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a matter of equity, but this has arisen because of the traditional situation. It is another of the great gaps which must be closed. Currently, under the free education scheme all schools with enrolments of upwards of 200 pupils are now receiving grants for caretakers and secretaries, unless they were in the 1978 scheme under which full salaries are paid. There are a number of schools in this scheme. I want to do more in this area.</P>
      <P>The support fund applied to those schools, but also applied across the board, and I appreciate that point has been made by the joint managerial board, for example. I plan to continue dealing with the issue of equity, which is important and which applies in particular to caretakers, insurance and other such matters.</P>

      <P>A huge amount of time and energy went into preparing the Blackstock report. Does the Minister accept it is quite insulting to those involved in preparing the report to set it aside and merely say it will inform policy? The Minister has accepted there is a significant funding gap between the voluntary secondary school sector and other post primary sectors. Does the Minister intend to close that gap no matter how long it takes? Everybody deserves to know where he stands on this issue. Does he not accept that at this stage in our social and economic development the State should meet the full cost of running all public schools?</P>

      <P>Over the past three and a half years we have increased the budget for education by 70%, which is a huge extra provision. It is indicative of the fact that so many gaps need to be filled. This is one with which I will continue.</P>

      <P>The question of FÁS and the community employment scheme is important and topical. I am aware of what is involved, not only in terms of the schools but also in the social welfare area where it applies. I hope the matter will be resolved shortly.</P>

      <P>Although the numbers involved may dwindle, the money allocated will be fixed at a certain amount.

Their future involvement must also be addressed to ensure <Col N="582" /> they are not excluded. These aspects are the subject of agreement between FÁS, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department.

      <P>The recent Labour Court recommendation and subsequent clarification proposed that a forum be put in place to conduct an expert review of education. The Deputy and I discussed this in the House some time ago. At the root of this recommendation was the considered view of the court that in the context of the changed and still rapidly changing educational environment, there is a need for a fundamental examination of all aspects of learning and teaching. The expert review group will involve the partners in education and will have terms of reference covering a wide range of issues, including legal and management structures, developments in education and teaching, the role of the teacher, teacher training and accreditation and support systems for schools and teachers.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have promised such a group or commission. I am currently developing proposals on the establishment of the commission and will consult the education partners on its composition over the coming weeks.

The last such examination was before the mid-1960s and so much has happened in the interim it is very important to re-examine this area.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>In January last, I announced the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. This programme will cost over £26 million over a three year period. There are a number of other programmes in place to address educational disadvantage at both primary and second level. These include the Early Start pilot project, Breaking the Cycle pilot project in primary schools, the home-school-community liaison <Col N="584" /> scheme and the 8-15 early school leaver initiative which cover both levels, the stay in school retention initiative at second-level, and learning and support teachers.</P>
      <P>Each of the interventions outlined is, or will be, monitored by my Department's inspectorate to ensure that it addresses the needs of the educationally disadvantaged pupils being targeted and that where modifications in programme content or mode of delivery are required, the necessary changes are made to incorporate these. Some of the initiatives have also been externally evaluated.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that all programmes funded by my Department be subject to external review by independent experts in order to ascertain whether the programme objectives are being achieved and the needs of the target group are being catered for in an efficient and effective manner. For this reason, the new programme has a built &ndash; in external evaluation and review mechanism. I have also made arrangements to have all major initiatives in the area of educational disadvantage externally evaluated by independent experts. A register of competent evaluators is currently being compiled for this purpose. I expect that the first of these reviews, that of the home-school-community liaison scheme, will commence shortly. Officials from the relevant areas within my Department will oversee each review.</P>

In terms of prioritising that evaluation, will the Minister ensure that where initiatives are available at primary school level, and are seen to be working, that the safety net is not dropped in the transition from primary to secondary level? The administration in the Department where there is a primary and a secondary school section means that, very often, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. I ask the Minister to zone in on that transition period in terms of evaluation to ensure that the safety net remains in place.</P>

This is a continuing process which will enable pupils to be followed up without delay. The evaluators will be examining the effectiveness of all these schemes.</P>
      <P>I listed the wide range of schemes that are in existence. The funding is not 25%, it is £25,000. That is a very beneficial change which has been made. It is £10,000 for a school regarded as a disadvantaged school.</P>

      <P>That is a benefit for a start. Schools with a high proportion of disadvantaged pupils need to be considered in relation to that £10,000 as against £25,000. Every one of these costs millions of pounds but that is the direction we are taking.</P>

      <Col N="586" /> Some 2,370 schools qualified so more than that number actually responded. A good number of those were also for the minimum level. The study undertaken by the Educational Research Centre was a good one. It gave a clearer picture of where the numbers of disadvantaged pupils are located.</P>
    <P>There has been a very big increase in the numbers of resource teachers, from 199 to 850. I am subject to correction on the figures. We hope to continue to increase the support for children in need of that help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about Irish neutrality and the grounds on which we should go beyond traditional neutrality and making the case that for us to lose our neutrality by stealth was wrong, that we should, on terms favourable to Ireland, decide the basis for our departure from neutrality. A key part of the debate on this treaty should have been about Europe's developing security architecture and how we see Ireland's role in that architecture.</P>
      <P>The Nice Treaty, despite all the usual outlandish claims of its opponents, does not mark the end of Irish neutrality. The ultimate decision on whether Irish forces will be committed to any foreign mission remains with the representatives of the Irish people in this House. However, the treaty recognises the growing security and defence aspects of the Union. We should not deny that. It is time we embraced them and dealt with them openly and stopped allowing Paisleyite type closed-mind tactics to back this country into ending neutrality by stealth in the worst possible circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Maastricht assigned a role to the Western European Union carrying out EU decisions, which had defence implications. As the EU's capabilities in this area have increased so the role of the Western European Union has diminished. This reality will now be effected in changes to Article 17 of the treaty which delete references to the Western European Union. In addition a political and security committee based in Brussels will replace the existing political committee comprising representatives from capitals and this is reflected in an amendment to Article 25 of the EU Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growing defence and security aspect of the EU is recognition of the reality that Europeans will, in the future, have to take the lead on security matters in Europe. Recent events in the Balkans have served to confirm the reality that the <Col N="588" /> United States is no longer willing to do what Europeans should do for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Union is intimately involved in the development of a new security architecture for the continent, based on core values and new models of conflict prevention and, when necessary, conflict resolution. That the Irish Government has participated in these discussions and acquiesced to these developments without adequate discussion at home shows that it has learned nothing from its mishandling of the partnership for peace and that security and defence policy is being made in an unplanned way. Furthermore, it is being done in a way which is likely to cause maximum suspicion among the electorate, and without any explanation to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion of Deputy Quinn for a national forum on European policy bringing together the political parties, social partners and interested groups, pro and anti further integration. Fine Gael believes the way to pursue and develop foreign and security policy is to put the issues properly before the people, the pros and cons of possible Irish policy should be articulated and debated. As EU security and defence policy evolves this too should be articulated at home. Regrettably Ministers continue to run away from proactively developing policy in this area or even explaining proposals or developments to the public. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. I invite the Minister of State opposite and other Ministers not to allow themselves to be cowed by Paisley-type politics. That has caused terrible ruin to the best interests of the people in Northern Ireland and it is causing terrible ruin to people in the Republic because others will make rules and we will join by stealth. Let us be one of the people who make the rules and let us do so on our terms.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael party has set out clearly its vision of Ireland's future in the policy document Beyond Neutrality &ndash; Ireland's role in European Defence and Security. Fine Gael believes the time has come to manage developments in this area and not simply to react to them. It is time for Ireland to become one of the architects in designing future European security and defence structures.</P>
    <P>In its policy document, Fine Gael sets out the principles it believes should be the basis of a future EU common defence policy of which Ireland would be a part. These principles include adherence to the fundamental principles of the United Nations; a commitment to the vigorous pursuit of the goal of universal nuclear and biological disarmament and to a solemn undertaking by a European Defence Union acting as an entity not to use nuclear or biological weapons; a commitment to mutual defence and support among all EU member states but based on an Article V type protocol &ndash; Article V of the Western European Union Treaty &ndash; opt-in arrangements for <Col N="589" /> those states which do not want to make this an automatic provision; a commitment, as a priority, to the provision of resources to UN-mandated peace-keeping and peace-making operations and to the Petersberg Tasks of the Western European Union &ndash; humanitarian aid, search and rescue, peace-keeping and peace enforcement including tasks of combat forces on a case by case basis and respect for the right of other member states, if they so wish, to be involved in other military alliances, such as NATO.</P>
    <P>With these principles in place we could change our policy on neutrality in the most advantageous circumstances from Ireland's viewpoint. If Ireland's neutrality ends at some future date, based on evolving rules largely made by others, and with little pro-active input from our own Government, mainly based on fear of telling the electorate the truth and being caught out on previous lies, and based on failure of leadership, we will have the worst of all worlds. It is time for Ireland to advocate a European Defence entity on terms which meet our concerns.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that by advocating a European defence entity based on these five principles and with mutual defence obligations, as set out in Article V of the Western European Union Treaty, as a non-binding protocol on current EU neutrals we would win a measure of support across the Union which would have good prospects of implementation.</P>
    <P>It is time to stop making security and defence policy by stealth. As the record of this Government shows, this is the surest way to build public opposition to such initiatives, and to the EU as a whole.</P>
    <P>As mentioned by previous speakers the Treaty of Nice equips the Union with the machinery to enlarge from the current 15 to as many as 27 within the next decade or so. The opportunity exists to end the historic division of our continent which brought so much grief and destruction in the 20th century to so many of our fellow Europeans. We can build a better more stable more prosperous and more secure future for our children.</P>
    <P>I call on the public to support the treaty and I call on the Government to learn the lesson of its failures over the past four years and to open an inclusive debate on Ireland's role, including our role in security and defence matters in the European Union of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I hope this House will show there are other Members, including some on the Government side, who are prepared to stand up and say it is time for us to take our share of responsibility in security and defence matters in Europe and to try to do it on the terms we want. It is time we became one of the architects and stopped allowing other people make the rules. It is beyond time we took on the Paisleyite people in this State who have taken on to themselves a <Col N="590" /> righteousness which they have no right to do because they are doing it over the dead bodies of 60 million Europeans in the main who lost their lives in the first half of the last century. If we want security, stability and the prosperity that flows from that essential prerequisite then we have to put our shoulders to the mill and play our part in ensuring that that security, stability and prosperity continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats strongly advocate the ratification of the Nice Treaty. This legislation is to enable the people to express their support for the further enlargement of the European Union. Our party will campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum.</P>
      <P>The Nice Treaty is about the hope of a stable, peaceful and prosperous future for the nations of Europe. It is about creating an EU which is ready and able to welcome as many as 13 new member states and 180 million new people. This is a truly historic undertaking. The 12 applicant countries and Turkey stretch from the small maritime states of the Baltic to the small island states in the Mediterranean. They include the historic and venerable nations of central and eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The applicant countries include many people who have only briefly in their history enjoyed democracy, peace and stability. They suffered terribly in the 20th century from internal as well as external oppression. At the beginning of the 21st century we can offer them the chance to secure a peaceful and democratic future in rock solid democratic institutions.</P>
      <P>We must not let this debate pass without bringing the real stories of these nations to the people of Ireland. What do we know about them? Do we understand their past, their present needs, their hopes and their hopes of us? After the traumas of the First World War and the break up of the old empires, the early seeds of parliamentary government were overwhelmed by fascism and totalitarianism in many central and eastern European countries. &ldquo;Nor could they survive&rdquo;, one historian wrote, &ldquo;in the face of bitter ethnic rivalries. By the end of the 1930s, right wing dictatorships had overwhelmed political liberalism in each eastern European nation, except Czechoslovakia&rdquo;. Country after country succumbed to authoritarian rule, internal oppression, political instability and economic stagnation. Bloodletting and the savage oppression of people continued throughout the 20th century and, in Balkan states, effectively up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scale of the achievement of ending that oppression once and for all, which becomes possible within European institutions, would be magnificent. I will not recount today the suffering of the European continent in the Second World War or the external and internal denial of freedom and human rights that followed across central and <Col N="591" /> eastern Europe. However, we should never gloss over this part of European history, our shared history. These events are still within the living memory of many millions of people. It is only in the last decade or so that many of the applicant member states to the European Union have had any hope of a stable, liberal democracy based on respect for human rights, the rule of law and economic progress.</P>
    <P>Sometimes Irish people take their democratic and parliamentary history too much for granted. In comparison with many European nations, we have had a high degree of peace and stability, notwithstanding the War of Independence, the Civil War and, most recently, paramilitary violence in the North. This must give us pause to reflect but should also lead us to actions and the right decisions. It is not too much to ask of Irish people that we share the foundations of our peace, stability and prosperity with other nations on our continent and elsewhere. As a people we have benefited greatly from European structural assistance and other acts of European solidarity. We, who are seen by many as a model of the strength of the European idea and integration, should be the loudest voice in support of further enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <P>When we refer to the 180 million people of the applicant countries, we should consider the rich cultural and historic diversity of the nations from which they come. The EU is now actively engaged in enlargement negotiations with 12 countries and will expand during this decade from a membership of 15 to 27. For this to take place, we must adopt the changes agreed in the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>The candidate countries engaged in enlargement negotiations with the EU represent, for the greater part, countries that historically belong in the European family of nations but who, because of the outcome of the Second World War, found themselves cut off from developments in Europe for 50 years. Enlargement offers the opportunity to welcome them back to their natural homeland. I am speaking of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania. Cyprus and Malta are also actively involved in negotiations for membership of the EU and Turkey has been granted candidate status. The names of many of these countries resonate through European history and their people have greatly influenced the development of European culture.</P>
    <P>The candidate countries from central and eastern Europe have made tremendous efforts in recent years to prepare their economies and structures for membership of the EU. Their leaders have invested their hopes for the future of their nations in EU membership. They are successfully moving their economies from a centrally planned, non-competitive basis to open market, free trading structures and they have engaged in major administrative and political reforms in order to restore full respect for human rights and <Col N="592" /> to comply with international treaty objectives. These changes have not occurred easily or without considerable hardship. As a country which has benefited greatly from membership of the European Union, Ireland has been happy to lend assistance and advice to the candidate countries where possible.</P>
    <P>Major progress has been made by all candidates in enlargement negotiations and the most advanced countries among them should be prepared to join the EU over the next few years. Their future rests with Europe as Europe's future rests with them. Their membership of the EU will also bring great benefits to the current member states. In Ireland's case, it will increase the size of the Single Market which is of major importance to the economy. Enlargement is also central to the future security and peace of Europe. An enlarged Europe will be better able to deal with transnational problems of drug trafficking, organised crime and trafficking in people.</P>
    <P>Our sense of solidarity with the applicant states is a function of our wider solidarity with less fortunate nations. The evidence lies in our people's commitment to overseas aid and emergency relief. The European Community is the largest donor of multilateral development aid in the world. It is the fifth largest donor of development aid and the largest donor of humanitarian assistance. While the Community programme of development co-operation has been much criticised, it makes an important global contribution to the fight against poverty and has helped millions of people in the developing world.</P>
    <P>The Community is also the major donor to the countries of eastern Europe and central Asia. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economies of these countries were plunged into turmoil. Mismanaged transitions to market oriented economic systems have resulted in a huge increase in poverty. In 1988, the World Bank estimated that one million people in eastern Europe and central Asia lived in extreme poverty, which is defined as an income of less than $1 per day. By 1998, the number had increased to 24 million, a level of poverty which is normally associated with sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, more than 160 million people in the region live below the poverty line, of which at least 50 million are children. These are people living within driving distance of the countries of central Europe.</P>
    <P>The flow of economic migrants from this region into western Europe, including Ireland, is a stark reminder of how the rapid increase in poverty has impelled many people to seek a better life in the more developed countries. We know there are people living in Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland who have fled appalling deprivation in their home countries to find a new life in our thriving economy.</P>
    <P>Such a profound income and development gap on the continent of Europe is a cause of serious concern. It poses huge challenges to the European Union which is greatly increasing its development assistance to the region. The people <Col N="593" /> of eastern Europe and central Asia look to the European Union for their future economic development. The Community is seen as their most important strategic partner in their efforts to deal with the collapse of their economies and the rise in poverty. It is, of course, also in the Community's interests to ensure that these countries develop into stable and prosperous democracies.</P>
    <P>Rather than losing their people through economic migration and relying on large levels of Community assistance, the people in this region need to attract the trade and investment which, as Ireland has seen, is fundamental to economic development. Nobody in Ireland would deny the poor of the region the opportunity to make a better life for themselves through the development of their political, economic and trade relations with the European Union.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to achieve this great goal of enlargement in a reasonable time without changing the EU decision making processes. Critics say that the Nice Treaty changes the original nature of the Union or the Community by allowing countries to engage in &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo;. The EU is changing. It has changed a lot since it was a Community of just six member states which Ireland joined nearly 30 years ago. Ireland's relations within the EU will change too. Our pattern of trade and diplomacy will be altered by enlargement. Surely we must recognise that we have not built our peace and prosperity on our own, that we received critical help from our friends abroad, both on the economic and political fronts, in the public and private sectors? Our friends in Europe, in the United States, in Australia and beyond have helped us become what we are today on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It was never a matter of &ldquo;ourselves alone&rdquo; in Ireland. The whole European Union project since the 1950s has itself been the very antithesis of &ldquo;ourselves alone&rdquo;. It has been &ldquo;we together&rdquo;, we, the people, nations and states of Europe, pooling sovereignty for the great goal of mutual prosperity and stability. It is grimly consistent of Sinn Féin, a party of narrow nationalism, to oppose the Nice Treaty and the enlargement of the European Union. The party of narrow nationalism cannot rise beyond its own name to embrace a shared future for all the peoples of Europe and it is also a black irony to hear the party of the paramilitary republican movement falsely accusing the legitimate governments of the European Union of increased militarism, an irony that will not be lost on the Irish people. Here we have Sinn Féin looking for the demilitarisation of the whole European continent, while the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons is painfully slow in one small part of Europe.</P>
    <P>Those of us who favour the Nice Treaty must appeal to the strong strain of generosity in the Irish people. This will contrast with the appeal to fear and insular approval of many of those who are opposing the Treaty. During the Amsterdam Treaty referendum, the slogan was put out: &ldquo;If <Col N="594" /> you don't know, vote no.&rdquo;  That was an appeal to ignorance and suspicion, saying: &ldquo;If you feel ignorant, stay ignorant&rdquo; and it showed a very poor view of the intelligence and attitudes of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Like it or not, many people do feel ill-informed about EU decisions. As politicians, we should say this is a problem to be solved, not one in which to wallow. The Government has indicated that it is actively considering new arrangements to provide for an extended national debate on EU issues in this jurisdiction in parallel with the debate on the future development of the Union which, as agreed at Nice, is getting under way across the member states.</P>
    <P>Other opponents of the Nice Treaty say it is not about enlargement but about the larger states getting more power, and small countries like Ireland losing power. The fall in Ireland's voting weight at the Council of Ministers from 3.4% of the total now, to 2.95% in a Union of 15 members in 2005 and 2% in a Union of 27 member states is the cause for their wild alarm. A fall of 0.45% in our voting weight at the same time as larger countries have lost their second Commissioner is a minor change and seems to me to be a fair balance.</P>
    <P>The wider point, however, is that opponents of the treaty have no positive suggestions to offer as to how enlargement can practically be achieved. Do they really think a European Union of 27 member states can operate as it did when there were six, nine or 15 members? Have they put forward any practical suggestions? Did they recommend an alternative and viable negotiating strategy for the Nice summit, recognising the legitimate needs and positions of all member states? No, they never did because the politics of the Greens, of Sinn Féin and of single issue pressure groups are the lazy politics of opposition, of constant, unconstructive and grievance-laden opposition. What are they saying to the peoples of the applicant countries? Their bottom line is that they simply do not recommend that any country should join us in the EU if we ratify Nice. We in Ireland have a lot more than that to offer the applicant countries. We can offer a positive, constructive approach in a Union that will operate effectively for all its member states.</P>
    <P>What are the opponents saying to the people of Ireland? They claim that Nice will mean Ireland will be absorbed in an EU federal superstate. We are against a European federal superstate too and I would not recommend the Irish people to vote for one, no matter who puts forward the idea. However, that is decidedly not what the Nice Treaty does.</P>
    <P>These opponents claim the Nice Treaty removes our national sovereignty. We have maintained in the Nice Treaty a crucial national veto on tax policy, the core of economic democracy. As far as I am concerned, Ireland should continue to hold this position. and for that reason the Progressive Democrats can recommend a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on Nice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The opponents claim Ireland is getting caught up in a military commitment in the EU. That is nonsense. The Treaty of Nice in no way expands or alters the scope of the Petersberg task provisions as contained in the Amsterdam Treaty and as already approved by the Irish people. It contains no security and defence provisions beyond very limited changes to the existing provisions for the common foreign and security policy which are intended to make it more coherent, more effective and more visible. The Treaty of Nice does not introduce a mutual defence commitment into the EU. The EU is not a military alliance and is not about to become one. Otherwise, why would countries which want to be in a military alliance want to join NATO as well as the EU?</P>
    <P>In Ireland the Government will decide on a case-by-case basis which EU peace-keeping and crisis management actions we will take part in. These will be only with UN sanction and Oireachtas approval will also be needed in accordance with the terms of relevant Irish legislation. The Irish people are proud of the peace-keeping record of the Irish military forces and of the gardaí and I am confident that they will continue to back our positive engagement in the creation of EU crisis management capabilities. Our firm attachment to our policy of military neutrality has been expressed clearly and unambiguously on numerous occasions, including to our EU partners, and we are not interested in joining military alliances.</P>
    <P>What we are interested in is playing our part in contributing to international efforts to respond to events such as those we have all witnessed in the Balkans over the past decade. Europe needs to be able to move quickly and effectively in response to such humanitarian crises. We will play our part in a manner which reflects the values which have always been at the heart of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I wish to broaden the debate about the developing European Union in this context. My party believes it is also important that Ireland should engage fully in the content of the policies of the Union, across all policy areas, as well as the structures for decision-making. Europe must have the right policies, as well as the right structures.</P>
    <P>If we are going to achieve an enterprise economy and fair society across the whole Union, that will be the result of the right type of policies the Union and member states pursue. Our policies together in the Union and as individual member states do influence whether we achieve the quality, sustained employment we want, whether businesses create jobs and replenish the supply of jobs when old jobs are lost, and whether risk-taking, research and development find a supportive environment.</P>
    <P>The European Union is not all about structures, procedures and rules. It must be and is about shared policies that deliver real progress. <Col N="596" /> As a party in the European liberal democratic political tradition, the Progressive Democrats believe the best policies are ones which involve a light burden of Government intervention in the economy, across all areas. We believe we should clear the way for all forms of enterprise-business, community and individual enterprise. Our policies are based on human rights, the rule of law and respect for individual freedom. We seek peace, prosperity and security in a liberal, fair, democratic order.</P>
    <P>I am glad this viewpoint has proponents among member states, in the Commission and the Parliament. It is normal that there should be a healthy contest of ideas in all political institutions, the EU institutions included, and that points to the strength of the institutions themselves.</P>
    <P>Getting the policies right for Ireland and for the European Union is the most urgent task. Structure needs content. My party rejects attempts by the left, in Ireland and elsewhere, to paint the entire European Union into one political corner, a soft left corner that they themselves seek to own.</P>
    <P>Too many Irish commentators and politicians have fallen into the trap of debating European policy in terms which are almost exclusive to Britain: eurosceptic versus federalist, social democrat versus Tory conservative. The reality is that the European Union, our Union, holds within it a great diversity of political views. There is a strong grounding of support for the liberal, democratic position that the Progressive Democrats share. We are rooted in that long and proud European tradition which has been developed and influenced across Europe &ndash; in Britain, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries &ndash; and in the United States. Many of the challenges for policymakers are the same in Europe and in the United States. We do not accept the false dichotomy posed by some people between our belonging to Europe and our affinity with America. Why should Irish people be forced to choose between our European home and our American friends? The world is not divided into Europe and the United States. In making policy for Ireland and for the EU, we are making policy in an interconnected world. We cannot forget this or become inward looking, either in Ireland or in the EU.</P>
    <P>The fundamental challenge is how to secure sustained, high value employment, peace, stability and human rights in a global economy. That means we have to be forward-looking, we have to understand the trends and forces in the global economy, we have to position Ireland and build clear comparative advantage for Ireland in the EU and in the global economy. At the Nice Summit, the leaders of the European Union decided to open a more fundamental debate on the shape and direction of the European Union. Another conference will take place in 2004. The issues are profound for Ireland and for the European Union, and the German Chancellor has made one contribution to that debate in recent days. Other <Col N="597" /> European leaders have made important interventions in this ongoing debate, as has the Government. As a Government, as political parties, as members of Dáil Éireann and as citizens, we should and will continue to make our views clear, so there is no democratic deficit in the debate or its outcome. There are no foregone conclusions as the debate has yet to happen. The Nice Treaty enables the Union, as it is now, to welcome more members. Enlargement of the European Union is an opportunity, not a threat. It will be seen as the major act of greatness by the EU at the start of the 21st century. The Nice Treaty changes are reasonable compromises between member states to make enlargement possible. I believe the Irish people will see it this way and vote for the Nice Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words on this debate and I understand I am to share time with Deputy Neville.</P>
      <P>Many opponents of the Nice Treaty have used a stick to beat those in favour of it and have said the debate on its implementation has been rushed. It is unfortunate that we are having this referendum at the same time as three others, given that EU Heads of State have said there is no need to ratify the treaty before the end of 2002. The allegation that the debate has been rushed, allied to the confusion that may arise as a result of parties advocating &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes in the four different referenda will fuel a campaign of &ldquo;if you don't know, vote no&rdquo;, which would be extremely undesirable. The Government has made itself a hostage to fortune by its management of the organisation of the referenda.</P>
      <P>In considering the Nice Treaty, it is important to look at the overall development of Europe since the Second World War. The Treaty of Rome established the European Coal and Steel Community, initiated by the Benelux countries. The Union developed as the EEC which Ireland joined in the early 1970s, through the Single European Act in 1986, the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997 to the Nice Treaty which we are now ratifying. It is obvious, therefore, that there is a growing pooling of sovereignty with our European partners across a wide range of issues. It is important from a selfish economic perspective that we vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on polling day, but there are other fabulous reasons for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is often said that the public does not engage greatly with grand debate of this nature. If this topic was on the front page of <i>The Star</i> every day until polling day, the public would skip over that page and move on, as by its nature this is not an issue that greatly excites. I am always amazed, nonetheless, when those who feel aggrieved about a certain issue say &ldquo;I will take this all the way to Europe&rdquo;. It is important to remember that much of the economic and social progress we have made, as well as the cultural guarantees for minority groups and the rights that have been won by consumer groups and by human rights <Col N="598" /> activists, are often underpinned by initiatives that have their genesis at EU level. While much may not be known about the detail of the treaty, the overall understanding of what Europe has done for us is significantly higher than is believed, as it should be.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the European Union over nearly 30 years has played a significant role in our economic development, and has brought about changes in areas like human rights, consumer rights, economic rights and cultural rights. The Irish language is an example of the latter, as those who rightly try to safeguard its position often look to the EU as a saviour as it makes certain commitments to minority languages. Despite its growth from the original six countries to the 15, the EU has not become a homogenous cultural blot on the landscape and is unlikely to do so as it grows to 27 or 30 member states. The EU has fostered diversity, which is important.</P>
    <P>We should vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because we owe much of our economic success to funds from Europe which have allowed us to build our own economy. As we move from being a net beneficiary to a net contributor, we have to be aware that we are an exporting economy. A significant economic opportunity is provided by a market that will grow inexorably during the next ten to 20 years, from 15 countries to 27 and from 370 million inhabitants to more than 500 million. That is the <i>quid pro quo</i> in terms of what we will lose, whether one wishes to call it the begging bowl, the handout or the transfer of funds. We will make up the shortfall by grasping the market opportunities that will arise as the community grows.</P>
    <P>This treaty's facilitating of enlargement is more abstract and difficult to grasp for those who are not clued-in politically. Most people are familiar with the list of countries that want to join &ndash; Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and others. Member states need to be extremely conscious that there is a rim of countries outside those immediately interested in joining where political and economic stability needs to be fostered. This can be done only through economic assistance, as it is not sufficient to say we will increase to only 27 member states and that those outside the 27 can forget about being involved in the great European plan of enlargement for the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>As a small exporting economy, we know the truth of the phrase &ldquo;it is a small world&rdquo;. This is borne out by our agricultural industry, including our exports of beef to Russia, which is not one of the countries interested in joining the EU. It is in the best interests of this country and those of the EU as a whole, however, that the eastern flank of the Union is politically and economically stable. As we extend a welcoming hand to new member states, we must be willing to offer assistance to those outside the first rank of applicant countries to ensure the borders of the enlarged EU are politically and economically stable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> It is important we do not present Nice as something that it is not between now and polling day. The treaty is not exactly as we would have liked if we were drawing it up ourselves. The public will not allow itself to be short-changed by anyone who claims this treaty is a bed of roses. Certain aspects of the treaty would be different if we had our own way, although I do not mean to implicitly criticise the Government. When 15 countries come together to make decisions there must be give and take. We might believe that the Government gave too much in certain areas but I say that with the wisdom of hindsight and without being immediately <i>au fait</i> with the white heat of the negotiation table. The Government's political fig leaf is to say we did not concede on taxation policy and as a result it is acceptable to have greater qualified majority voting or to lose our Commissioner. That was never an issue but it has been a useful ploy to hide the Government's embarrassment on these issues. In accordance with the nature of political dialogue and debate, we have yielded certain concessions to facilitate enlargement of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The one issue which will stick out as offensive to most people is the fact that when the European Union is enlarged to the extent envisaged in the Nice Treaty to include 27 member states, we will lose our right to membership of the Commission at all times. Many would consider that a step too far. It is important to realise the danger of presenting this as a bed of roses and the optimum outcome for Ireland. We should not underestimate the intelligence of the Irish public. There are some bitter pills in the Treaty but overall it is worthy of our support. It is primarily designed to facilitate enlargement and improve decision making. Some of the compromises are more palatable than others but the danger is that it would be presented as the optimum solution to the negotiations. That would run the risk of insulting the intelligence of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose this Treaty have been opposing every step &ndash; the original decision to join, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty. I am referring in particular to Independent Deputies, Sinn Féin and the Green Party. In particular they constantly raise the red herring about Irish neutrality and NATO, and use scare tactics. How many times have Irish citizens sat in their living rooms and wrung their hands in despair when they watched television broadcasts of what is happening in former Yugoslavia, Bosnia or Rwanda. The instinctive human outcry is: &ldquo;Somebody should do something.&rdquo;  The reality is that we, as a State, cannot always say that somebody should do something. We have created a political entity which is worthy of defence but equally we have obligations to others in terms of our participation in PfP on a case by case basis in accordance with the Petersberg Tasks. We need to meet this debate head on because there is considerable <Col N="600" /> public support for getting involved on a humanitarian basis. It is not as if we are striking out to create an empire for the sake of it. It is primarily based on political and fundamental human rights and that is what should be informing us on our involvement on a case by case basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is important, as Deputy Creed stated, that the voting public is made aware of what is at issue because at present they do not fully comprehend the issues involved. The issue is very simply about the enlargement of the European Union and the Treaty of Nice will give effect to institutional changes to facilitate increasing the membership to 27.</P>
      <P>We must endeavour to involve ourselves as far as possible in the national debate because if we do not do so, there is a danger that the electorate will not respond to our call to come out and vote. There is always a danger then that the people who have been vocal down through the years in opposing the development of the European Union will have their way and win the vote. Therefore we, as responsible politicians, must be vigilant and bring the debate to the people and endeavour to explain what is involved and what is at stake at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>It is important that we would have a reasoned debate and that all the issues related to the treaty are fully understood. There should be adequate preparation of the facts and the implications in order to assist people in making a decision to accept or reject the Nice Treaty. Previous speakers have pointed out the concern about the short period of time allowed for the public debate. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution recommended a period of three months and I feel that such a period is required in order to develop an in-depth debate and allow people time to fully understand the issues. We do not want the slogan, &ldquo;If you do not know, vote no&rdquo;, to take hold.</P>
      <P>The fact that four referenda will be put to the people on the same day will create confusion. It would be interesting to ask people the meaning of the four amendments to the Constitution. It would be interesting to know the percentage of the population who understood the debates on the referenda which have taken place here over recent weeks. Do they know that one of the referenda will remove references in the Constitution to the death penalty and the possibility of ever restoring the death penalty? Do they know that one of the referenda has to do with the international criminal court? Perhaps they have some idea that one of the referenda has to do with orderly disciplinary procedures regarding the Judiciary because of the debate surrounding the Judicial Council, the contentious nature of this issue and the previous debates and discussions on the disciplinary procedures for, and the actions of, the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to introduce momentum and reasoned dialogue to the debate on the Nice Treaty. <Col N="601" /> The treaty is an indication of work in progress in the European Union. The construction of post-war Europe and now the post-Cold War Europe was never going to be achieved by one treaty or agreement. This treaty represents a stepping stone to the historical imperative of a European Union for the entire Continent to include the Baltic states, the Balkans and the islands of Cyprus and Malta. Twelve candidate countries are to be admitted over the next ten years. The Union will grind to a halt if the structures and institutions, created by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and left largely intact since then, are not replaced by a modern and efficient set of institutions.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice represents a decisive step in fashioning a new Europe. When we hear the popular rhetoric about the treaty, we should remember that this treaty neither sets up a European army nor introduces a common scale of moral values to the European Union. Its sole aim is to reform the institutions and structures of the Union to make them flexible and adaptable to a union comprising 25 or 30 member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland's success in recent years is due in no small way to our membership of the European Union and access to European markets. One must remember that the enlargement of the European Union will provide the Ireland with access to a European Union market of up to 550 million people as compared with the market of 370 million people which exists at present. Therefore, there are market opportunities for Ireland in an enlarged Europe.</P>
    <P>Many of the applicant states are as poor, if not poorer, than Ireland was when we joined the EEC in 1972. Many have only won freedom within the last decade. Their membership of the Union is essential for their own secure development. The representatives of those countries make it clear that their first priority in foreign policy is to secure membership of the European Union. While our days as net beneficiaries of EU funding are ending, the benefits of EU membership are not to be gauged merely by the financial flows. As an exporting country, the prospect of a European Union with a population of more than 550 million must be considered attractive.</P>
    <P>Endorsement of the Nice Treaty does not mean that Fine Gael endorses Government policy on Europe and its institutions. We look forward to the next intergovernmental conference due to get under way soon, which may be held when Ireland next holds the EU Presidency. It is important to have more debate in this House and outside on what Ireland should seek at that conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have a reservation about taking part in this debate, it is that the ongoing evolution of Europe should have been a matter of continuing debate in this Chamber for some considerable time. I regret we have used and abused our time in this House so constantly by spending an hour and a half on the Order of Business every day on personality focused nonsense <Col N="602" /> before taking on responsibility for continuing to inform our people who are being asked to make a decision on this important issue. Every other parliament in Europe has been engaging in continuing discussion and debate on the evolution of Europe, and properly so.</P>
      <P>The holding of a referendum on the Nice Treaty gives us the first opportunity to endorse it. As Europe continues to evolve, I hope we will act responsibly as a Parliament and have regular debate and discussion on issues before being forced to debate, in a short timeframe, a matter that will be decided by the Irish people, with all the possible consequences of distortion in any such debate.</P>
      <P>I regard this opportunity as a special privilege and obligation. My privileges and obligations derive from my being a member of the Council of Ministers in early 1973, after we joined the European Union. I may be the only surviving Member of this House who was a member of the Council of Ministers at that time. Deputy O'Malley may have been, but as far as I know there was no Council for industry for which he had responsibility at that time. I had the privilege of representing Ireland at the Council of Ministers for energy in 1973 and I have had a continuing association, as the Chair and the House will be aware, with European evolution since then.</P>
      <P>It is important to record the changes resulting from our membership of the Union and its impact on our people, especially our young people, and on our international reputation, particularly among our European partners. The late Seán Lemass was a very far-seeing progressive person. Since his time as Taoiseach, the policy has been to prepare our people for our involvement, in a vigorous and positive way, in Europe. Even the third level institutions, particularly that in Limerick, set up in my early days as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education in the 1960s, had one central focus. The theme was &ldquo;Ireland in Europe&rdquo; and our young people playing a full and vigorous part in that Europe. It is wonderful to look back and realise how that policy has been vindicated.</P>
      <P>Prior to our joining the European Economic Community in 1972, the average income per head here was 60% of the average income per head in the EEC while now it has almost doubled. That simple fact cannot be denied. Lawyers will say it is <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, the facts speak for themselves. Let those who want to challenge that fact produce the evidence to the contrary. Those who would challenge it would say we had a much higher proportion of income back then and we have a much lower one now, but that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the European Community started with the Benelux countries, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg getting together to ensure they could protect themselves against the possibility of another terrible war in which they were likely to be the victims. From that Benelux concept of co-operation at the centre of Europe came <Col N="603" /> the European Coal and Steel Community and, subsequently, the Treaty of Rome in 1957. When we joined their Community in 1972 it had six members and that number increased to nine with the accession of the United Kingdom, Denmark and ourselves. We wanted to be part of that Union of nine. Subsequently, the membership increased to 12 with the accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain. I was a member of the Council of Ministers for each of those periods and I remember the sense of impatience, expectation and, in the end, satisfaction on the part of our Portuguese, Spanish and Greek colleagues that at last they could join the European Community, as it was then. Subsequently that membership increased to 15 members.</P>
    <P>We would have resented the attitude of any one of those member states, much less a small element or small party in any one of them, preventing us playing a full and vigorous role in the European Community, preventing us reaping the rewards and enhancing our status and our confidence as a nation. We would have resented beyond anything, if a small rump in Holland, or another member state, brought down a barrier to our joining the Community, but none of those member states did that. Nonetheless, some in this House, and elsewhere, feel they have the right or entitlement to exclude from membership nations who have emerged from the dark night of communist oppression, and that is as about as gently as I can put it. Some suggest we should prevent those countries seeking accession to the Union benefiting from democratic partnership in Europe.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose this treaty should come clean and say they know the consequence of our rejecting the Nice Treaty in a referendum will be that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and others such as Latvia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Croatia and Slovenia will be blocked from gaining accession to the Union because we, in our selfish, little cosy nest, would say &ldquo;no, you may have struggled to gain your independence, freedom and dignity as individuals and as a people, but now that you are hoping to join in a democratic sharing of power and sovereignty in Europe, we will stop you.&rdquo;  Those who oppose this process should say precisely how they can justify that. Where were their voices and what did they say during the period of the Soviet oppression, the brutal oppression of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and many other countries?</P>
    <P>I do not remember those voices in those days when the Prague spring was a very short lived one and during the brutal Soviet repression of Hungary. I have met parliamentarians from Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and other countries, who look to Ireland, in particular &ndash; they are aware we will hold a referendum on the treaty &ndash; to open up a new avenue to enable them become equal partners in a European adventure from which, hopefully, they will reap the positive benefits we achieved from our membership of the Union. <Col N="604" /> That is a basic reality. Elements from the disparate left to the right wing of the Tory party, particularly those who oppose this treaty, and some elements from the extreme right wing in America see this as an opportunity of getting involved in funding and supporting the debate against our &ldquo;take-over&rdquo; by Europe, as some would like to put it. What a disparate group they are. They would each do well to reflect on the companions with whom they are involved.</P>
    <P>I recall a European Council meeting in Dublin, when Margaret Thatcher, who took a very negative view towards Europe, reduced the whole issue of European involvement to a nonsense by &ldquo;demanding her money back&rdquo;. She wanted to rule supreme in her own country and isolate herself from the influence of others in Europe. Unfortunately for the British people, that legacy is still too obvious. A number of right-wing Tories are still pursuing the same old chant. They wish the European idea had never emerged. They want to be masters of their own great destiny, as if they were still a world imperial power and they have some allies from the most unlikely sources in this country and in this House. That is a matter which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Ireland has done well in Europe because our people, our Government, our political parties generally, our business people and our workers have all taken a vigorous attitude towards it. They are out there gaining new markets and employment opportunities. On the other hand, the British enterprise sector and workers have been getting negative signals for some time. Consequently, they have not had a comparable level of achievement, considering all their advantages in international financial services, technology, trade and so on. They were ahead in all those areas, but not now, and this can be attributed to their lack of commitment. Every member state has some reservations but all can benefit by pooling resources and sharing a more significant sovereignty. The voices of Sinn Féin and others who have views on this issue were not heard when the countries concerned were being oppressed. Now, they are claiming Ireland will be overwhelmed unless they stand in the bearna baoil.</P>
    <P>I realise I am addressing a House which is relatively depopulated at the moment. There is also a notable absence of press commentators, who would all be there if we were having some nonsense on the Order of Business or engaging in the kind of personality issues which have become an unfortunate feature of discussions in this Chamber. That would provide headlines, but where are they now, when the real issues affecting the Irish people are being debated?</P>
    <P>I have met parliamentarians from Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other countries, who look to Ireland as an example of what they want to achieve. They see that the political and economic consequences for us have been enormous. The Irish people had been sheltered for so long and caught up in the Anglo-<Col N="605" /> American mainstream, with little real contact with our European blood brothers. Since we joined again in Europe, our young people, our business people and our workers are all benefiting from that renewed involvement and being enhanced in their attitudes. Of all countries, it is unthinkable that Ireland should block the entry into that common European democratic partnership of those countries recently released from oppression, brutality and dictatorship. Between 1994 and 1999, Irish exports to these applicant countries have increased by almost 350% to £586 million. Irish investment in Poland alone is now in excess of $1 billion. The Poles see that as a joint partnership with a country which they respect and whose example they can follow. The focus is very much on Ireland right now.</P>
    <P>The treaty, of course, also concerns the internal reorganisation of the institutions to accommodate the larger membership and ensure the institutions will be workable. I may be one of a small minority who doubt the need to refer such a treaty to the people, since it does not transfer any competence from the member states to the Union. Ireland is the only EU country to hold a referendum on this treaty. I have no reservations about the Irish people being asked to give their view, but the internal reorganisation of the Commission, Parliament and Council of Ministers is not a matter which in any way impinges on our sovereignty. That is my view, but now that it has been decided, we need a ringing endorsement.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to security and defence. Those matters have no connection whatsoever with the Nice Treaty. However, I have very strong reservations about the armaments exports of some of our European partners, euphemistically called Partners for Peace. The victims of that scandalous trade in weaponry and death are innocent people in Africa, South America or wherever. As members of the European Union, we owe it to those innocent victims to raise our voice against that amoral trade in which our partner countries are engaged. That is not an issue in the Nice Treaty but it is a matter on which our voice should be heard.</P>
    <P>I also have a reservation about the attitude of the EU in regard to animal health. I recall as Minister for Agriculture going to that same European Community when we did not have an outbreak of BSE with individual instances as distinct from Britain. I suggested to our European partners that we needed to have a proper regime to control animal disease in the interest of the market and that we needed to protect countries like Ireland with a disease free status. Unfortunately they did not respond in the way one would want them to and now we see the consequences. Sometimes the impression is conveyed that Ireland has a foot and mouth problem because we took vigorous effective action when others did not.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the farming community has had a major change of experience since we joined the European Community. Before we joined the <Col N="606" /> Community we had to subsidise our exports to the British market. How many times did we find our emigrants returning to tell us they could get Irish produce a lot cheaper in Liverpool or Birmingham? They thought that was a tribute to England. The reason it was cheaper in England was that before we joined the European Community our taxpayers had to subsidise our produce in England in order to keep some niche in the market against New Zealand, Danish and Australian produce in relation to which some countries had very privileged arrangements. That cannot be forgotten, whatever reservations we might have about the Common Agricultural Policy and its operation.</P>
    <P>I was the Minister for Agriculture who negotiated 100% premium payments from Brussels in respect of all sheep, ewe, beef or other premia on the basis that if we had to match what they were paying by 30% contributions it would bring impossible inflationary pressures on us. That was agreed. Despite discrepancies and unnecessary technicalities and regulations in premia payment the fact is that the payments are fully funded by our European partners and they have been of considerable benefit to us.</P>
    <P>It is a privilege and obligation to make this contribution and I hope that we will have opportunities over the next few years to make similar contributions on the evolution of Europe. We have shamefully wasted parliamentary time on personalities and issues that allow the lads in the gallery to have a headline instead of engaging in important issues such as this. That is not real politics.</P>

      <P>I welcome yet another opportunity for the Irish people to vote through referendum on a European issue. Since 1972 there have been many opportunities where they, uniquely in this instance, have an opportunity through referenda to vote for the evolution and developments that must be enshrined in our Constitution through the Treaty of Accession, the Single European Act, the Treaty of Maastricht, Amsterdam and now the Treaty of Nice. It is an opportunity for the people to grasp enthusiastically what we are trying to achieve in the Treaty of Nice. The people will vote in favour of the Treaty of Nice if they reflect on the important issues in the treaty and reflect on how the evolution of Europe through the various treaties over the years has been of benefit to the people and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, mentioned some of the figures in relation to developments in the EU and what they have meant to the Irish. The most important development for us is the confidence it has given our country in the family of nations of the European <Col N="607" /> Union. It is important that we approve the Treaty of Nice. What we are trying to achieve through the referendum is to allow other applicant states become members through the process of enlargement and to streamline some of the institutional arrangements in order to make the Union less bureaucratic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the enlargement proposal enshrined in the treaty. It gives stability on the European continent through joining former eastern bloc countries with the family of nations from western Europe into a major economic bloc. It is a source of pride to existing member countries that so many applicant countries seek to join this very successful European Union. These applicant countries have gone through enormous political difficulties. They are young in terms of democratic freedom and are fledgling economies that need the support of all the member states to bring them through the initial years of membership and through the process that will arise from the ratification of this treaty to full membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>We have nothing to fear from an enlarged European Union. It is a great opportunity for the Irish economy and people to embrace countries in a similar position to the Ireland of 1972 where we had a low level of economic activity largely dependent on one industry, agriculture. Through the advances in education, and technological education and training in particular, we have one of the brightest, youngest populations in Europe ever to take its place and compete internationally in business, marketing and in various other opportunities that have opened up through our membership. The expansion in language training and in the number of languages that our young people have is a clear testimony of the European attitude to which the Irish have become accustomed. We are an outward looking people. We have always been a small open economy with an outward looking population and have great confidence and pride in our place in the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is in the Irish national interest to have a peaceful, prosperous and stable Europe. Some of these applicant countries have been involved in conflict and the fact that they are now prepared to join a stable, peaceful economic and cultural political bloc like the European Union will surely make it more difficult for atrocities to take place or political difficulties to arise. They will be part of the union and have its support. In a small open economy such as ours stability and peace must be important if we are to enhance our reputation. It enhances our international prospects of greater market share. It increases the market by 150 million to 550 million. Many Irish companies are already established in Poland and Hungary. Glanbia from my own Kilkenny constituency established a very important facility in Hungary many years ago and is enlarging that facility to establish greater market share for the agricultural produce that it produces and exports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> The ratification of Nice will enhance business employment for the Irish. I will exhort my constituents to give a yes vote to the treaty. The Fine Gael Party has always been pro-Europe and I will be exhorting my constituents to give a yes vote to the Treaty of Nice. Fine Gael is pro-Europe, but not blindly so, and the European People's Party, of which we are a member, is at the heart of European parliamentary policy. A vote for peace and stability, Fine Gael believes, is in the best interests of the development of the European Union.</P>
    <P>We are a young country with well trained young people, who can compete with anyone on the European stage, and we have the confidence as a nation to go forward and compete with the countries emerging in the EU. Our economy will get an unprecedented opportunity to show that we can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best in the EU. I wholeheartedly welcome the new economies and countries that will be part of the Union.</P>

        <b>:</b> It is outrageous that the Bill for a referendum over the Nice Treaty is being rushed through the Dáil as it is, not allowing for a proper discussion, and rushed through to a referendum, probably on 7 June, without allowing for a proper debate by the people. I am not convinced by Fianna Fáil Members who complain about a lack of time but were not there this morning to vote for more time when I protested about the short length available today.</P>
      <P>I will talk about what the heart of the Nice Treaty is and is not about. It is not about uplifting the working people, the poor people and the small farming community of Eastern Europe. They need uplifting after emerging from the dark years of the Stalinist dictatorships. The real agenda behind Nice is not the welfare of the majority of the central and eastern peoples but the creation of a massive economic bloc incorporating 500 million people within which the most powerful multi-national corporations can substantially increase their reach into central and eastern Europe, further massively increasing their profits. It is also the creation of a military wing for this bloc which can rival other trading blocs in the economic sphere and carry as much military weight as the United States in particular, which is both the EU's trading partner and serious rival.</P>
      <P>Fronted by EU governments and politicians, such as the Fine Gael and Labour parties, the process of enlargement and militarisation is driven, not by concern for the working people or poor of central and eastern Europe, as is claimed, but by the greed of corporate entities which contain in their ranks the major producers of mass destruction and the purveyors of misery and death throughout the world; the armaments conglomerates of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The think tanks and unofficial organisations, encompassing the biggest corporations in the EU <Col N="609" /> exert decisive influence over its direction. Unelected and faceless to the EU peoples, big businesses' representatives dictate to governments as a matter of course. The European Round Table, which comprises leading industrialists, chairmen and chief executives of European multi-national companies, with membership by invitation only, is such a body. The combined turnover of the European Round Table companies in 1999 was stg£740 billion, employing millions. They carry huge weight. Their members in 1999 represented the most powerful corporations in the EU, for example, Imperial Chemical Industries from the United Kingdom, Royal Dutch Shell, BP Amoco, the Swiss Nestlé and Hoffman La Roche, as well as household names from other countries, like Carlsberg, Unilever, Siemens, Fiat and Pirelli. These corporations deploy their power and resources to lobby, push or bully EU governments as appropriate, which oblige. They also lavishly fund many political parties pushing for the Nice Treaty and all it entails.</P>
    <P>That is not to speak about the murky world of corruption involving some major companies which emerged recently. Architects of EU enlargement, such as Herr Kohl and the German Christian Democrats, were funded corruptly by multi-national corporations which stand to gain massively from EU enlargement and the Nice Treaty. Bodies, like the European Round Table, push enlargement into central and eastern Europe, not to increase the well-being and happiness of these countries' peoples but to extend their markets and have a ready supply of low paid labour.</P>
    <P>They are already heavily involved in these parts of Europe. Many have subsidiaries there, as have Irish based multinationals, such as one of our big banks and Jefferson Smurfit &ndash; Mr. Smurfit belongs to the European Round Table. They want to link with the elite of these countries who are enthusiastic about EU membership since they stand to gain hugely at the expense of their peoples. These elites are composed of former Stalinist <i>apparatchiks</i>, who presided over the totalitarian regimes which oppressed their peoples and brought their economies to their knees. They used the privatisation of industry to rob the states' assets from the people to whom they rightly belong. By linking up with the corporations in the EU, they will become wealthy beyond their dreams. Those in the Dáil, who denounced hypocritically the oppressors of these peoples in the Stalinist era, are prepared to do business with these same people, who have changed their clothes but not in exploiting the own people.</P>

        <b>:</b> What of the ordinary people, the poor and small farming communities? Poland's two million farmers, handed over to the tender mercies of the capitalist market <Col N="610" /> in the enlarged EU, will be decimated. These countries are joining against a different background from that which obtained when Ireland did. The international economy will be uncertain. The cold winds of recession, beginning in the United States, signal the reassertion of the iron laws of capitalist development which ensure that bust, unfortunately, is as much a factor as boom. Recession, and even slump, appear and reappear as indebtedness, overproduction and other ills of the capitalist economy take their toll.</P>
      <P>Bringing in the eastern European countries is tied up with the deregulation and privatisation, driven within the EU for several years by major corporations. Existing public services will be ruthlessly privatised and taken over by the EU conglomerates. Language is a major casualty of the EU, as it has been of recent war efforts, when things are not put in their real terms. For example, enhanced co-operation is, in reality, code for an inside track, an elite within the 15 current members of the EU who wish, or may wish at a certain stage, to leave behind weaker currencies, and it is a delusion for weaker countries, such as Portugal, and even this State, to believe that in the coming world recession, which is inevitable in the next years, they will be able to keep up with some of the major powers within Europe. They will be left behind, and even the euro currency itself, if implemented next year, will come under pressure, to say the least.</P>
      <P>The Nice Treaty advances and consolidates the Common Foreign and Security Policy already embraced by the European Union. With the debasement of language, that is a weapon in the hands of the EU. The Common Foreign and Security Policy is said to be about peace and love, but it is about giving military muscle to the EU's economic weight to ensure that it has that military muscle to back up its economic power. We are indignantly told that there is no EU army in store, yet we have a Rapid Reaction Force of 60,000 which will involve a cohort of about 200,000 from which to draw, 400 combat planes, 100 warships. What would one call this? If an object looks like an elephant, walks like an elephant, feels like an elephant, in my book it certainly is an elephant. However, judging by what it has said so far in relation to the Rapid Reaction Force, our Government would say that the elephant is a turtle dove, and not only that but that it has an olive branch in its mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is driving the militarisation of the EU? Let the facts speak for themselves. EU countries account for 36% of total arms sales by OECD countries. Of the 100 largest arms producing companies in the world, 39 belong to EU countries. I could list them, but I do not have the time. On a rough calculation, arms sales in 1998 by these EU-based companies were US$55 billion, with profits of US$13 billion. All that is envisaged in the Common Foreign and Security Policy is grist to the profit mills of these multinational armaments corporations. What does the advancement of peace have to do with the facilitation of these <Col N="611" /> companies who engage in the dirtiest and most repulsive trade known to humanity? </P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Nice Treaty and will call for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, but not as a nationalist; the Socialist Party is an internationalist movement. It is linked with the Committee for a Workers' International which organises in virtually all the countries of the EU and some of the countries who are now becoming candidates for the EU. We are opposed to it on the basis of genuine internationalism, on the basis of the alternative that should be and could be built to the dominance of the greed of the multinationals, on the basis of the principles of democratic socialism and genuine internationalism. A Europe genuinely of the peoples of Europe and for the peoples of Europe could be established where we could use and exchange and develop resources, not driven by the predatory actions of the multinationals but in the interests of ordinary people and in consonance with protection of the environment and our ecosystems. It would be a Europe where the swords would be beaten into ploughshares&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
      <P>The basic role of the European Union was to unite Europe after years of division. In 1973, when we first joined, it was known as the European Community or Common Market, and Ireland was one of the poorest members. The European Community did not turn its back on us then, just as we cannot turn our back on new entrants such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic which are poorer than we were then.</P>
      <P>Ireland is the only member state that must have a referendum on this treaty. It is essential that the people of Ireland realise that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote for the Nice Treaty is a vote for prosperity and progress, not only for the applicant countries but also for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 15 members of the European Union currently have a population of 370 million. As a member of the Single European Market, Ireland pays no taxes or hidden charges on exports to the other 14 member states. Since we export 85% of our produce, we benefit enormously from the Single Market. When enlargement is completed, <Col N="612" /> our exports will have access to a Single Market of around 550 million. This is of enormous importance to an open trading economy like ours. Irish exports centred on European countries who are applying now have risen by well over 300% in the past five years. Enlargement will increase this trade, strengthen our economy and provide much-needed jobs in our community.</P>
    <P>Ireland is an attractive location for foreign direct investment, partly because of its ability to export directly into the Single Market. This can only be enhanced by the increase in the Single Market which will result from enlargement. Joining the European Union in 1973, a major objective was to attract foreign investors and foreign industry to provide much needed jobs. Now, for the first time in a long time, this country has jobs at home. Young people are staying in Ireland. They are setting up home here and living here and we are no longer, as some cartoonists put it at times, exporting our children along with our cattle. We have jobs for them and we must thank the Single Market and the European Union for that.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is good for Ireland. Those who disagree trot out the same arguments and scaremongering tactics. Debate on the treaty should be based on fact and not rehearsed revisions of old and not-so-reliable unfounded arguments. Sinn Féin and the Green Party have opposed every development of the European Union since the 1970s. Once again, they have not failed in formulating sometimes ridiculous arguments against the EU and the treaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland's interests will be protected by the Nice Treaty. The treaty is about reforming the institutions for a larger 27 member EU so that it can operate effectively. It is not about creating a two-tier super state. We will maintain our voice in the European Commission. Ireland, like all other members, will have one Commissioner after 2005. After enlargement has taken place, the rotation system will ensure that Ireland will be represented no differently from the larger member states. We will maintain our voice in the European Parliament. Ireland has been allocated 12 seats in the Parliament. We will continue to have a better ratio of seats to population than any existing member state except Luxembourg &ndash; twice our entitlement on a population basis. We will maintain our voice on the Council of Ministers. With fewer than 1% of the population, we will have over 2% of the votes on the Council. This means that we will continue to have a voting weight more than twice our entitlement on the basis of population.</P>
    <P>The Nice Treaty does not affect our neutrality, and despite the ridiculous claims with which the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign has tried to unnerve and scare the electorate, Ireland will retain its neutrality. There will be no European army. Irish soldiers will participate only in peace-keeping operations backed by the UN and Dáil Éireann. The neutrality threat card has always been a favourite scare tactic of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> It did not work in 1992 when we voted on the Maastricht Treaty or in 1998 when we voted on the Amsterdam Treaty. It will not work this June because the electorate can see we have not lost our neutrality in the EU so far and there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that we will lose it in the future. The &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign claim that the Nice Treaty will affect Irish neutrality is once again without basis and simply not true.</P>
    <P>The treaty does not take away any of our rights to set our own taxes. Nothing in the Treaty of Nice will alter this Government's ability to continue our policy of low taxes for business and workers. It is clearly stated in the Nice Treaty that Ireland will retain this area of taxation. Any suggestion that we are losing democratic control over fiscal policy is clearly without any basis whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The European Union has been very good for Ireland and the electorate knows this. Since 1973 it has continued to endorse various stages in the development of the EU through the referendum process. Many of the applicant countries will look towards Ireland when planning their future in the EU. It is undeniable that the EU has played a role in Ireland's outstanding economic success over the past decade and will continue to do so in the future. Enlargement means new markets for Irish food producers and exporters. It is also important to point out that direct grants to Irish farmers will continue and the Common Agricultural Policy will continue to play a crucial role in transforming living standards in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The EU has played a large role in improving living standards for everyone in Ireland. Europe provided the framework for the introduction of the minimum wage. European legislation ensured equal pay for men and women workers. The European Social Fund plays an important role in the elimination of unemployment through the national development plan. The EU has also made a large contribution to the peace process in Ireland through the EU Peace Programme and through the International Fund for Ireland. We have gained from EU membership and we must now ensure that other countries get their chance to do the same.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote for the Nice Treaty is a vote for continued Irish success and prosperity in the EU. It is also a vote to share this success with countries which are less fortunate than we are. The Nice Treaty poses no threat whatsoever to Ireland's position in the European Union &ndash; on the contrary, we can only continue to prosper in a larger Union. Any claims made by the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign which state otherwise have been proved wrong in the past and will be proved wrong in the future. The Nice Treaty simply prepares the Union for enlargement through institutional reform so that millions more Europeans can enjoy its benefits. It is about sharing the Europe of the future for the benefit of Ireland and all Europeans.</P>
    <P>I would like to nail on the head something that was said earlier about signing up to the Nice <Col N="614" /> Treaty, living standards in rural Ireland and the applicant countries. There is no comparison in regard to living standards in rural Ireland today with those in the early 1970s. I have no doubt that the countries which will be joining over the coming years will benefit enormously both the rural and urban sectors.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil have in their outlook and ethos a genuine internationalist outlook which makes them, in effect, real parties of Government, parties that can participate in Government because they are mainstream and prepared to accept the international norms and the necessity of going with large and progressive projects such as the European Union.</P>
      <P>I have been following the public statements and positions adopted by the opponents of the treaty with some considerable interest. The so-called Peace and Neutrality Alliance of Sinn Féin, the Greens, the Socialist Party and assorted others are an unholy and unwholesome modern alliance which has cobbled together a cranks' charter of objections to the treaty. They are completely out of touch with the deep veins of Irish republican and social thinking which are, at best, both internationalist and pluralist in their impulse. Wolfe Tone, James Connolly, Thomas Davis, even the Fenian dynamite men of the 1860s or O'Donovan Rossa would have little time for the narrow republicanism and the narrow socialism and negative tactics being adopted by those who claim to be the great inheritors of Tone and Connolly. It is important that is pointed out because everybody in this House has a republican root, even Deputy Gilmore coming as he does from the Workers' Party tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As parties we all have republicanism in our veins and none of us have exclusive rights to that particular ideology. It is an ideology shared across all the parties; it is the great foundation root of our political system. It is time that people with those particular views and a highly developed sense of republicanism emphasised their republicanism in the context of a new and developing Europe and that they do so in a way that ensures <Col N="615" /> that parties like the Greens and Sinn Féin in its current form do not claim monopoly rights over those ideas and that kind of thinking.</P>
    <P>Those who cannot shake off the sectarian mindsets developed in the Six Counties have transmuted Anglophobia into Europhobia and downright xenophobia on this issue of European developments in relation to the Nice Treaty. True republicanism entails more than a simplistic commitment to a narrow historical struggle. Those opposing the treaty are sadly lacking any internationalist vision and were they to have their way they would reduce this country to the status of being peopled with &ldquo;little Irelanders&rdquo;. I use the words &ldquo;little Irelanders&rdquo; advisedly. We have come a long way as a small country on the edges of the European Continent. We have come a great distance but we are no longer a nice little country or a small country. We are a very significant and wealthy country and with that wealth, we are ready to participate in the great international projects unfolding on the European Continent. We must play our part and to shy or run away from that would be downright immoral and wrong.</P>
    <P>In recent years when we did not have money, we did not make the contribution we should have been making. We are still not making the contribution in relation to international aid, but this Government is committed to lifting that contribution, as I am sure Members opposite are, to match our wealth with the new responsibility that goes with it.</P>
    <P>I suspect the opponents of Nice do not have the courage of their convictions to come out and say unequivocally that they are outright opponents of our membership of the European Union but, with weasel words, would have us adopt an <i>à la carte </i>approach to it. They want the benefits of membership without the burdens. They have no credible alternative to propose and their paranoid talk of conspiracies and hidden agendas serves only to reinforce their own faith in their self-contained and circular philosophies. The Greens, in particular, are coming from an extreme position compared even to their colleagues in the German Government whose balanced advocacy of the treaty shows what constructive Green policies can be like when they have the courage of their convictions and come into Government. It is a sad reflection on the state of development of the Green Party in this country that it still seems oblivious to the diktats, the demands and responsibilities that go with becoming a party that may be in Government. I know in recent times Deputy Gormley, obviously seething with a certain ambition, has indicated that they may be bankable and that it may be possible that they may become a partner in some coalition Government of the future. If they are going to do that, they will have to prepare the way and enter the real world.</P>
    <P>I always think a great sign of a party moving away from the extremes, into the mainstream and <Col N="616" /> the centre ground of politics is its attitude to Europe. It is no coincidence I suppose that in 1992 Sinn Féin at its conference in Ballyfermot, which I was privileged to attend as a journalist, finally acknowledged the reality of the European Union and, more or less, accepted its existence. I suppose the Greens and Sinn Féin still have a long way to go in that regard.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin refuses to admit that membership of the then EEC in 1973 entailed a fundamental cession of sovereignty. What they are proposing logically leads to secession from the Union but they lack the guts to say it. One cannot have it both ways by arguing against the EU and then trying to maximise the benefits.</P>
    <P>Europe has never been a divisive issue here. We are mercifully free of the Euro scepticism and related strife so rampant in our nearest neighbour for decades. Ireland does not need that type of division or self-deluding or half-hearted membership and those promoting it are to be opposed and condemned.</P>
    <P>EU membership has enabled us not only to diversify our trade and cultural contacts, but to develop a growing self-confidence and identity as a truly independent Republic and as a truly committed participant in this great European project. Membership has enabled us to shed the cultural cringe that held us back for so long but which still informs in a warped way the mind-sets of those such as Sinn Féin who oppose the treaty and who would prevent us playing our full part in this community of nations.</P>
    <P>In recent days I notice Mr. Schröder has published his own vision and proposal for the future development of the EU. Some international commentators and others are saying this was slightly unwelcome in the context of Governments such as ours trying to advocate a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, that he was somehow fast tracking the discussion regarding the future. I disagree and think the German Chancellor was correct to put these things on the table and open discussion about the future and how we will develop the political and, if necessary, military capability to defend a large economic bloc.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is particularly expert in suggesting there is some sinister plan to create a European army. I am one of the minority in my party, but perhaps not in such a minority in the House, who agrees with the idea of a European army. Unfortunately, the reality is that it is not contained in this treaty. Therefore, there are not any implications for our neutrality in this treaty. I would prefer if we were full participants in European defence structures, including a European army if such was to develop. It is important we realise our international responsibilities. It is also important when we look at currency strengthening and the settling down which will occur when the currency is finally accepted and freely in circulation that we look at political and military issues in terms of how we defend the Union. It would be scandalous and wrong to leave such a large, powerful, strong and influen<Col N="617" /> tial economic bloc open and defenceless against people such as Milosevic.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to see the opposition to this project from the hard left. In effect Deputy Joe Higgins opposes the admittance of new countries such as the Czech Republic to this great Union and would deny them the benefits we have enjoyed. This smacks of hypocrisy and immorality. I had the privilege of working in the Czech Republic in 1992 when it was opening up, and the reality is that these people are hungry for the same things we have attained. In time they will achieve the same wealth and success we have achieved through membership of the EU and through our own efforts. It would be shameful for us, even on the basis that agricultural subsidies were drying up, to deny those people the same right. New members open the possibility of further trade. We have everything to gain. The Germans gained a great deal from the EU. Although they are often presented as being benign, positive and sharing their money, in fact German industry gained a great deal from open access to the markets of Europe.</P>
    <P>As a member of Fianna Fáil I find the misunderstanding both inside and outside the House of de Valera's position on neutrality both bizarre and worrying. De Valera was not neutral in the classic sense of the word. Neutrality only arose as a result of the failure of one of the great internationalist projects, namely, the League of Nations, under the jackboot of fascism in the 1930s. It was only for that reason that he opted progressively for a position of neutrality. It was also clearly as a result of the unresolved problem of the Border with Northern Ireland, and our relationship with Britain. De Valera was an internationalist and not a narrow ideological supporter of neutrality. He was an idealistic person, as I suspect are some of the people opposite who believe there is a responsibility in terms of internationalist action at various stages to defend human rights and to defend people from the kind of genocide we saw in the Second World War.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Gerry Reynolds and Ulick Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Conor Lenihan, I was in the House when Deputy Joe Higgins spoke. I agree with some of the comments and observations made by Deputy Higgins. As a socialist I share his opposition to international capitalism and the exploitation it brings for many in the world. I also share his disdain for the arms race and its promulgation. However, the consequence of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would not be the picture painted by Deputy Higgins, namely, what he described as a genuine European Community rising like a phoenix, with swords beaten into ploughshares and the ending of exploitation. Rather the consequence of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote will be that the 12 applicant countries will continue to be excluded from membership for an even longer period and will continue to be exposed, without the protection of the collective framework of EU laws, to the very exploitation <Col N="618" /> by international capital about which Deputy Higgins spoke. They will continue to be the source of cheap labour and cheap and easy markets. In some cases, in the context of regional or area conflicts, they may also be victims of the arms trade.</P>
    <P>It is a pity this debate and the run in to the referendum will be very short. What we need is not a debate along the old style European referendum debates to which we are accustomed with, on the one hand, people talking about great prosperity and the benefit to farmers, businesses and others and on the other hand saying we will all be dragooned into a European army. We need a serious debate about our concept of the future of Europe and the place of Europe in the wider world. The Government is making a very serious mistake in rushing the referendum on the Nice Treaty, which does not have to be ratified until the end of 2002. We would have a much more rational and mature debate about Europe, our place in it and Europe's place in the rest of the world if the debate took place over a longer period.</P>
    <P>The shortened, truncated debate allowed for will facilitate the type of sloganeering which has characterised many of the debates we have had about Europe. That is why the proposal made by the leader of my party for a forum on the future of Europe which would involve debate and discussion, not just among political parties but among the wider interest groups, should be taken up by the Government. I have a view on Europe which arises from the fact that if one looks at what is happening in relation to decision making support for this view can be found in many areas. For example, in the course of the referendum campaign much concern will be expressed about the removal of decision making from this country. Decisions affecting the public are not being made in this Parliament or by the Government but elsewhere. That has been happening for a long time, not only with regard to political institutions but in the way in which economics and communications have become globalised.</P>
    <P>In recent days the frustrations of many young people with globalisation have been expressed in cities worldwide but the answer to globalisation and the evolution of global capitalism is not to throw stones through the windows of McDonalds' restaurants but to put in place global and regional political institutions that are capable of ensuring that the democratic will of the people predominate rather than the will of the market operating of its own volition. That is why it is important to construct a wide European Union involving all of the countries and peoples of Europe who wish to participate in it. An additional 12 European states wish to participate in the EU of which we are members. This referendum on the Nice Treaty will decide whether they are facilitated with membership.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the treaty that are not entirely satisfactory and the Labour Party has criticised some of them. We would all wish the Taoiseach and the Government had returned <Col N="619" /> from Nice with a better treaty. The core political decision to be made in this referendum is concerned with the enlargement of the European Union and whether this country will delay or assent to the accession by the 12 applicant states whose peoples want to become members.</P>
    <P>If the EU is to be enlarged it has implications for the size of the number of MEPs we send to Strasbourg, the European Commission, the way in which the Council of Ministers does its business and the way in which institutions are established in the Union. The Labour Party will urge a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum. We again appeal to the Government not to rush it but to take up our proposal to establish a forum on the future of Europe and to have a longer and more balanced debate on this issue over a prolonged period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time. This has been an interesting debate. I was present for part of Deputy Joe Higgins' speech. A number of Deputies have said the issues he raises reflect concerns by the public. However, the view of those opposed to the treaty is misleading and not thought through.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore's comments and with the proposal by his party leader for an open debate on the future development of Europe. I am not sure if this referendum will be passed by the majority of the people if they are asked to vote on 7 June. There is a fear and misunderstanding about what is involved and according to my information those who are calling for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote are winning the public debate because of this. The Government should take this into consideration.</P>
      <P>There is no need to hold this referendum on 7 June but if it is held I and my party will support it. The views advocated by the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign are being widely discussed among the public. There are fears about the establishment of a European army and the possibility that the country may lose powers over decision making within Europe. There is also a fear of the idea of a federal Europe.</P>
      <P>The Government must lead in this debate with the support of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party. Much work remains to be done with little time at our disposal. Much greater information must be made available to the public to the effect that this is the best way to proceed with the development of the country. I support a federal Europe. We have moved significantly towards federalism. Economic and monetary union is one aspect.</P>
      <P>I also support the Fine Gael policy in favour of a European army. We cannot expect to derive the economic and social benefits of membership of the EU without being called upon to defend the Union if necessary. My colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party should express their support for a European army. They should not sit on the fence on the issue of neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Neutrality is not an issue in this treaty but it is a cause of concern among the public. It must be addressed. The wrong approach is to say it is not an aspect of the treaty because it will arise later when it can then be discussed. If we are to be members of a federal economic and social Europe we must support the concept of a European army. We must be able and willing to defend the Union.</P>
    <P>The 12 applicant states should be accepted. That is why I have great difficulty accepting the bona fides of Deputy Joe Higgins, Sinn Féin and the Green Party who claim they represent the underprivileged. The applicant states are struggling. Many of them were under communist rule for many years and are new democracies. They need social and economic development. Our evolution in the Union is an important example for the applicant states of what can be achieved.</P>
    <P>We could take a narrow focus and concentrate on the benefits that would accrue to this country if the applicant states became members. Their accession will create a larger market which this country needs. We are one of the largest exporters of hi-tech software in the world and our exports to this expanded market will create more jobs in the high value added industries. That positive aspect must be sold.</P>
    <P>This country has a very strong role to play in the development and evolution of a larger Europe. We should ensure that this message is sold to the public. People are unsure if this is the right way to proceed because of the absence of proper debate and information. I am not sure if we can provide enough information to the public within the next six to eight weeks. It is very important we do so.</P>
    <P>We will be lucky if the turnout for the vote on the referendum is greater than 30% and we will be lucky to win the referendum. However, such a turnout means that 70% of the public will not have participated in deciding a very important issue that will affect the lives of this and future generations. A &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote will have a huge and negative impact on the enlargement process and the movement towards a federal Europe and will have implication in terms of a loss for this country in the decision making process.</P>
    <P>We must be careful. We have a lot of selling to do and the Government should be aware of that. I hope it will take into consideration the views expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the idea of the Treaty of Nice as an important milestone in the development of a new, expanded Europe. There is an onus on everyone here to display a commitment to Europe, to be generous towards the principles of the European Union and to show the applicant states the benefits we have obtained from membership of the EU. We can often forget the fact that in 1973, when we applied to and became a member state of the EU, we were a poor country. We were crippled with borrowings and damned by emigration. We must take that picture of <Col N="621" /> Ireland and place it against what we now are. Ireland is now a prosperous, modern, forward-looking country. We must acknowledge that it was our membership of the European Community which brought this change about.</P>
      <P>We have heard many passionate expressions of support for each side of the debate during the past few days. The reality is that outside this House the same passion is not evident among the electorate. The onus is on the Government to liven up the debate and involve the people outside. It is no use saying that the people who are opposed to the Treaty of Nice are the eurosceptics and we do not have to take their views into account. I reject that. The opponents of the treaty are entitled to the expression of their views and they should not be dismissed by us. They may have legitimate fears.</P>
      <P>Eurosceptics can be found on the Government side. Minister Síle de Valera has on occasions joined that bandwagon when she expressed serious concerns about the direction in which Europe is leading us. She did not express those views in this House but rather across the Atlantic. Minister Cowen may well remember that because it was not too long ago.</P>
      <P>European legislation over the years has affected and influenced Ireland. Much of that legislation has had serious detrimental effects on the quality of life and the future viability of farming families in the west. I hope these issues will be addressed in the future. It is important that some of those EU directives, which we are bound by, would be examined.</P>
      <P>Many people think that we are heading into a two-tier Europe. I know that Minister Cowen has rejected that opinion out of hand. However, when we examine the detail it seems that we will have reduced representation in the European Parliament as a result of this proposal. In 2005, we will lose our right to a permanent Commissioner and we will have a Commissioner on a rotational basis like everyone else. That will be a disadvantage to this country in the future. It is very important and necessary to have permanent representation at Commission level in order to protect our national interests.</P>
      <P>One can see the benefits that the EU has brought to Ireland. We acknowledge the benefits of infrastructure and services that we would never have had without being a member state of the EU. We must explain to the electorate that we are all beneficiaries of EU membership.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in relation to the constitutional referendum on the Nice Treaty. Many speakers have been here today because the time is short and the importance of this amendment must be <Col N="622" /> explained. There is a difficulty in getting the message to the electorate as to the importance of the Nice Treaty. I spoke to some people today and told them that I would be speaking in the House. I asked them if they had any views on the treaty, but, by and large, they knew very little about it. That worries me because the turnout for the referendum could be affected. The opponents to the treaty will make the effort to vote but I am worried that other people will not bother.</P>
      <P>I am certain that the majority of people in this country are supportive of the amendment relating to the Treaty of Nice, but I am afraid that many people will sit at home and expect others to go out and vote. I urge everyone to support the constitutional amendment. Lack of support in Ireland for the Treaty of Nice would show us to be greedy. We have been beneficiaries of membership of the EU since 1973. At that time, the average Irish income was two thirds of the European norm. We are now nudging ahead of the European average. That is due to our membership of the EU.</P>
      <P>Germany has been regarded as the main paymaster for Europe. We have benefited from the likes of Germany and other countries being net contributors to Europe. Are we now to turn around and say that we have what we want and have no sympathy for anyone else? That would be very wrong. I believe that while we are still net beneficiaries, we will soon be net contributors. We must play our part and provide funding to lift up other countries to the level we have achieved.</P>
      <P>When we became a member of the European Community nearly 30 years ago, Russia was anathema to everything we believed in. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once part of the USSR, now want to join the EU. I hope that we will be prepared to play our part in ensuring that they and other countries will have the opportunity to become members in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome this timely debate and I reject the criticism by some parties that the referendum should be delayed to allow for further debate. I believe we need a nice, sharp and concise debate to stimulate passion and thought. We need again to invoke a belief in the electorate that Europe is good for Ireland and good for Europe. As we look at the positive aspects of the Nice Treaty negotiated very successfully by this Government and in particular by the Minister present, we must address the underlying factors as to why we are moving forward with enlargement in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years we benefited very much from being involved in Europe. It is now time to look forward and embrace other nations who are looking to Europe for economic, social and legal stability. They need to be given a sense of purpose within a new Europe. We do not have to go back too far to remember the dark days of the Second World War and the misery it visited on the people <Col N="623" /> of Europe. The Irish people also suffered at that time. It is now time for Ireland to stand up and support this treaty in an overwhelming manner and ensure that we send out a strong message to those who would undermine the EU, both from within and outside the European Union. It is timely for those who oppose the treaty to explain exactly their reasons for doing do. Parliamentarians from the applicant countries will outline rapidly their support for the measures in the Nice Treaty and they are anxiously waiting to enter an enlarged Europe. It is wrong of various groups, the small parties and other outside interests to try to undermine support for an enlarged Europe. Some Members said capitalism undermines the structures of Europe. The fact of the matter is that the countries which suffer most from international capitalism are the applicant countries, the countries that do not have the protection of a large European market, access to the markets and the economic security that that affords. They should point out exactly the reasons for opposing it.</P>
    <P>Another issue that will have to be addressed as we approach referenda in the future is the McKenna judgment. I genuinely believe it undermines the parliament, it stifles political debate and undermines the basic tenet of democracy which elects a Government. It should be in a position to support, with public funds, referenda recommended to the Irish people. It is disingenuous to say the Government is not supporting this measure when it has one arm tied behind its back because of the McKenna judgment. This judgment must be visited because-&mdash;</P>

      <P>A little knowledge of mathematics and common sense would indicate that one would have to support the Nice Treaty. It makes good economic sense for Ireland. One has to look at the experience of the past and ask oneself how Ireland has grown. We have demonstrated since joining the EU that we are capable of adapting and taking advantage of the benefits and the opportunities which full participation of the Union has offered. How can anyone say that having the market increased to 500 million people would disadvantage Ireland in any way, or inhibit our agricultural produce and our high tech projects in those emerging markets? The Irish people have consistently rejected those who have argued for an inward introverted vision based on a lack of confidence in the capacity of the Irish to advance their interests successfully in the European movement. Ireland is a model for many of those countries seeking accession. It is a country where membership of the Union has been seen <Col N="624" /> to be invaluable in promoting economic growth, employment and social development.</P>
      <P>When we joined the EU, the GDP average was 60.7%, now the European average is 113.9%. While economic growth was the result of many factors, we have benefited from Structural and Cohesion Funds. Membership of the euro has also brought benefits. The convergence criteria, carefully laid down at Maastricht, ensured that all the participating states kept deficits, inflation and interest rates tightly controlled. Given that farming in Ireland and abroad is facing one of its toughest tests, how could any farmer say in general that he has a guaranteed market for 90% of all consumer products? Membership of the EU has provided less tangible but nonetheless significant benefits. On the one hand we have been able to break out of a pattern of excessive economic dependence on our nearest neighbour and we have a choice in a far wider setting and on the other, as a member of a powerful international association, we have a chance to influence global developments, whether on the environment, co-operation with developing countries or the promotion of human rights. Enlargement will extend these benefits to a new group of members while offering opportunities to the current membership.</P>
      <P>I am confident the Irish people want to help the new countries emerging and who can look to Ireland as a model and see what it has achieved. The people will not turn their backs on these candidates as they emerge. Generally speaking, as a nation we are regarded as generous and outward looking. We want the countries of central and eastern Europe to have the same opportunities that were given to us. This makes good sense for Europe but it also makes good sense for Ireland.</P>

Approximately 40 Members have contributed to the debate, probably as many as I have heard speak on any debate here in the past six months.

      <Col N="625" /> They clearly recognise that voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to ratification is of immense importance to Ireland, to our European partners, and, in particular, to those countries preparing to join the Union. To those who oppose the treaty, what is the alternative? Do they want enlargement to go ahead? Do the opponents of the treaty believe that those countries which have been patiently rebuilding their economies and embedding democratic structures for over a decade should now be asked to wait even longer to take their rightful place at the European table? I ask that those opponents of the treaty who claim to speak for the applicants listen to the democratically elected governments of eastern and central Europe. I noticed that many Members, some inside this House and some outside, were quick to listen to them when under the Soviet influence about their position but there seems to be an inconsistency in not being able to listen to democratically elected voices in emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can intervene on Committee Stage when he can speak for half an hour if he wishes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley's intervention indicates some confusion on his part. He opposes the Nice Treaty but many of the reasons mentioned have little or nothing to do with the treaty in question. Some of them concern previous treaties, on which the member states and the Irish people have already pronounced, while others appear to be based on premonitions about what might happen in the future, for which no basis can be found in the Nice Treaty.</P>
      <P>Critics of the treaty talk about the so-called lack of democracy in the Union and at the same time resist the move to greater use of QMV, even where this makes sense. They want to keep the veto in areas such as the appointment of the President of the Commission when it is clearly not in the interests of Ireland or other small states that, as has happened, a single large state can veto the nominee agreed by the rest of the Union; so much for democracy, not to mention the kind of political gridlock this would bring to the taking of decisions at EU level. The call to retain the veto on articles relating to the Structural Funds shows a similarly out-of-date appreciation of our position in a situation where, in line with our economic performance, we are likely to become net contributors. Where it is in our interests, unanimity has been retained, particularly in relation to taxation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's comments on enlargement and what it means for the applicant states are, to say the least, unconvincing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently received the Foreign Minister of Hungary who emphasised his country's positive assessment of the treaty. The same is true of the Poles, the Czechs, the Cypriots and all applicants. These countries are in no doubt that the Treaty of Nice is about enlargement and reject the arguments of those who base their case on such inconsequential matters as the number of pages where the word &ldquo;enlargement&rdquo; appears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> Opponents of the treaty imply that they know better what is good for the candidate countries but do not state openly the logical inference that enlargement should not go ahead. By urging a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum that is what they espouse, that the Irish people should reject enlargement on the grounds that the applicant states do not know what is best for themselves. That kind of thinking makes one wonder about the path taken by the Green Party. We saw the dichotomy between the German Green Party's position and that of the Green Party in Ireland when the German Foreign Minister visited this week. The Treaty of Nice is of key importance for Europe and for Ireland in Europe. We have essential national interests and, like every other delegation, we ensured that these were protected in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Our position on the Commission was well known. Some Deputies attempted to suggest, with regard to the reweighting of Council votes, that there is a huge transfer of power from small to large states. Let us examine this suggestion on simple percentages. This position is based on a false reading of the treaty or, perhaps, a wilful misrepresentation of the agreement. Under the treaty, Ireland's share of the total vote will move from approximately 3% in a Union of 15 to 2% in a Union of 27. Germany's share will be reduced from 11% to 8% while it will also lose a Commissioner. The same applies to the UK, France and Italy. It is nonsensical to suggest that this represents a radical overthrow of established balances within the Union. Similarly, the requirement that any decisions taken have the support of at least 62% of the Union's population, given that the equivalent figure in the past has on occasions been over 70%, hardly marks a major shift of power, especially when there is a simultaneous requirement that all QMV votes have the support of at least a majority of states. The position of the smaller states is, therefore, fully protected.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose the treaty and complain of a lack of democracy in Europe might also consider why they oppose the extension of the co-decision procedure which gives the directly elected European Parliament an increased role in the EU's legislative process. I can also refer to the fact that Ireland, under the new allocation of seats, will have the best seat to population ratio of all existing member states in the Parliament, with the exception of the special case of Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>There were two other principal areas considered by the Intergovernmental Conference and agreed in the Treaty of Nice. These were the extension of QMV and the rules governing the use of enhanced co-operation. It is claimed in a recent publication by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; lobby that the summary of the White Paper seeks to hide the fact that decisions on the appointment of the President and Members of the Commission will be taken by QMV. I refer the lobby to paragraph 27 of the summary where this is explicitly stated. <Col N="629" /> Moreover, it is suggested that this will somehow preclude the Government from putting forward its preferred nominee. That chooses to ignore the fact that the new treaty provides in Article 214 that the list of Commissioners is to be &ldquo;drawn up in accordance with the proposals made by each member state&rdquo;. As mentioned already, QMV in this area means that a single large country, as happened in the not so distant past, will no longer be able to veto the choice of a President of the Commission supported by all other member states. Is this the right of veto which the &ldquo;No&rdquo; camp wishes to maintain?</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, we successfully resisted proposals to introduce QMV for taxation, a position supported by all sides of the House. I wish to dispel the notion that this was never in doubt or that a satisfactory outcome was assured. We faced continuous pressure throughout the negotiations on that issue. At Nice, revised proposals, including a Presidency draft which envisaged moving to QMV for corporation and other taxes within five years, were in circulation. It was thanks to the strong position taken by the Taoiseach, working with a small group of like minded countries, that this threat was averted.</P>
    <P>There have also been changes to the rules governing enhanced co-operation, a concept that already exists in the Amsterdam Treaty. Some have sought to portray these as creating a two tier Europe. Do the euro or Schengen create a two tier Europe? Of course not. As the Union enlarges it is likely that there will be other areas where closer co-operation by a group of countries makes sense. However, this will not be to the detriment of the overall coherence of the Union. On the contrary, in the negotiations we ensured that the treaty specifically states that such co-operation must be aimed at furthering the essential objectives of the Union, must only be considered as a last resort and must be open to all member states. Enhanced co-operation will not apply in the area of security and defence. These provisions pose no threat to the Union.</P>
    <P>Some have expressed concern at the change from unanimity to QMV when setting up enhanced co-operation under the First and Third Pillars. The significance of this change should not be exaggerated given the safeguards I mentioned earlier. The existing provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty have never been invoked and many member states thought they were, in effect, unworkable. The new provisions do not provide for a two tier Europe. Nobody is obliged to join an enhanced co-operation group and nobody can be excluded. However, we must accept that for many member states there are genuine fears that with such a large number of members at varying levels of development, there is a need to avoid paralysis in decision making. The Union in the future will be richer and larger but also more complex and diverse. Ireland has nothing to fear in this new situation. No member state has shown itself to be more capable of adapting to new challenges, and <Col N="630" /> benefiting from them, than Ireland over the years since its accession.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the helpful comments of other Deputies, including Deputy Quinn, on the debate on the future of Europe beyond Intergovernmental Conference 2004. The Government recognises the importance of this debate for the ongoing development of the Union and is currently examining proposals for how the debate might most usefully be structured. We will keep the House apprised of progress in this area.</P>
    <P>I have outlined on many occasions the benefits of the treaty for Ireland and for Europe. I ask those who urge the Irish people to vote against its ratification to reflect on their position. Does Ireland, the most open economy in Europe, wish to be isolated from the European mainstream? Do we wish to frustrate the legitimate ambitions of applicant countries to consolidate their often hard won freedom? As a model for many countries of how to use membership of the Community to develop economically, do we now wish to tell others they cannot follow in our path? Have we the vision to recognise the vital importance of ensuring peace, stability and democracy throughout the continent of Europe and being engaged and contributing to that in ways which are consistent with our foreign policy tradition or are we interested in shutting up shop and saying Europe's interests are not our interests? Are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and others less deserving of membership than we were in 1973? I have no doubt that this is not the wish of the great majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by underlining the responsibility of those who recognise the importance of the treaty to argue for it and to explain what it represents. Apathy can sometimes be as difficult to overcome as active opposition. The Government has published an informative, factual White Paper on the treaty and a summary is being delivered to every household in the State. I am confident that when people understand the content of the treaty they will have no hesitation in supporting its ratification.</P>
    <P>I wish to indicate a technical drafting matter which appears on page 6 of the Bill which I request the Clerk of the Dáil to correct under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle pursuant to Standing Order 126. It is in line 19 where the reference to &ldquo;subsection 7&rdquo; should be to &ldquo;subsection 7 of this section&rdquo;. The corresponding correction should also be made on page 7 and in respect of the Irish language version. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>There are people who sincerely believe they should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; while others are clearly politically opportunistic as well. Many people said &ldquo;no&rdquo; but one cannot say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to those working families and young people in emerging democracies who want to rejoin Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have yet to meet a person outside of this House who favours the Stadium Ireland project. Public policy is about making choices. We cannot have everything we want and we have to prioritise certain goals. This is a simplistic summary but an accurate one nevertheless. The Taoiseach has outlined his priorities both in terms of spending and assigning top level staff. He has chosen Stadium Ireland above other possible priorities, such as reforming the health services or tackling the growing under-class in society. This is not my choice, nor will it be the choice of the electorate. Ireland is a great sporting country, we have many talented top-level athletes in different sports and we are passionate about supporting sport, whether it be our county, local soccer or basketball club or even a Scottish or English soccer team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this passion and the commitment of many people to sport, the Government has been poor at developing sporting facilities, from physical infrastructure to coaching skills. Given the resources available to the Government, the time <Col N="633" /> is right to invest in sport. Stadium Ireland will not give value for money as nobody will benefit from it. It will be bad for Irish sport. Ordinary people will not have access to the facilities in this white elephant. They need better local sports facilities, like swimming pools and fitness centres. My constituency will lose a very successful gym on the Drimnagh Road. The Spheres squash club has been bought by a speculator to develop as a new private health facility which most people in my constituency will not ever have the opportunity to use. Due to lack of funds, Dublin Corporation prematurely closed the swimming pool in Ballyfermot and the redevelopment has been delayed again and again.</P>
    <P>This project will not offer anything to top-level athletes, for example 14 year olds will still be exported to soccer clubs in Britain because junior clubs do not have the resources to develop their skills, which is a travesty. Countries like Norway have put together a comprehensive network of clubs to keep young players at home until their early 20s. This is better for domestic soccer, but also better for the young men concerned as it is easier for those who do not make the grade to begin a different career if they are settled at home. Such young men are much less likely to drop out of education, as currently many of them sadly fall through the education net when they are exported to English clubs.</P>
    <P>The European Commission's recent intervention in the export of young players has relevance to Ireland and the poorest African countries. Surely, we can improve sports infrastructure to end this unacceptable export of young Irish players.</P>

      <P>Out-of-town stadia do not work. In recent days Tom Humphries put the case clearly why they do not work. Supporters will be stuck in traffic jams on the M50 on the way to the stadium, which will hardly compare to the atmosphere when one walks through town to Croke Park or Lansdowne Road. Lansdowne Road is an <Col N="634" /> excellent location and we should examine if it can be redeveloped.</P>

      <P>There is quite poor use of space on the land and a bowl design would allow for more seats. At the very least, the possibility of the development of Lansdowne Road should be examined. The money that looks like being set aside for this project would be better spent on local sports facilities, on improving the accident and emergency unit in St. James's Hospital, on making occupational therapy more widely available and on providing psychological services in schools. These are small demands and people are suffering because these services are not available. We should reconsider our priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Stadium Ireland motion. I became involved in sport at an early age and got great satisfaction and enjoyment from, and had a certain amount of success in, various codes like soccer, gaelic football, hockey and cricket at a number of levels. I firmly believe young people's participation in sport is more important than ever, particularly given the counter-attractions that are available. There is a need for a national sports centre, including the best facilities for sportsmen, sportswomen and the general public. The question that needs to be addressed is where it is to be located and its size.</P>
      <P>The Football Association of Ireland acknowledged this need some years ago, arising from its legitimate need for a home of its own and embarked on the Eircom Park project. I do not wish to discuss the internal politics of the FAI, particularly the affairs of its former chief executive, Bernard O'Byrne, except to say he had the vision and initiative to pursue the project. The major difficulty for Mr. O'Byrne and those within the FAI in favour of the project pursuing this ambition was the fact that Eircom Park stood in the way of the Taoiseach's Stadium Ireland vision.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's project was not viable without the co-operation of the FAI and without five or six soccer internationals per year. Eircom Park had to be stopped in its tracks. The Taoiseach's friends in the FAI, whether from Dublin or from Galway, undermined the project. With support from the Taoiseach's friends in the media, they combined to scuttle Eircom Park. It should be noted that the Taoiseach had prepared to send in the Minister for Defence with a scud missile to undermine the project, if necessary. It was not necessary, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of opening Croke Park, which will have a capacity of 80,000 when completed, to other codes such as soccer and rugby was a further obstacle to the Taoiseach's plans. It was well known in GAA circles that the cost of completing Croke Park was a concern which would affect the GAA's development in the towns and <Col N="635" /> villages of Ireland. The possibility of having soccer and rugby played in Croke Park, in addition to pop concerts, American football and Australian rules, was a real financial consideration in the lead up to the GAA special conference on 7 April. However, the support of two thirds of the delegates was required at that conference. Days before the conference was held the Taoiseach arrived on his white horse to intervene. He offered the GAA £60 million to complete its stadium. This donation by the Taoiseach was sufficient to enable some of the die-hards within the GAA to effectively veto the opening up of Croke Park to soccer and rugby. I personally am not opposed to the GAA securing funds or significant grants for the completion of their stadium. However, I was shocked at the manner and timing of the Taoiseach's intervention. In retrospect, I should not have been, given his objective to clear the pitch for Stadium Ireland. Eircom Park has been eliminated and now so has Croke Park, due to the Taoiseach's intervention and the veto of the delegates.</P>
    <P>The Irish Rugby Football Association had already committed itself to utilising Stadium Ireland for its international matches. There are major restrictions on the use of Lansdowne Road but there are possibilities for development which would involve a large windfall to that organisation.</P>
    <P>One of the great advantages of playing an international match at home is the atmosphere and the participation of the Irish supporters. At one stage it was said that it was worth a one goal lead to start with. As someone who, like the Minister, has travelled with the Irish soccer team over the years, I can verify the complete lack of atmosphere in a stadium which is not full. In such circumstances there is a missing dimension. A second 80,000 seat stadium is not justified financially, particularly given the crisis in the health service and the inadequacies of grant-aid to sporting organisations throughout the country. A stadium with a capacity of 50,000 or 60,000 would be more than adequate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed review. It should have taken place long ago. In that context I regret that the Minister has stated he still wants an 80,000 seat stadium. We do not need that at present. We need the facilities for our young people, our stars and our teams. Hopefully we will get those facilities and not the Taoiseach's pipedream.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, the Minister for <Col N="636" /> the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, and Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>I support the Government amendment. I agree with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, that we are a long way behind other countries, and particularly our European neighbours, in the provision of sports facilities. Old Trafford, the Nou Camp, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and the Stade de France were mentioned. When the national lottery was set up by former Minister, Deputy Donal Creed, it certainly was intended to provide sports facilities and these have been provided, but we are all aware that everybody wanted to raid the national lottery for other Government expenditure and, therefore, lottery money was spent on health projects, arts and heritage projects and the Irish language. Successive Governments have replaced Government funding in various areas with national lottery funds and this is disappointing.</P>
      <P>Stadium and Campus Ireland, from a spectator's point of view, will provide people interested in sport with an opportunity to watch international sport in comfortable surroundings. This is not the current position. One cannot provide the same level of comfort in Croke Park or Lansdowne Road. The basic comfort envisaged in Stadium Ireland is that the spectators will not get wet. Unfortunately people still get wet in parts of the new Cusack Stand in Croke Park. While people in the premier or corporate seats at Croke Park do not get wet when it rains, those seated lower down in the stand do. Similarly in Lansdowne Road this situation arises in the temporary uncovered seats known as bucket seats, which allow the FAI to increase the seated capacity there to 35,000 for a soccer international. I understand that FIFA is trying to ban the use of these bucket seats at both ends of the pitch. Certainly many people were soaked during the recent soccer game between Ireland and Andorra at Lansdowne Road because there is covered seating only on either side of the pitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Opposition stated that the wrong location was chosen for Stadium and Campus Ireland, I would ask them to look at the locations of Croke Park and Lansdowne Road. It is not satisfactory that people who travel from all parts of the country to Dublin then must find a way through the city centre to Croke Park and Lansdowne Road. If there are large numbers of spectators travelling to these stadiums, even parking can be difficult. I must admit that it was relatively easy to find parking on the occasion of the national football league final last Sunday. Much has been made of the small attendance in Croke Park that day, but it should be pointed out that there was a great deal of controversy in both Galway and Mayo that two Connacht teams had to travel to Croke Park to play a national league final. Deputy Kenny campaigned all week to have the game played in Galway, Mayo or Roscommon. While playing in Croke Park was a useful <Col N="637" /> experience for the players, it certainly did not suit the supporters.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, Deputy Kenny, who was a Minister in the previous Administration, and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, have played their part in promoting sport and in bringing major sports events, such as the Ryder Cup and stages of the Tour de France, to Ireland but, as the Minister Deputy McDaid said, the sports business is also about tourism. Conference business is important in that regard in that one needs hotels to hold conferences and these promote tourism also, but of course we also need major stadia if we are ever to stage events such as the European athletics championship, the European football championship, the Rugby World Cup finals, the Champions League or the UEFA Cup Final. How will Ireland be considered as a venue for the Olympic Games, as Deputy Gay Mitchell proposed, if we do not have a national stadium? Deputy Mitchell is a man of vision but he was sneered at and ridiculed when he proposed Dublin as a venue for the Olympic Games. The same begrudgers ridiculed Knock International Airport, describing it as a foggy boggy hill. They also ridiculed the refurbishment of Government Buildings and Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, has increased capital expenditure on sport to £83 million, which is a relatively small sum in the context of this year's expenditure on public services of £20 billion. It is, as the House will be aware, relatively easy to host the world cross-country athletic championships or find golf clubs to host the Ryder Cup, but I think we should aspire to staging other sporting events. The hosting of the Special Olympics in 2003 should give us a wake-up call. The facilities for the athletes and the host town idea must be put in place and indeed the provision of an aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown is important to that venture.</P>
    <P>Politicians have been accused of rushing to Dublin Airport to welcome home our winning teams and athletes, but I would point out that most of these successful athletes are training abroad. They are now getting some help from the Minister but in the past they had to get scholarships to train and study in the United States. After the last Olympics in Sydney there was disappointment in the media that Ireland &ldquo;achieved only one silver medal&rdquo;, through Sonia O'Sullivan, but I submit that we need a sports campus and facilities for all sports. We certainly need a 50 metre swimming pool and the Government has shown courage by appointing the first sports Minister in the history of the State and increasing sports funding to £83 million.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that people around the country are interested in providing sports facilities. There are 1,450 applications now with the Minister under the sports capital programme. That shows the great interest Irish people have in sport and I hope the Minister, the Government <Col N="638" /> and the Taoiseach will get support from the people for this project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and wholeheartedly support Sports Campus Ireland, which includes a national stadium. I am one of the many enthusiastic supporters of this project. I was delighted when the FAI came on board as its involvement will greatly enhance the status of the project. I have no doubt that with the active support of the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, Stadium and Campus Ireland will be a resounding success.</P>
      <P>Sports Campus Ireland is a people's campus. The local community, the people of Dublin and the people of Ireland deserve no less.</P>
      <P>This project falls within the category of visionary developments which have taken place in Ireland in recent decades and I commend the Minister, Deputy McDaid, for his determined efforts in moving it forward. I also commend the Taoiseach for having the vision to promote the stadium with such energy and passion. I know that he had the interests of the hundreds of thousands of sports lovers at heart when he put forward this proposal.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is no harm to cast our minds back to the time when there was not so much money around. We should remember the public appeals and the media frenzy on the urgent need for a national stadium during the Jack Charlton era when he was head of our national team during the World Cup soccer campaign. Many politicians, including Deputies Deenihan, Allen and others, were rightly to the forefront in supporting the cause. Remember Michelle Smith's Olympic swimming success. People said it was a disgrace we did not have a 50 metre swimming pool. We can have both now. The people have built up this great economy over the past ten years and they deserve Sports Campus Ireland.</P>
      <P>Croke Park cannot and never will be a national stadium, as up to 40,000 people live in the vicinity of our great Gaelic stadium. It would be unfair if they were asked to accommodate a national stadium in their front and back gardens with the associated floodlights, etc. I predict the GAA will open its doors to other sports this time next year, but that is as far as it will go. Croke Park is a GAA park, its opening up to the occasional soccer match would be an important, historic and cultural event, but we can forget about converting it into a national stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael's position on this debate is disingenuous. It is clear there are divisions within the rank and many of its members are silent.  Deputy Noonan made two serious errors in his speech last night. First, he said that the aquatic centre was added to the project without proper Cabinet approval. That is untrue. The 50 metre pool project was a subject of two Government decisions. Second, and more serious, was the Deputy's alle<Col N="639" /> gation that the Government approached the organisers of the Special Olympics regarding the use of the aquatic centre for the Special Olympics in 2003. He said the Special Olympics committee had made other arrangements to run the swimming events elsewhere. That is untrue. The international organising committee of the Special Olympics insisted on an eight lane 50 metre pool and said that if the Abbottstown pool was not available a temporary structure would have to be built and removed after the games.</P>
    <P>I attended a fund-raising function for the Special Olympics last night and am aware that the organisers are delighted with the availability of the 50 metre pool. It is a disgrace Deputy Noonan would use the Special Olympics in this way. He is trying to drag everybody down to his level of despondency.</P>
    <P>There should be no confusion between our desire to deliver a world class project and at the same time have regard to how we spend taxpayers' money. That understanding is central to the Government's approach to the development of Sports Campus Ireland. I thought the days of begrudgery were behind us, but sadly under the leadership of Deputy Noonan begrudgery and despondency are back centre stage in Irish politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I listened with interest to the debate on Sports Campus Ireland. Much of the comments I heard, as I am sure some of the Members across the floor will agree, have been completely uninformed. This is particularly true of the debate on whether we need two stadia in Dublin. It seems to be forgotten that while Croke Park is a fine stadium and will be a fantastic facility when completed, it is just for Gaelic games and up to last Easter the GAA stoutly refused to even consider making it available for soccer and rugby. In practical terms, Croke Park has its limitations. It does not have planning permission for floodlights, a basic requirement for holding international soccer and rugby games. The planning permission for Croke Park specifically restricts the number of non-GAA events in any one year to three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other argument is that two 80,000 seater stadia in Dublin are not viable. If we consider the original feasibility study commissioned, we will realise that the base case for the viability of Stadium Ireland was six major events. That does not mean the stadium has to be full for every event. The FAI has no home, despite its best efforts to get one. It has now agreed to go into Stadium Ireland. The statement made yesterday by the FAI is significant. It said the development is the most positive development for Irish sport in the history of the State. The IRFU has long recognised that Lansdowne Road is outdated and no longer has the capacity to meet the crowd requirements for rugby internationals. Up to six <Col N="640" /> rugby internationals are played here a year, which command crowds of between 50,000 and 80,000.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House is aware that 74 games a year are played in Croke Park. The GAA recognises the need to protect its asset in terms of the pitch and, on that basis, has been fully supportive of Stadium Ireland.</P>
    <P>Not only will Stadium Ireland be viable, it will be profitable. I would like to scotch the argument about Stadium Ireland being too big, with the downsizing technologies available in modern stadia, it will be possible to take the stadium size down from 80,000 to 60,000 to 40,000 without losing the intimate atmosphere that the fans want. Returning to a point Deputy Gay Mitchell made, if in the future we are to hold the Olympics, what is the point in having a 60,000 seater stadium? What short-term planning would that reflect?</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State with responsibility for sport from 1987 to 1992, one recurring question posed by people was why spend taxpayers' money on sport, why not spend it on health, education or social services? If one has a blinkered view of life, it is difficult to answer that question. There hardly seems any contest as to what the priority should be. Taking the argument to its logical conclusion, why should we spend money on the arts, parks or on the environment? </P>

That is the essence of sport and it gives just as good a return on Exchequer expenditure as any other area.</P>

      <P>The focus of Opposition criticism has been on the proposed outdoor stadium which is estimated to cost £230 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome development and it will give us an informed critical analysis, which will ensure that the project, when it proceeds, will command the support it deserves.</P>
      <P>To abandon the main thrust of the project, the 80,000 seater stadium, the 15,000 seater indoor arena, the aquatic centre and sports campus project, would be a retrograde step for which future generations would not easily forgive us.</P>
      <P>It would have been beneficial if the courage and foresight now being displayed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation was displayed in 1991. As Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I put a proposal to the GAA to allow three soccer and three rugby games per year to be played in Croke Park. The estimated cost of its proposed development at that time was £100 million and in return we proposed that £55 million would be made available by the Government and through the sale of long-term tickets by the IRFU and the FAI, but sadly that offer was rejected by the GAA. If only the GAA had the foresight then that it is beginning to display now, we would have a national stadium complete in Croke Park and the GAA would be a much stronger organisation than it is today. As a GAA man, I glad to say it is a strong organisation.</P>
      <P>In 1990 the Government got to tender stage on the provision of a 15,000 seater indoor arena and a 50 metre swimming pool on a site we purchased in the Docklands. We proposed a public private partnership and got to the point of shortlisting six consortia for a design, construct and manage tender bid. The total cost of that project to the Exchequer was only £35 million ten years ago. It was the brainchild of Noel Lindsay, the then Secretary of the Department of Education. It was a project that was ten years before its time, or perhaps 20 years before its time, if people like Deputies Noonan and Quinn get their way.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it was exactly the same arguments as those being put forward today which killed that project. Instead of engaging in political opportunism and saying &ldquo;When I am Taoiseach, I will put a stop to this project&rdquo;, Deputy Noonan should talk to the people of Limerick, who would give their right arm to attend a soccer or rugby international, or an all Ireland hurling final. They will tell him to stop making such a silly declaration.</P>

      <P>Both my party colleague, Deputy Fahey, and I share the experience of being Minister with responsibility for sport at different times, 1970-72 in my case. I wish to comment on the spurious opposition that has been presented to this project. The Fine Gael motion suggests that the funds in question would be better spent on health, education, social welfare, etc. Over many years in this House, I have heard the same objection to several other Government proposals. One such example was in 1973, when Ireland joined the European Union. The Government made quite a practical decision that we needed our own executive jet. The Opposition of the day complained about Fianna Fáil getting above themselves and having illusions, instead of looking after the old, the sick and the disabled. How can one ever defeat an argument, based on such concerns, against a Government service or a stadium? </P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point relates to the proliferation of organisations in Irish sport and recreation to an extent which differs significantly from any other country in Europe, as Deputy Allen will be aware. While I do not criticise the sporting organisations for this, towns throughout the country have a range of separate facilities but nowhere <Col N="643" /> have we got a really comprehensive facility. Instead of an integrated national approach, every organisation wants its own facility. We now need a national stadium which is up to the standard of any other country in Europe. There are examples in Stuttgart, Munich, Amsterdam and elsewhere of what we should have.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should be honest and up front with the people on this issue. They should acknowledge openly that, by scrapping the proposed national stadium, we need never expect to host any major international event. Some time ago, Deputy Gay Mitchell spoke of having the Olympic games in Ireland. It is incredible to hear his party now saying that the money should be spent on health and social welfare and challenging anybody to object to that.</P>

If it is the view of Fine Gael that we never want to be in a position to host a major international sporting event, they should go to the people on that basis. Despite the recognised status of Ireland on every front, we would then have to acknowledge that we are so impoverished we cannot provide the facilities which even small countries like Luxembourg and Slovenia already have.</P>

      <P>I am sharing time with Deputies Farrelly, Allen, Owen and McCormack. I welcome the opportunity to again speak on this motion. For the second time, Fine Gael have felt obliged to devote Private Members' Time to the subject of Stadium Ireland. It continues to be an issue of huge public interest and concern across the country, for sports fans and others. As stated by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation last evening, this is one of the largest single projects ever undertaken by any Government in this State. I wish to make a number of points quite clear in response to Deputy McDaid's inaccurate and petty comments relating to Fine Gael last night. They were politically motivated and had no foundation. To suggest that my party is not interested in the development of sport and sporting infrastructure is nonsense and he knows it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that Fine Gael was responsible for the introduction of a national sports capital programme funded by the national lottery introduced by Deputy Donal Creed in the 1980s. Fine Gael under Deputy Allen as Minister was also responsible for a national plan for sport which was supported by all parties in this House. That the Government has more money at its dis<Col N="644" /> posal to spend on sport should not be twisted to create an impression that the Government parties have a monopoly on sporting interest in this House. Nothing could be further from the truth. Fine Gael does not have a problem with the principle of a national stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan even objected to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor does it have a problem with a centre of sporting excellence in campus Ireland. We support the idea behind sporting campus Ireland as it would provide a top class facility for top athletes to fulfil their full potential. The aquatic centre is a vital development as we prepare for the 2003 Special Olympics, something I am very proud we are involved in. What this debate is about is simple. It is about the development of a giant 80,000 seat stadium outside the centre of Dublin which we feel will cost a fortune and may turn out to be a disaster in many other ways. There are a number of valid grounds for our concerns and first is cost. No matter what spin the Minister wants to put on the figures the total cost of building this stadium and the infrastructure to make it work properly will be close to £1 billion.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to undertake a review of direct and indirect costs of the stadium project suggests one of two possibilities to me. The first is that the Government did not before now, undertake a comprehensive costings of this project that they can rely on. That is unbelievable. The second possibility is that taxpayers money is being spent on a second costings exercise in order to satisfy the Opposition and the minority Government party. How can there be any doubt in the Taoiseach's or the Minister's mind about costings at this stage of the project?</P>
      <P>Another reason for concern is location. Does it make sense to build a stadium for 80,000 on a site to which people will have to be ferried from the city and the country when an 80,000 seat stadium already exists and is under utilised and within walking distance of Heuston station, Connolly station and Busáras?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be a national stadium as soccer or rugby cannot be played there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The third reason is viability. There are a number of large recently built stadiums across the world in countries with far larger populations than Ireland and in cities with far larger populations than Dublin. They are turning out to be financial disasters for example Stade de France, Stadium Australia and now the proposal for a new Wembley stadium which may not go ahead in London. I will be honest and say that the idea of a national stadium for 80,000 people excites me as a sports participant and fan, but we must be realistic. Can Dublin support two 80,000 seat stadiums? Is there not a danger that if we <Col N="645" /> build a second both may find it impossible to survive financially?</P>
      <P>I mention the opportunity cost &ndash; or maybe I should say the opportunity lost &ndash; of the project in relation to the value of other projects that could have been funded with the massive amount of money that is being spent on this project. Fine Gael made it quite clear, Deputy Allen in particular, that we have a bottom up approach towards building an infrastructure. We need to fund local clubs and sporting facilities across the country before we spend a fortune on a national stadium. This year nearly 1,500 clubs across the country have applied for lottery funding for capital grants. How many of them will receive the grants for which they have applied?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>By the way, the number that will be successful will not all be able to use the funds for which they have applied but will hand some back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The number who will be successful will be far less than those that should, I would imagine and yet the Government is happy to move ahead with a project that will cost nearly £1 billion. My case rests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this issue. We are all human and most will have played sport at some time in our lives. A national complex will be welcome. What annoys me about this is the way the Government and the present Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation have tried to achieve it. They have split the FAI right down the middle and the chief executive is gone within a month of the decision to get the FAI on board. That was done with taxpayers money. The Taoiseach went to the GAA the day before the national conference took place. On its agenda was one of the most important votes to take place in 50 years. The Taoiseach wanted it carried and without approval from the Cabinet he offered money. That is a fact.</P>
      <P>The Government has not taken into consideration the £250 million for 'Bertie's Bowl' or the stadium itself. To date £187 million has been or will be spent to move the staff from Abbotstown. It was to be £90 million but now it is £187 million and that is without taking any account of the price of the land. It is worth £150 million on today's market and that should be included in the cost. I hope the consultants will be given the proper instructions to bring back the total cost to the State of providing this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. It should be included in the cost. Do not underestimate or avoid telling the facts. That is what the Minister did on the radio this morning and very poorly, if I may say so. In relation to the costs, nobody has a problem with substantial funds being given to <Col N="646" /> the GAA or the FAI although clubs around the country have poor facilities. One thing I would like to see if this proposal goes ahead &ndash; and it looks like the Government intends staying in office long enough to see it going so far that it cannot be reversed &ndash; is a cap on the cost. It should be £250 million only and the rest of the money should come from the private sector. There is enough money in that sector. In the event that we cannot afford to run all of these stadiums, will the Government proceed, as happened in England with the Dome, with huge amounts of money being spent on a continual basis and the national lottery becoming the fund to keep it going? Then the Government might talk to the individual investors who might want to buy it from the Government for nothing. I do not like the way this is being done and somebody should call stop and say that a certain amount of money only will be provided on condition the rest of it comes from the private sector. That is the way this should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I have not seen the auction politics that were around in the early 1980s revisited as they have been in recent months. On a Friday night the Taoiseach could have £80 million or whatever and then the Minister could be with the FAI trying to break their proposals for a covered stadium where soccer could be played hail, rain or snow. A covered stadium was the thing to have in a climate where the last three days have been the first three days during which it has not rained in 18 months almost. Auction politics have been revisited with taxpayers money and the Minister is part of it. It is wrong. It was wrong in 1982 and the Minister and the Taoiseach have put the auction politics of the early 1980s in the ha'penny place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's dream of a national stadium has turned into a political nightmare for him as costs escalate from £250 million to at least £1 billion. I am amused at the PD's sudden political strength or posturing on this issue. Any PD reading the report on the examination of Stadium Ireland by the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, 14 September 2000, should have reacted then. When I calculated as a result of evidence from Mr. Paddy Teahon, principal director of the project, that Stadium Ireland would cost at least £1 billion, it was met with disbelief by many in the Oireachtas and the in media. Seven months later, having spent several millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, the Progressive Democrats have suddenly discovered their political backbone in questioning the project. As the saying goes &ldquo;it is never too late&rdquo;. I welcome its belated conversion to questioning this madcap project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I questioned it for different reasons. Planning a 21st century project when our national sporting infrastructure in places is of a 19th century standard is getting priorities askew. The development of a national stadium contradicts the 1997 national plan for sports which was supported by <Col N="647" /> all parties in the House. The project is being pushed by powerful commercial interests rather than by the real sportsmen and women who work long and hard to develop their respective sports. Major investment in a spectator facility, rather than in developing participatory sports, is to get the priorities wrong yet again.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have little time to present further opinions but refer to my statements to the Dáil on 30 and 31 January 2001, as well as my views expressed in the Oireachtas committee on 14 September 2000 where Mr. Teahon and his associates floundered in attempting to answer questions posed by me and other committee members. Mr. Teahon and his associates were equally unconvincing in a subsequent private meeting in answering questions about use of the facilities and the scale of priorities in the national plan for sport.</P>
    <P>There are powerful vested interests pushing this project and I wonder what influence they have on the Taoiseach. A £50 million donation was the catalyst for the stadium and, despite attempts to get further details of the contract between the donor and the Government, all we have is the copy of a contract from a Swiss bank, which gave an undertaking on behalf of an unnamed client. It is in the Oireachtas Library and this is a matter of public record. I am also concerned that a company appointed to pull the project together has a cast iron contract giving it a gross of 1.8% of the development costs. It has a vested interest in pushing the stadium to a point of no return.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation defused the political crises caused by the Progressive Democrats' revolt by promising an independent study of the project and this gets the Progressive Democrats off the political hook. I am concerned that as a prime promoter of the stadium, the Minister, will select the consultancy firm to assess it. Mr. McDaid cannot be trusted on this issue. To justify his stance he reduced himself to heaping personal abuse on his critics in a hysterical interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning.</P>

The saying &ldquo;he who pays the piper calls the tune&rdquo; is relevant to this situation and it is not too late for the Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, or an all-party committee of the House, to assess the project, which could be one of the most expensive ever undertaken and which is unlikely to give the return to the taxpayer on the investment. The massive investment would be better spent on developing a major, modern national sporting infrastructure to cater for young and old alike at all levels of ability.</P>

      <P>Minister, you will not be able to fulfil those. I have a few pertinent questions. Could we have the real story as to why the Office of Public Works resiled from this project and went back to hold the Minister's hand? I heard that it was unhappy with the way it was managed. Why, on 19 April, did an advertisement appear looking for project management services? Was not McGahey and Company to provide that? A huge advertisement appeared in the journals in European states and applicants have two weeks to reply. It says that by mid-May the Minister intends to appoint a project management services team. I thought that was there already. What conflict of interest might have existed in a consulting engineering firm, hired to give advice to McGahey and Company, finding themselves to be the winner of part of the contract for the aquatic centre? Is there anything odd in that? Perhaps he will get an opportunity to explain some of these discrepancies. Why is the project management services team being appointed a year after some work was awarded? Does the Minister know what is happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>My constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, sat beside the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation but did not support him in this project. My other constituency colleague, Deputy Fahey, said that in 1991 as Minister of State with responsibility for Sport, he put a proposal to the GAA to allow three soccer and three rugby games to be played in Croke Park. He could not have made a better case than Fine Gael's for developing it as the national stadium. The Taoiseach's announcement of a £60 million grant to Croke Park on the eve of the GAA congress ensured that it did not need to open it to other field sports. In return, the GAA agreed to play some of its games at Stadium Ireland and to confine Croke Park to Gaelic games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the result which the Taoiseach wanted so as to press ahead with spending £1 billion of taxpayers' money on the national stadium. He did not have Cabinet approval for that £60 million and one must assume that his promise was, at <Col N="650" /> best, a bluff or, at worst, a bribe. Is the Taoiseach so obsessed with this project that he is prepared to spend £1 billion when a few weeks ago the Government challenged a £400,000 award to Mrs. Synott in the Supreme Court case concerning her son? It is extraordinary and questionable that he is proceeding with the project. Imagine how that sum could be used if it was distributed to communities to provide much needed sports facilities in every locality. What would it do for people on hospital waiting lists? What would it mean to the parents of children who have been on waiting lists for orthodontic treatment for four or five years? I advise the Government to call a halt to the haste with which it is trying to push ahead with the Taoiseach's pet project when there are other more urgent demands on finances. The Taoiseach must now take responsibility for the backward decision of the GAA Congress not to open Croke Park to other games.</P>
    <P>We now discover that this grant to Croke Park has not been approved by Cabinet and there is serious doubt hanging over it. Even if Croke Park now gets this money, it will not solve the long-term problems of the GAA. It will still face difficulty in generating the necessary income from a small number of fixtures, especially now that they are to play some of their matches up to all-Ireland semi-finals in the proposed new stadium.</P>
    <P>The Government will be forced to rethink its policy on the national stadium. As a life-long member of the GAA, I believe the GAA will be forced to rethink its policy on excluding other sports from Croke Park. I do not worry about the Progressive Democrats. They will troop into the lobbies tonight behind the Government.</P>

      <P>I am a firm believer in <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>, but I do not believe that an 80,000-seater stadium will be any help in keeping either healthy bodies or healthy minds. We need facilities, and I have no objection to the provision of racing tracks, swimming pools and so on, but building an 80,000-seater stadium that will not be used except rarely, is farcical, as is the idea that the GAA would be expected to transfer matches out of its excellent top-class Croke Park stadium in order to give the impression that the new stadium is needed.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am a GAA man so the Minister need not talk nonsense to me. Croke Park is there for GAA matches. If it was overcrowded or there were not enough Sun<Col N="651" /> days on which to play Gaelic and hurling matches there, I could see matches being played in the new stadium. However, that is not being suggested because of shortage of time but simply to provide a cover for a new stadium that is not needed. The GAA is being asked to take out its matches, but last Sunday's league final could have been played out there with 22,000 people attending. There are only one or two matches, the all-Ireland final and maybe an exceptional clash at semi-final stage where attendance would border on 70,000, not to mention 80,000. This is baffling as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>I would love to see the money spent on sport. I am all for that, as is my party. The attacks on Deputy Michael Noonan tonight showed that he got to the nub of the matter. Government speakers talked balderdash about his attitude. He got to the core of the issue and showed what happened in other countries. I read an article last Sunday to which I replied and maybe the reply will be in print next Sunday; the idea that any journalist would describe those who oppose the building of this stadium as a misinformed mob&mdash;</P>

I also have the support of the Fine Gael organisation in the constituency and of the great majority of ordinary people, community organisations and community activists.</P>
      <P>The infrastructure of Dublin West cannot cope with current demands, never mind the burden of an 80,000-seater stadium. We are told that this infrastructure will be provided. However, we have heard that before, and the gridlock at 3.00 p.m. tells us not to rely on such promises. The infrastructure should be put in first, and then we will consider the reality of the Taoiseach's dream.</P>
      <P>There are areas of serious social need in the greater Blanchardstown area, in Lucan, Clondalkin and other areas of west Dublin where a portion of this estimated £1 billion would substantially increase the quality of life. The hospitals in Blanchardstown could do with some money too. The health of our young people would be improved more by the provision of physical education teachers in national schools than by any &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;. The future of young people in every town and village would be greatly enhanced by the provision of alternatives to the pub.</P>
      <P>I will not attempt to repeat the arguments of my colleagues in relation to the national perspective. I make no apology for being local, even parochial, on this matter &ndash; that is why we are elected on a geographical basis to this House. From the very beginning, the Taoiseach has been determined to push this project through. That is why there was so little emphasis on local consultation and local wishes. That is why, in relation to those who had reservations about this project, he attempted to intimidate one half of them and to bribe the other half. I noted with satisfaction, in the course of this Fine Gael initiated debate, a headline in one of our national papers which read &ldquo;Government backs down on cost of Bertie Bowl&rdquo;. I hope in three months' time, when a truly independent assessment of the stadium project will have been completed, that sanity will return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael is very much aware of the value of sport and the importance of having as wide a participation as possible. However, our priority must be to make sport available to as many potential participants as possible in all parts of the country. Providing a £1 billion stadium in Dublin will not achieve that aim. Massive investment in such a scheme will do little or nothing for those involved in sport in Donegal, Galway, Clare or any part of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister with responsibility for sport informed me that in 2001, 95 applications had been received from sporting organisations and clubs in Donegal for lottery funding. The total projected cost of all these applications from Donegal alone is £15 million. I am sure a similar number of applications have been received from other counties. Would it not be more sensible to allocate surplus funds to these clubs and organisations to underpin and develop sporting facilities in their areas? It is a sad state of affairs that rural communities that are anxious to provide essential sporting and recreational facilities are often dependent on community employment schemes to finance their projects. Given the enthusiasm and dedication of these community employment scheme workers, they deserve a lot more support in their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Creed mentioned that a large number of schools are without sports halls and PE facilities. The Minister, Deputy McDaid, is well aware that Donegal is no exception. In my <Col N="654" /> parish, Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair, which was built well over 20 years ago and has between 300 and 400 pupils, does not have a sports hall. The same can be said of Dunloe community school, Arranmore post primary school, Tory Island post primary school, Coláiste Cholmcille and Ballinamore. The list goes on and on. They do not even have sports halls. At a time when sport and PE are becoming an integral part of our educational curriculum, it is unbelievable that so many schools are left without these basic requirements. Surely, our priorities must be more realistic.</P>
    <P>Should we not respond positively to the organisations that have applied for funding towards the development of sporting facilities in their own areas and throughout the country? If we have a £1 billion to spend, let us spend it on the ground and give everyone an opportunity to participate, rather than some spectators in Dublin.</P>

Innisfails in Coolock got nothing except what it got from local authorities. This proposal is not for this time. It may at some time become a realistic proposition when all other sporting and social needs of the needs of the nation have been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our communities must be sported by facilities which serve the needs of the people. At this time <Col N="655" /> Government should be encouraging all its citizens to become actively involved in sport, irrespective of age. The State should be promoting a programme of participation in some form of physical exercise by the citizen. The benefits of such a scheme are many, from improving the physical health of the person to improving their mental well being and, importantly, their stress level would be reduced. Considering this Government's lack of policy to deal with the issues which generate high stress level, one would expect that the Government would put in place strategies to compensate for its lack of pro-active policies in the areas of transport, health and education.</P>
    <P>This proposal escalates in cost daily with unreal costing assigned to it from its inception. Currently, it has a price tag of £1 billion &ndash; a figure which in reality is an underestimation due to the cost which will be incurred. Should the project be proceeded with given that issues such as lack of transport infrastructure are not sufficiently costed in this proposal? The damage to the adjacent community has not been considered. The strain on the M50 would be such as to turn it into a virtual car park.</P>

      <P>He does not use sport for political advantage, nor do we in Fine Gael. There is an attempt by the Taoiseach to brand himself as spectator extraordinary &ndash; Irish sports spectator extraordinary &ndash; and to rebrand Fianna Fáil as the party that is interested in sport and, as a consequence, rebrand the rest of us as having no interest whatsoever in it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The difficulty with Stadium Ireland is that there is no grip on the finances. The figures provided by various Department and by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation have now exceeded £940 million and that is not allowing anything for the value of the site or any possible overruns there may be on the contract. The Government announcement by the Minister yesterday on Question Time that there would be an independent evaluation of the stadium seems to be a smokescreen given what he said this morning. Fianna Fáil intends to push ahead with the building process, irrespective of the cost to the taxpayer. It will do this despite the warnings of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in the House last night.</P>
    <P>Last night's debate highlighted the gulf that exists between parties in Government and the major contradiction that still exists regarding the treatment of the stadium. The Minister assured the House last night that the stadium project &ldquo;is not being provided at the expense of other more worthy projects&rdquo;, but the problem is that the Minister was followed a few minutes later by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who completely contradicted him. He said that &ldquo;Abbotstown can only proceed by displacing other projects&rdquo;. It will not be provided at the expense of other projects, according to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, but it can only proceed at the expense of other projects, according to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.</P>

      <P>They spoke one after the other. What is going on? What kind of con job is being attempted here? The Minister is trying to pull the wool over the House's eyes in regard to the cost and about the evaluation. He seems to have codded the Progressive Democrats as well about this project. The Minister went on radio this morning and gave a different reason for the evaluation of the project. He said that because of the public furore that has been caused, they are now looking at all the costs.</P>

      <P>The comments made by the Minister this morning &ndash; I admit that he may not be held totally responsible for the remarks he made because he seemed to be in the advanced stages of hysteria &ndash; beg the obvious questions, who was calculating the costs up to now, how reliable have <Col N="657" /> the costs been and is the total cost even more than, in general terms, the £1 billion?</P>
      <P>The Government would be well advised to look at what happened to the new Wembley Stadium. The costs are spiralling at Wembley. The original projection was £334 million sterling but this has now passed £700 million sterling and is still rising. The private sector, which was supporting the stadium, has pulled out because it believes the project at a cost of £700 million is not viable and that there will not be sufficient international games played there to generate the revenue necessary to keep the stadium going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday a Minister in the British Government refused to bail out a project saying it was <Col N="658" /> time the developers of Wembley &ldquo;should consider something a bit less grandiose&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is advice this Government should follow. Will the Minister not accept that the Government will spend £1 billion of taxpayers' money to create a white elephant which will not pay for itself? I predict that if the Government goes ahead it will sell the stadium within four years to the private sector at about quarter the cost, as happened the Millennium Dome in London.</P>

    <P>and a Protocol to that effect being attached to the next EU Treaty.</P>
    <P>I am well aware this is a cumbersome article to insert in the Constitution. I am also aware it deals only with one issue and the Nice Treaty involves many different issues to which I alluded in my Second Stage contribution. It is a parliamentary device to encourage debate and, above all else, I am anxious that there be debate in this House. It is important that we engage the public because Nice means nothing for many of them. I would hazard a guess that if one were to ask people which they had more interest in, the Leeds United match or a debate on the Nice Treaty, many would opt for the former. I dread to think of what the turnout will be in the referendum on 7 June. A turnout of less than 30% will mean we have a serious problem.</P>
    <P>I believe the direction in which the EU is heading is wrong and that it is alienating people. Fewer people will participate in EU referenda or take an interest in the development of the EU. In effect, the European Union is now based on the twin pillars of bureaucracy and industrialism. That leaves ordinary people far behind. Unfortunately, we will see the manifestation of this in the rise of the political right and in the alienation of certain sectors. We have already seen it in the May Day demonstrations where people give vent to their powerlessness and anger against what they see as corporate greed. They see the corporations taking over the European Union.</P>
    <P>Some of the Minister's officials might recognise a degree of plagiarism in this amendment. They <Col N="664" /> would be correct because I borrowed heavily from the Danish protocol. Members will remember that the Danes, in 1992, had the temerity to reject the Maastricht Treaty. I recall watching the ashen faced Tommy Gorman report it on RTE; he could not understand how the Danes could do such a thing. I was asked at the meeting the other day what would happen if there were a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on 7 June. I believe there would be another referendum and further referenda until the result was the right one. One must ask if that is real democracy as well. To what extent do the people have a say?</P>
    <P>The Danes achieved a concession. There was a negotiated settlement among the Heads of State which resulted in the attachment of a protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty. The Minister might argue, correctly, that the Danes are members of NATO. However, this raises another interesting debate within the EU, the tension between those who wish to take the NATO route and the traditional leftists who envisage the EU developing in a different way in that they wish it to move away from NATO and develop a strictly EU identity in terms of defence.</P>
    <P>I sought to intervene during the Minister's reply on Second Stage earlier today. The question I wished to ask the Minister &ndash; it is a question I asked during my contribution on Second Stage which I had hoped he would answer &ndash; is why the Finns and the Swedes no longer describe themselves as neutral. Why does NATO refer to the Finns, Swedes, Irish and Austrians as the former neutrals? Why does it refer to us as simply non-aligned? The Minister and every Member of this House knows the answers to these fundamental questions.</P>
    <P>Our neutrality has become a sham. It is something that is regularly trotted out, to the extent that it has become a mantra. It is part of the so-called neutral White Paper, which claims there will be no infringement of our neutral status. This is down to the Fianna Fáil Party, which appears to be infinitely flexible and adaptable when adopting these positions. I recall the Minister being asked, on the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme, to describe the ideology of the Fianna Fáil Party. He said&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. I am trying to convey the message that for too long this Government has put forward the line that Ireland is a neutral country. Fianna Fáil has put forward its credentials as a party that is defending Irish neutrality but that does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Earlier the Minister described me as half hysterical. During the debate on Partnership for Peace the Members on the Government benches said, when they were in Opposition, that they wished to defend Irish neutrality. However, they adopted a different line when they got into Government. When they refer to me being half hysterical they should consider the person who wrote the Taoiseach's speech on Partnership for Peace which the Taoiseach delivered when he was on the Opposition benches. He said the French would be in Killala, the Spanish would be in Bantry Bay, the Germans would be on Banna Strand and the British would be in the Curragh. I have never descended to those histrionics.</P>

      <P>I will quote Roger in a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all quote scripture for our own purposes. There was one line from the Fianna Fáil Party when it was in Opposition but it was quickly dispensed with when that party got into Government. It is a sham.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to answer my questions on Partnership for Peace. Recently Deputy Gregory and I were invited to NATO headquarters in Brussels. We asked a number of questions about Partnership for Peace. We asked if it was a stepping stone towards NATO. The answer was clear: &ldquo;Of course it is&rdquo;. They also said that Partnership for Peace was the saviour of NATO. However, I can recall the denials in this Chamber and the accusations that we were being over the top and hysterical. As the Minister might recall, we were told that as Ireland had signed the Amsterdam Treaty and embraced the Petersberg Tasks, signing up to Partnership for Peace was inevitable. We are getting the same type of answers today from this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also speaks about the requirement for a UN mandate. Perhaps he would clear up another confusion in this regard. He claims that Irish legislation demands that there be a UN mandate. However, Deputy Michael Higgins will recall a recent newspaper article of his in which he clearly pointed out that the European rapid reaction force was not established under the UN. Therefore, a UN mandate is not required. Is the Minister seriously telling the House that he would go to Herr Fischler and say: &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot go there because the Russians are objecting&ldquo;? It is a ludicrous position. I do not believe the Minister <Col N="666" /> can go to the Irish people with a straight face and claim a UN mandate will be required. This is also alluded to in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>If people reflect on the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty, they will recall that arguments in relation to European defence commitments which alluded to the fact that we would be sucked into greater militarisation were also dismissed.</P>
    <P>Yet there was no mention by those on the opposite benches that this would involve a 60,000 strong European rapid reaction force operating up to 4,000 km from EU borders. There was no mention of that yet here we are, involved in it. It is worth looking at the military implications of the annexes, which are seldom quoted.</P>
    <P>Article 1.5 of the Nice Treaty establishes a new EU institution referred to as the political and security committee which will exercise &ldquo;political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations&rdquo; and will direct military interventions during a crisis, including the waging of war. It is to be supported by an elaborate military-bureaucratic euro-Pentagon structure set out in the annexes to the Presidency report, which is referred to in the first declaration attached to the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>These run to 33 pages with seven annexes detailing the new EU military capabilities, the working of the political and security committee, the EU military committee and military staff organisation. Annex 7 contains details of &ldquo;standing arrangements for consultation and co-operation between the EU and NATO&rdquo;. This includes the possibility of command of an EU operation being put in the hands of NATO.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of Deputies, I suspect, have never seen these annexes, which show clearly the relationship between the EU and NATO. It is worth quoting from them to show what is involved and to show those who are interested in this debate the clear involvement of NATO. It states that in order to avoid unnecessary duplication it will, for the member states concerned, rely on technical data emanating from existing NATO mechanisms such as the defence planning process and the planning review process, or PARP. Recourse to these resources would be had with the support of the EU military staff, EUMS, via consultations between experts in a working group set up on the same model as that which operated for the drawing up of the HDF capabilities catalogue.</P>
    <P>The annex goes on to state that in addition, exchange of information and transparency would be appropriately ensured between the Union and NATO by the working group on capabilities set up between the two organisations, which would take steps to ensure the coherent development of EU and NATO capabilities where they overlap.</P>
    <P>That is very clear. Again, to quote&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a valid point and I am glad we are engaged in debate. The Deputy should trace this back to the Maastricht Treaty, where we had the eventual framing of a common defence and security policy and from there to the Amsterdam Treaty, which involved the progressive framing of a common defence and security policy. Now what do we have? We have the full integration of the Western European Union into the EU. I thank the Deputies for raising that matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding relations with NATO, the arrangements concerning transparency, co-operation and dialogue between the Union and NATO should be set out in the document on permanent arrangements between the Union and NATO. The evaluation mechanism is to take account of the following additional principles &ndash; the need for the countries concerned to ensure the compellability of the commitments taken on in the EU framework with the force goals accepted in the framework of the NATO defence planning process or PARP as well as the need for mutual reinforcement of the Union's capability goals and those arising for the countries concerned from the defence capabilities initiative.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, we are withdrawing our troops from the Lebanon and transferring that commitment to the EU rapid reaction force instead. Ireland is also committed to the <Col N="669" /> UN standby arrangement system to provide up to 850 personnel on overseas service at any given time. However, this is the same 850 we have also committed to the EU rapid reaction force. The Government's White Paper on defence indicated that it intended to maintain the UNSAS, the UN standby arrangement system, &ldquo;for the present&rdquo;. It appears that our rapid reaction commitments will win out. I have no doubt about that and it is worrying that Ireland may now be rowing in behind the trend away from UN service. The UN Brahimi report, published last August, is very relevant to my amendment. It states that many member states are saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to deploying formed military units to UN-led peacekeeping operations far more often than they are saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. In contrast to the long tradition of developed countries providing the bulk of the troops for UN peacekeeping operations during the organisation's first 50 years, in the recent years 77% of the troops in formed military units deployed on UN peacekeeping operations as of end June 2000 were contributed by developing countries. Deputy Higgins has referred to this on many occasions.</P>
      <P>The report, while acknowledging the stability work carried out by NATO-led operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo &ndash; what I would term a shotgun wedding between the UN and NATO, a most unsuitable match &ndash; states it is still the case that in many proposed UN operations, &ldquo;developed States tend not to see strategic national interest at stake&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My amendment says that Ireland does not participate in the elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions of the Union. I suggest that we use this opportunity to promote UN peacekeeping, which is a proud tradition of this country. We should not spend taxpayers' money to strengthen the EU's defence capability. If one follows the line of Jacques Delors and Jacques Chirac, tax revenue from this country will be spent on defence once a fully fledged European <Col N="670" /> defence union is in place. Is that what Irish taxpayers want? It is another reason I have tabled this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Brahimi report from which I quoted is very relevant to my amendment as it emphasises that the failures of the UN are far outweighed by its successes and that most of its failures can be attributed to the Security Council. I anticipate that many people will say that the UN has failed but I wish to clearly state that the UN has not failed when one takes finance and resources into account. Quoting from the Brahimi report once more: &ldquo;few of the basic building blocks are in place for the United Nations to rapidly acquire and deploy the human and material resources required to mount any complex peace operation in the future&rdquo;. A dependable supply of resources is not available, so I believe that we must channel our resources and energies in that direction.</P>
      <P>I am quite aware that within Fianna Fáil, over the years, there has been a debate between the Seán Lemass and Frank Aiken wings of the party. Mr. Lemass did not have much time for Mr. Aiken, which was a pity, but I am firmly on the side of the Aikenites, if they can be so called. I would like to speak on this at greater length, but the Chair seems to be quite severe tonight. Perhaps I will get another opportunity to speak and I would like to hear from other Deputies.</P>

Thirty years ago he said that <Col N="671" /> a Europe that is worth joining is worth defending and I agree with him, although that is not the issue. I do not believe that our neutrality, such as it is, is affected by developments in the European Union. Let us be blunt and admit that our neutrality is based on the fact that we did not join NATO and I do not believe we should join NATO now. Anything we do in the European Union will not propel us into joining NATO anyway, so where is the beef?

      <P>I wish to make clear that the basis on which Fine Gael originally advocated joining the Partnership for Peace was that every other country in Europe had done so, other than Tajikistan or Kazakhstan or a country in that region. We did not advocate joining the Partnership for Peace because we were interested in Ireland becoming a member of NATO, nor did most of the other non-NATO countries who have signed up to the Partnership for Peace. In the context of the debate that is necessary on the Treaty of Nice, it is important we ensure that peripheral issues which are not connected to the Treaty are not cited as a reason to encourage people to vote against it.</P>
      <P>I respect Deputy Gormley's position of advocating a vote against this treaty and I imagine he voted against previous treaties as well. His position is a little odd, however, in light of the position of the European Green Party but he is entitled to his view and I respect that. The debate must centre on the facts and we must not introduce issues which have nothing to do with the Treaty of Nice. My concern is to implore everybody to debate the issues as they are, including whether or not we are interested in enlargement, whether we want the treaty and whether we want to put institutions in place to facilitate enlargement. The central issue is whether we want to be the member state that blocks enlargement.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Nice is essentially a housekeeping exercise to allow enlargement; it has nothing to do with NATO, neutrality or militarism.</P>

It is quite clear from a careful analysis of the treaty that Ireland is not entering a single additional international security obligation that had not been entered into following the Amsterdam Treaty. That is clear to anyone who examines the treaty but it seems a scare campaign regarding Irish neutrality is to be mounted once again. Such a campaign was undertaken upon our entry to the EEC in 1972, during the debate on the Single European Act in the late 1980s, the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997 and is surfacing once more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the debate which takes place publicly will be informative, that it will elicit information and different ideas, and that it will be less characterised by heat. I welcome the issues which have been raised by Deputy Gormley as a contribution to a debate which is vitally necessary.</P>
      <P>There is no point in slotting parties into particular positions or stating that they are governed by periods of time in so far as the circumstances to which the Nice Treaty is directed &ndash; we are not speaking about the Treaty in totality here but this amendment &ndash; are ones which have new characteristics. For example, it is accepted by most thoughtful people that there is a crisis of governance in Europe and that parallel to that crisis, which would include the involvement of citizens, is a crisis of economic accountability. This raises the issue of the difference, which people who debate the Nice Treaty speak about, between a vastly increased integrated economic block and a Europe which will be increased by the arrival of the accession countries.</P>
      <P>However, there is one point on which agreement has emerged in the debate on this amendment, that is, that we should never again be in a position of concluding the legislative process which will facilitate a referendum about Europe in such a state of unpreparedness. Most of the issues which have been thrown up by Deputy Gormley will remain issues until 2003/2004. I would repeat the proposal by the leader of the Labour Party on Second Stage of the need for some forum in which all these different dimensions of Europe, which are not simply, can be teased out and debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gormley made reference to an article I wrote. I still hold those views. Of course my decision regarding the Treaty is one taken on balance. Following the exchange in the newspapers between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself regarding the UN mandate, which arises out of this and to which Deputy Gormley has referred, my view still holds. I do not believe that the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1960, for example, facilitates the involvement of Irish troops in tasks of the rapid reaction force in the way that the Minister stated on that occasion. The 1960 Act clearly states that more than 12 Irish soldiers can be committed to initiatives which have been established by the United Nations. Unfortunately this does not fit the Minister's argument where, regarding tasks which might be undertaken, he made the point that they would secure UN approval. There is a huge difference between securing a mandate <i>ex post facto</i> and actually conforming with the text of the 1960 Act, <Col N="675" /> which clearly indicates that one is talking about forces established by the UN. It is pushing the language of the Defence Act, 1960. It seems to me that it is not possible to find a construction of it which would enable the phrase &ldquo;established by the United Nations&rdquo; to cover events and circumstances in which the United Nations had no part in initiating.</P>
    <P>I want to be positive. Regarding the debate between now and, say, 2003 or 2004 on the issues which have been mentioned by Deputy Gormley among others, people should not be abusive of those opposing the Nice Treaty. They are actually making a case which has many valuable points. Among the points which will continue to be debated after the referendum and before the next Treaty is the gap between political accountability regarding security and the logistical control of security actions themselves. This is an area on which there is not clarity. Deputy Gormley quoted accurately from a briefing by NATO sources in Brussels, to which he and Deputy Gregory were invited. Certainly the US view of the rapid reaction force, for example, is very different from the British view, which is, in turn, different from the French view. One of the moral problems I have about all of this is that I have never been in favour of such a immobilisation of responses which would enable one to respond to a humanitarian crisis. If one is forced, for example, to take up the consistent position that one cannot be involved while at the same time there is genocide close to one's borders, I would come down in favour of interpreting one's actions in favour of preventing genocide and being able to do that. However, that raises the question about the definition of the tasks and the role of the political definition versus the logistical military capability. Depending on the side from which one looks at it, one will see that it is rather like the blind people touching the elephant, where one thought it was a rope and another thought it was a mountain. That issue will not go away. That is why we now need an informed debate on the Treaty in which we should be listing all of these issues.</P>
    <P>I also have a difficulty with inserting this amendment suggested by Deputy Gormley into the Constitution because it would be cumbersome. Apart from the fact that the amendment states that we shall &ldquo;not contribute to the financing of the operational expenditure arising from such measures&rdquo;, if they were humanitarian tasks defined within the Petersberg Tasks one would be incapacitated from action. It is not a simple matter.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on this point because there are other Deputies who want to contribute. On my remarks about the 1960 Act&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the following words in the amendment, that we shall &ldquo;not contribute to the financing of the operational expenditure arising from such measures&rdquo;, and whether that related to tasks to which one should or should not contribute.</P>
      <P>On the question regarding the UN, the Minister may want to develop this into a task which would have been initiated, approved or mandated by the United Nations. That depends on how he proposes to get past the veto on the Security Council, a point which has been raised by the proposer of the amendment. If the Minister says that he has proposals, through Ireland's membership of the Security Council, for getting past that, for example, through the recognition of such forces as emerge in Europe as regional expressions of the UN initiative, then it would help if that was said. There is a complex matter in this regard which we may debate another day. I would suggest that if that is the road the Minister wants to go down, he must revisit the Defence Act, 1960 and cannot escape doing so.</P>
      <P>One of the things which is very important in all of this is that we must have a debate about Ireland's neutrality in fairness to those who have spoken about it and still believe in it. It is not a case of it being some archaic concept. It is something which can be expressed positively in new conditions.</P>
      <P>Members spoke about security. The debate on security has hardly begun. There is its social basis and economic basis and there are the relationships between ethnic groups and culturally diffused peoples, etc.</P>
      <P>I would like to think those who articulate concerns will not consider them closed by whatever is the result of this vote. These issues will remain. We should realise that the Nice Treaty is one in a series of treaties; there will be another. There will be another intergovernmental process. We should commit ourselves to a public consultation on the complexity that faces us. We should particularly respect the debate that will be very difficult within the applicant countries. Their version of defence will reflect some anxious to be protected against <i>homo soveticus,</i> as they see it, others anxious, in a rapid sense, to join NATO because it is a most immediate source of security and others anxious to establish economic and social structures that will confer some autonomy on them. All this will raise a further and deeper question, in the new architecture of international relationships, in a geopolitics that may have a single superpower, what will be the shape of Europe as it is interested in humane resolution of conflict. For all these reasons it is best if we say we are listing the terms of the debate that will continue not only through the referendum, in what I hope will be a calm way but past it and that we will be better prepared for the following treaty.</P>

        <b>: </b>It is crucial we demand that the Government will not have anything to do with defence policy with regard to the EU. I am curious as to how members of the Government continue to say the Nice Treaty has nothing to do with security questions or with the common foreign and security policy; it has everything to do with these issues because it marks a consolidation to a strategy that involves the militarisation of the EU. Why does the Government not tell the truth about what the EU strategists are now about? Why will it not tell the truth, that the rapid reaction force is an EU army? It is a body of men and some women, 400 fighter aircraft and 100 ships. It has all the logistics that go with an army. Why will the Minister not call it an army? If one is confronted by an object that looks like an elephant, walks like an elephant and feels like an elephant, well it is an elephant.</P>

Some 39 of the top 100 arms producing companies in the world are EU based, accounting for a massive income from arms sales to every dirty dictatorship around the world. Even as we speak, EU arms are slaughtering innocent peoples and we now want to give those people a fillip with the so-called common foreign and security policy. In short, what we have here is an attempt to create an economic bloc of 500 million people, a huge market for the multinational corporations that dominate that bloc, and a military wing to rival the power of the United States and to carry equal weight diplomatically and in other ways in the world sphere.

      <P>There is one phrase Deputy Gormley did not use during his half-hour contribution. I listened to him very intently. I admire his persistence and I am sure he believes all this. It is a view.

      <P>It was not mentioned that we are talking about evolving an EU capacity to implement the Petersberg Tasks, how we get involved in crisis prevention, in civilian crisis management, in public administration and rebuilding, as we have seen in the Balkans. We should remember that former adversaries and people who are not members of NATO are working together to make sure that the Balkans, as bad as it is in 2001, is not the Balkans of 1914 or of 1940. The paradigm has changed. There is no point in continuing to regard the evolution of this capacity within the European Union for those purposes as being in some way a means of replacing an old Cold War paradigm, which is, we all know, no longer relevant. That is the basic problem in the presentation put forward.</P>
      <P>The amendment in its substance seeks to deny to us, as a country, the power to decide on a case by case basis whether we wish to participate in the Petersberg Tasks. When people sincerely say how proud they are of Ireland's contribution to the UN in many parts of the world, of which we are all proud, can we not equally be proud of what we can do to maintain peace and stability in Europe in crisis prevention tasks, as in the case of the problems re-emerging in those parts of south eastern Europe where we have seen the incapacity to prepare, plan and be available to avoid hundreds of thousands of people emanating from one country or one part of a country, depending on one's politics, to another impoverished country and having no prospect of a stable life in the future? When we get away from the theory and the easy arguments, it is important that that issue be put to the people.</P>
      <P>I genuinely want to move on to a public debate beyond the Treaty of Nice, as it has been characterised by Deputy O'Keeffe. Having been involved in all the negotiating sessions during the year, I want to get on to a structured debate on the other issues. In the balance of our national interests, we surely cannot say this democratic assembly will advise the people of Ireland to say 'No' to people in Eastern Europe who have suffered for long enough. If we do not agree with the liberal democratic model which is emerging, we should have a democratic debate on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue. I did raise it for the two weeks before Easter but it could not be facilitated then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in regard to the provision of primary education at St. Joseph's and St. Anne's schools in Rathkeale is very serious. The constitutional rights of the children to a full education are being denied. Pupils in these schools are being disadvantaged because of their unique social circumstances. Rathkeale town has the highest population of Travellers of any town in Ireland. Up to 45% of the population are Travellers. While there are some strains and difficulties, the settled community and the travelling community who live in the area have a high level of cultural understanding between them. The situation in Rathkeale is unique and unprecedented. We have been trying for years to have this recognised and the situation given assistance by State <Col N="683" /> bodies. The town's difficulties have been relatively ignored.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned with the situation prevailing in both schools. It is leading to an unacceptable climate and creating difficulties in imparting of knowledge by the teachers and acquiring of knowledge by the pupils. I stress that the national policy with regard to Traveller integration in schools is not an issue for the people of Rathkeale. It is the application of this in the special, unique and unprecedented circumstances that apply to Rathkeale town that is involved. The policy has a severely damaging and disastrous effect on the education system in the town. The application of age appropriate placement for all Travellers regardless of academic achievement is inherently wrong. This is because of the number of transient Traveller children presenting themselves for education. It is not appropriate for the children who are in constant attendance or for those who are in occasional attendance at the schools. It restricts both groups in these schools. Teachers have stated that in over 50% of classes where there are occasional attenders at different levels of ability, mainstream pupils suffer because the teachers do not have the time to help those with difficulties.</P>
    <P>Putting occasional students into age appropriate classes is unacceptable. What is the point in putting children who have no literacy or numeracy skills into fourth, fifth or sixth classes? Some pupils in these classes range from those learning the alphabet to those struggling with low second class textbooks. It is impossible for either mainstream pupils or the occasional transient pupils to benefit educationally. I, with the board of management of the schools, am extremely concerned about some pupil behaviour in the schools, especially St. Joseph's boys' school. This to a large extent results from the difficulty created because of the educational system in the schools which cannot cater for the needs of the children. The principle is policing rather than supervising. Rows have taken place in classrooms. The Garda have needed to visit because of the level of disruption and concern over pupils' safety. The two groups &ndash; mainstream and occasional/transient &ndash; complete school at different times because of concern for pupil safety. Games and most extra curricular activities have been abandoned.  </P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science must terminate the age appropriate placement of the transient Traveller pupils. It is restricting the development of the mainstream pupils and severely damaging the self-esteem and educational development of these pupils who are in classes beyond their ability. This frustration expresses itself in poor behaviour by the children concerned.</P>
    <P>All pupils who enrol in the school after 30 September each year must have special classes with intensive education to bring them to the level to <Col N="684" /> attend the mainstream classes. Adequate classroom assistants must be made available urgently to ensure proper behaviour. I urge the Minister of State, who made a statement yesterday, to do this. Legal action will be taken against the Department of Education and Science because of the inadequate education for both the mainstream and the transient pupils. Parents feel discriminated against and that there is no hope for their children completing their early academic study.</P>
    <P>There may be a withdrawal of pupils for the sake of their education by parents, most of whom attended schools in their own time in Rathkeale. The parents must not be placed in the position of seeking to send their children to schools in other areas. This would be disastrous. The mainstream pupils include members of the Travelling community whose parents are concerned about the school's regime. This is the Traveller community which is not transient and sometimes return for the sake of their children's education. They are as concerned as the other parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House our Department's current position regarding this matter. I am aware of the complex situation existing in the schools at Rathkeale and the Minister for Education and Science is committed to ensuring that an education of the highest standard is available for all pupils in these schools.</P>
      <P>Age appropriate placement applies to all children. It is the Government's policy that all children, including Traveller children, participate in mainstream education in age appropriate classes and in an integrated setting. Pupils in all classrooms learn and progress at different rates, and the days in which less advanced or &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; pupils were repeatedly held back is long gone. The practice often demoralised children and had a serious effect on their self-esteem. The primary school curriculum is designed so that the needs of children of different abilities can be met in the classroom. Training courses for teachers emphasise the use of group learning and other techniques to respond to varying learning needs. This approach has been a core principle of the primary curriculum for many years and is re-emphasised in the revised primary curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resource teachers for Travellers in the Rathkeale schools, as in other schools, are deployed in such a way as to ensure that Traveller children receive any learning or other support required according to their educational needs. This can involve the resource teacher working in conjunction with the class teacher in the classroom or withdrawing Traveller children for additional learning support, as required. The nature and duration of support provided during withdrawal to resource teachers is determined in <Col N="685" /> the light of the needs of the individual children as identified by the class teacher, the resource teacher, the visiting teacher for Travellers and the inspectors from our Department.</P>
    <P>Education should recognise and celebrate the culture and background of all pupils. The integration of Traveller and settled pupils in school is an important strategy for achieving this objective. It enables pupils to learn about, respect and appreciate diversity and can, in this way, contribute to the achievement of a tolerant and inclusive society. These are crucial goals that require sustained commitment by all involved &ndash; parents, pupil, teachers, management, the local community and the personnel of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The Minister ensured that our Department works closely with the schools and parents in Rathkeale to achieve high quality teaching and learning for all the pupils. He ensured that very considerable extra resources have already been given to the schools, including extra teachers, enhanced capitation grants, visiting teachers for Travellers (who work with the families of Travellers and the staffs of schools), as well as intensive support from the inspectorate and the school development planning service.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the excellent work which is already ongoing in the schools. I congratulate and thank the school staffs, the members of the boards of management, parents, visiting teachers for Travellers, inspectors from our Department, and the school development planning facilitators who are working intensely to ensure that an inclusive and high quality education is available for all the pupils.</P>
    <P>Officials and inspectors from our Department were engaged in dialogue with the parents, patron, boards of management, principals, teachers and parents' council. They agreed to put in place an extensive process of review and analysis of the practices and methods being employed in the school. That process is now under way. Teachers, inspectors and facilitators from the school development planning initiative are working to identify what needs to be done to address the concerns of parents and to ensure a high quality inclusive education for all pupils. The process of review will consider the utilisation of current resources for Traveller education in Rathkeale and, indeed, whether further resources and supports are required to take matters forward.</P>
    <P>I assure the parents of Rathkeale that this process of review will be open and flexible, and will involve consultation with parents of all the children. The views and concerns of parents will form an integral part of the action plan. The draft will be completed by mid-May and will also be subject to periodic review. I urge all to work constructively together for the success of the process. This will ensure that an excellent standard of education is provided for all pupils and the contri<Col N="686" /> butions of children from all backgrounds are respected and valued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to share my time with Deputy Penrose. Choláiste Choinn Torc, Castlepollard, County Westmeath, has a well motivated, dedicated staff providing an excellent education for the 150 enrolled pupils. It is the focal point for about 180 adults enrolled for adult education classes, mainly in IT. The existing school buildings are disjointed, piecemeal and rapidly deteriorating. They are archaic. It was identified as inadequate and 14 years ago the Minister for Education, Deputy Cooney, sanctioned major infrastructural works. This commitment was not pursued by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government. Eight years later, when the rainbow Coalition came to office, Deputy Breathnach, the Minister for Education, approved the school's upgrading and gave it priority status. This was again shelved when the Fianna Fáil Government came to power in 1997.</P>
      <P>After four years of this Administration, a new site was purchased, plans prepared and planning permission obtained. There has been foot dragging and petty hold-ups by the Minister and the Department frustrating the efforts of the principal, Jim White, and the parents' association in progressing the project. One can imagine the disquiet among parents, teachers and pupils when the roof of the domestic science room collapsed a few days ago because of dry rot and a roof which had leaked for years. The room has an obnoxious smell of dampness and decay. It is unsuitable for use for domestic science. This situation is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>The Minister must stop foot dragging and put the project to tender. Castlepollard parents have heard empty promises for too long. The board of management waited, expecting that the solemn promises of the Minister's representative at Castlepollard, who is a longstanding member of the Westmeath VEC, would materialise. They had empty promises day after day. The days of waiting and promises are over. The children and their teachers are entitled to adequate facilities. I call on the Minister to announce approval for the project to go to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity, in conjunction with my constituency colleague, Deputy McGrath, to raise the issue of the necessity of new buildings for Castlepollard's community college, Choláiste Chionn Torc, without any further delay. This has been long promised and deserves greater impetus and urgency after the disgraceful situation which arose on Friday, 27 April 2001, when part of the ceiling of the home economics room collapsed, necessitating its <Col N="687" /> complete evacuation, as Deputy McGrath stated. It was no longer safe or suitable for use due to a leaking roof, and had odours and signs of dampness and decay. The situation could have been more grave and serious, in that students had just completed part of the Department's examinations. It is a scandal for any Government or Department to permit such a situation to develop. It is a dereliction by the Department of its duties, responsibilities and obligations under health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>In the mid 1990s, after much agitation on my part, we got the commitment from the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, to the long-term future of Choláiste Chionn Torc. Yet we only appear to have arrived at stage three of this project, which is nothing more than a developed sketch. Is it not true that this submission is lying in the Department's building unit since 8 March 2001, and nothing has been done? The Department agreed to group stages 3, 4 and 5 of this important school project to allow it to proceed to tender. Has the Minister no shame? What is the problem? Is it being delayed or long-fingered because of lack of resources to permit to proceed with all possible speed? If that is not the position, the Minister should request his building unit to set in train an accelerated process in relation to this project and to immediately stop the process of foot-dragging, dawdling and general obfuscation.</P>
      <P>As a result of the latest catastrophe, students will unfortunately be deprived of home economics classes for the remainder of the term. This will cause disruption to the classroom tables. The students, rightly, refuse to use the room in its primitive and archaic condition. The situation on the ground is now unbearable and at breaking point, and the people of Castlepollard and the surrounding areas in north-west Meath feel that moneys which are easily found by the Government for every pet project under the sun should be spent on important long-term infrastructural projects such as Coláiste Chionn Torc.</P>
      <P>There are 150 students in the school and almost 200 enrolled in the area for which the Minister of State has responsibility, the adult education courses, making it one of the most popular schools in the country. A site was bought and planning permission has been obtained. All that remains is for positive action to be taken to get the school project out to tender, award the contract and commence the project. I look forward to a positive reply from the Minister. It is the least that Castlepollard Community College, the staff, the parents and students deserve.</P>

      <P>The current school, Coláiste Chionn Torc has 151 pupils enrolled: 75 boys and 76 girls. Some years ago the Department of Education and Science received an application from County Westmeath vocational education committee for replacement accommodation for the existing school which was built in 1937.</P>
      <P>A schedule of overall accommodation was issued by the Department to cater for a projected long-term enrolment of 200 pupils. This schedule was accepted by the VEC. In November 1996, the Department gave approval to the VEC for the appointment of a design team. In April 1997 the Department approved the VEC's choice of design team personnel. In May of that year the VEC was told that it was in order to instruct the design team to prepare a stage 1 report on site suitability in accordance with the Department's design team procedures. Unfortunately, when this report was received within the Department, it was deemed to be unsuitable. Subsequently, a revised stage 1 report was received in November 1997. In January 1998, the VEC was advised to instruct the design team to proceed to stage 2, which is the outline sketch scheme.</P>
      <P>The stage 2 report was duly received in September 1998. An evaluation of this stage report within the Department revealed difficulties, including the lack of provision for temporary accommodation at the campus during the construction phase of the development. In an effort to resolve these difficulties, a meeting was held on 17 February 1999 between the chief executive officer of Westmeath VEC, the design team, the school principal and my officials. At this meeting, it became apparent that the optimal solution to the difficulties presenting was the acquisition of a green field site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision was informed by the elimination of the costs associated with temporarily accommodating staff and students during the construc<Col N="689" /> tion phase and by health and safety considerations.</P>
    <P>Following this decision, the VEC was asked to identify a number of sites in the Castlepollard area that might be suitable for a new school. Six sites were identified. These were examined by one of the Department's senior architects. Three of the sites were considered to be suitable. A list of five of these sites was sent to the Valuation Office in April 1999 for valuation. A valuer from the Valuation Office met the chief executive officer and they examined the sites. A 7.5 acre site &ndash; part of the lands at Kinturk Demesne &ndash; was chosen for the site at a cost of £428,570.00.</P>
    <P>The building unit of my Department received a stage 3, developed sketch scheme, submission of the Department's design team procedures from County Westmeath VEC on 16 March 2001. This submission is now being reviewed by the building unit of the Department, which will be in a position to revert to the VEC very shortly.</P>
    <P>The building unit of my Department was not informed of the collapse of the ceiling in the domestic science section until mid-day today, Wednesday, 2 May, and I understand that officials from the Department are liaising with Westmeath VEC on this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair, and the Minister of State for coming in. I am disappointed that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, is not here.</P>
      <P>For much of the past few months we have had major discussions about the huge cost of Sports Campus Ireland. Constituents rightly believe that health, education and local sports facilities should take priority over the Taoiseach's obsession. A good example of the Government's mixed-up priorities is the reason for this Adjournment debate. Two outstanding and much-loved schools in Dublin North-East are each faced with the loss of a member of their teaching staff because they marginally missed getting the required number of students last September. Both schools will be severely hampered in their vital work for the parishes of Baldoyle and Sutton. The Minister must review the situation urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of the schools is St. Peter and Paul's Boys' national school, Brookstown Road, Baldoyle, an excellent primary school. It is now faced with the loss of its tenth assistant teaching post for the 2001-02 academic year. The school currently has 263 pupils with a junior infant intake of 41. Between senior infants and fifth class, class sizes range from 28 to 39 pupils, much higher than the pupil-teacher ratio claimed by the Government. Retaining the tenth post would mean that the clear demand for enrolment at junior infant level would be met and it would go some way <Col N="690" /> towards alleviating the effects for the other pupils in very large classes.</P>
    <P>Baldoyle parish is part of the Northside Partnership area, a partnership of which I am proud to be a director and chairperson of its education sub-committee. The local parish development agency, the Baldoyle forum, has identified early education as a key factor in lifting parts of the parish out of deprivation. For this reason, St. Peter and Paul's has been included in the new programme for pupils in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds. Baldoyle parish is also expected to have a massive upsurge in population over the coming years. The local Baldoyle action area plan, currently before Fingal County Council, provides for an additional 2,600 new homes while an extra 10,000 to 30,000 homes are planned for the adjoining areas of Donaghmede and Portmarnock. Key services are currently being installed in these designated areas, and construction should begin within two years.</P>
    <P>St. Fintan's national school, Carrickbrack Road, Sutton, is also a wonderful school which has always been at the heart of social activities and developments in Sutton parish. The prospect of losing a teaching post in St. Fintan's for the next academic year will mean that the junior infant class will have at least 35 children, which is completely unsatisfactory from the viewpoint of pupils, teachers and parents. It will also mean that some children, including siblings of pupils already attending St. Fintan's, will be refused places in the school and the school's future capacity to service a growing community will be restricted.</P>
    <P>Sutton parish, which adjoins Baldoyle, is also a steadily growing community. Many new and young families have settled in the area in the past few years and over 175 children attend pre-school facilities in the immediate area. St. Fintan's is at the start of a growth cycle, but is now being judged only on the number of applicant children in 2000. The school has applications from over 50 children this year, many of whom are siblings of children currently at St. Fintan's. Some of these will not gain entry and will, therefore, have to apply to attend schools elsewhere, thus placing added stress and strain on already hard-pressed families where often both parents work.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Woods, personally opened the new St. Fintan's national school in 1982 in one of his many periods of ministerial office. It would be ironic if, as Minister for Education and Science, he allowed a situation where, through losing a teaching post for 2001-02, a massive blow would be dealt to this excellent school and its marvellous work for the people of Sutton.</P>
    <P>The loss of these key teaching positions from September 2001 will be a serious setback for the educational work of St. Peter and Paul's Boys' national school, Baldoyle and St. Fintan's national school, Sutton. I strongly urge my con<Col N="691" /> stituency colleague, Minister Woods, to reconsider these decisions and, for the reasons I have outlined, to maintain the staff numbers in both of these fine schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Woods, who is attending a meeting of school managers in Killarney.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities of primary schools and the INTO. A further 350 new posts have been allocated to primary schools for the coming school year. These posts, together with those arising from the demographic dividend, will mean significant improvements in the staffing schedule and the overall pupil teacher ratio in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The improvements in the next school year will include: additional staffing, following the introduction of the new administrative principal arrangements; a reduction in the appointment and retention figures for the second, third, fourth and fifth mainstream class teachers; and the allocation of further posts to tackle educational disadvantage within the terms of the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to St. Peter and Paul's Boys National School, Baldoyle, is that the enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 was 262 pupils which warrants a staffing for the 2001-2002 school year of a principal and nine mainstream class teachers. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The board of management of the school is seeking the retention of the tenth mainstream class teacher on the basis that the enrolment of the school for September 2001 is projected to increase.</P>
      <P>The board of management made representations last year regarding an increase in enrolment at the school for the current school year. The increase in enrolment did not occur and it declined by one pupil between 30 September 1999 and 30 September 2000. Accordingly, under the guidelines agreed with the managerial representatives of schools and the INTO, the present figures entitle the school to nine mainstream class teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment at St. Fintans' on 30 September 1999 was 367 pupils which warranted a staffing for the current school year of a principal and 13 mainstream class teachers. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher. The enrolment declined to 350 pupils on 30 September 2000. This enrolment warrants a staffing <Col N="692" /> of a principal plus 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-2002 school year. The principal of the school has indicated that the enrolment of the school will increase in September 2001. The only criteria by which a school in which enrolments are increasing may possibly gain an additional teaching post, apart from the numbers as determined by reference to the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year, is what is called &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria for the 2001-2002 school year are outlined in circular letter 12/2001, a copy of which the board of management of the school will receive in the next few days. To satisfy the criteria as outlined in the circular letter, the enrolment of St. Fintans' school on 30 September 2001 would have to increase by at least 30 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September 2000. Accordingly, the school would require an enrolment of at least 380 pupils on 30 September 2001.</P>
    <P>If the board of management of either school is confident they can satisfy the criteria for &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status, they should apply to the primary payments branch of the Department of Education and Science for the allocation of a teaching post.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Outer Ring Road.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter. It is predominantly a local authority roads matter, but it transcends various local authorities and has a serious impact on south Lucan and east Lucan. I ask the Minister to take an overview of the concerns of the people I represent in this House. The outer ring road was probably put on County Dublin development plan maps back in 1972. It is to link the Galway road with the Naas road and further afield. It was also on drawings to transcend the Liffey valley as an outer crossing parallel to the existing M50 motorway.</P>
      <P>In the last review of its development plan, Fingal County Council, in its wisdom, deleted this road. South Dublin County Council engineering and design personnel are beavering away with environmental impact statements, studies and designs, while the neighbouring local authority has decided that the road should come to a grinding halt at the Galway road junction. The likely scenario that emerges is a colossal build up of traffic on already over congested roads. The population in north Kildare and the eastern region generally sees tailbacks on the Galway road dual carriageway every morning. It now appears that it is intended that this outer ring road would terminate at a grade separated junction over the dual carriageway on the Galway road and add thousands more cars to an already congested situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> There seems to be no logic, cohesion or Department of Environment and Local Government overview to try to bring together neighbouring local authorities to do what is practical and realistic. Will the Minister ask a senior roads engineer in the Department of the Environment and Local Government to see what the alternative and more suitable solutions to this problem are? </P>
    <P>The outer ring road will see substantial commercial traffic going through a very large new residential area. It is also proposed and recommended in the recent Bacon report that a further 6,000 to 8,000 new homes be built in the adjoining area. It makes no commercial sense to proceed with what is proposed. It is now intended to make a dual carriageway of the outer ring road from the current Balgaddy roundabout to the Kingswood junction on the Naas dual carriageway. It will, effectively, become an attempted by-pass of a toll bridge on the Westlink, yet terminating nowhere other than pushing traffic back down through the old village of Lucan, back down to the Strawberry Beds and back on to the main dual carriage going into and coming out of town.</P>
    <P>It appears that the outer ring road being attempted by South Dublin Council has no logic, reason or practical use because of the decision of Fingal County Council. I urge that we move towards realism as to how traffic in that west side of Dublin can move. There have been many discussions about the rail service to Heuston station, the connection under the Phoenix park and the provision of a decent commuter rail service which has been talked about, planned and proposed. This infrastructural project makes no sense in the way it is being put together in a piecemeal manner by South Dublin County Council without consultation with neighbouring authorities. It appears, therefore, that it will create chaos at the Lucan end of the outer ring road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond and he has asked me to do so on his behalf. Statutory responsibility for determining applications for approval to environmental impact statements and compulsory purchase orders in respect of proposed road developments has been transferred from the Minister to An Bord Pleanála from 1 January 2001. The current position is that the environmental impact statement and compulsory purchase order in respect of the outer ring road in south west Dublin are with An Bord Pleanála for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outer ring road proposes to link the Galway road to the Tallaght by-pass <i>via</i> a grade separated interchange on the Naas road in accordance with the South Dublin County Council's 1998 development plan. An existing section of the scheme has been completed from the Gal<Col N="694" /> way road to the Balgaddy roundabout in recent years as development of adjoining areas has progressed. The proposed scheme follows a corridor reserved for this purpose on Dublin County Council's and later South Dublin County Council's development plan since the early 1970's. The lands abutting this corridor in the Lucan area were also zoned residential in the same plan and have since been developed.</P>
    <P>The completion of the outer ring road scheme forms an integral transport objective of the 1998 South Dublin County Council development plan which sets out the local authority planning policies and objectives for its area. The council has identified the need for the scheme to facilitate economic development of the area. This prioritisation is also endorsed by the original Dublin Transportation Initiative Strategy and has been reiterated in the updated Dublin Transportation Office Platform for Change strategy. The provision of the outer ring road is essential to the development of the Adamstown site in Lucan, one of the largest single residential development sites in the Dublin region having a capacity to accommodate some 8,000 housing units.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the proposed scheme will particularly improve infrastructure links between the towns of Lucan, Clondalkin and Tallaght within the council's area. The road will also service Grange Castle International Business Park which comprises 300 acres approximately and where a major multinational company is currently in the process of developing a facility that will provide 3,500 jobs.</P>
    <P>The construction of the outer ring road is also intended to improve the quality of life for residents in the Lucan area in that it will provide a further direct link between the Galway Road, the Nangor Road and the Naas Road and should reduce the extent of &ldquo;rat-running&rdquo; by motorists through existing residential areas. The proposed scheme would also support additional bus routes for the area. Cycleways and footpaths will also be provided which will link into existing and proposed amenities in the general area.</P>
    <P>Arising from a commitment by the Government under the Action for Housing programme, a total of £194 million is being provided in the 2001-04 period for non-national road schemes to support housing and other related developments in and around major urban areas. The outer ring road was one of 42 projects approved by the Department in December 2000 for funding under the new programme. It is expected that the 42 projects will facilitate the provision of more than 43,000 housing units and benefit more than 900 hectares of industrial land. The outer ring road was one of 42 projects approved by the Department in December 2000 for funding under the new programme. It is expected the 42 projects will facilitate the provision of over 43,000 housing <Col N="695" /> units and benefit over 900 hectares of industrial land.</P>
    <P>I understand the environmental impact statement and compulsory purchase order went on public display on 1 March 2001 and 9 March 2001 respectively and were subsequently submitted to An Bord Pleanála for approval on 5 March 2001 and 18 April 2001 respectively. A number of sub<Col N="696" /> missions have been received and an oral hearing will be arranged by An Bord Pleanála in the near future. It is expected the board should be in a position to decide on the environmental impact statement and compulsory purchase order by autumn 2001.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has for the implementation of the provisions of the report on school transport; if it is his intention to change or alter current catchment areas in response to population changes; and if he will provide a school bus service that will not necessitate a longer period than nine hours' school travel and attendance per day.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science on school transport in Ireland deals with a broad range of transport issues and contains many recommendations for changes to the school transport system.</P>
      <P>The report is the subject of an ongoing assessment, including costings, in the school transport section of my Department and in consultation with Bus Éireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. The Deputy will appreciate that, given the large number of these recommendations and taking account of staff limitations and the major implications in relation to funding, it is not possible to put all the recommendations in place with immediate effect.</P>
      <P>Some improvements have been announced in relation to areas where assessments have been completed. These include extended eligibility for pupils where bullying is proven or the nearest school building is physically unsuitable. In January I announced a range of improvements to the school transport scheme. The new improvements will cost in the region of £2.85 million a year.</P>
      <P>These include reducing the qualifying distance for primary school pupils aged ten or over from three miles to two miles so that all primary pupils will be treated equally for eligibility purposes. The number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new school bus service has been reduced from ten to seven.</P>
      <P>Improvements have also been made in relation to remote area and scheme D grants and the qualifying distance for post-primary pupils residing remote from a school bus route will be reduced from three to two miles.</P>
      <P>All school vehicles will have an on-board communications system fitted during the course of this school year. Arrangements will be made for all buses to have first aid kits on board by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre. The revision of catchment areas is addressed by my Department as the need arises. If the Deputy is aware of a particular area where such a revision would seem to be appropriate, I will have the matter addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>School bus routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable, while at the same time ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient and cost effective manner. The intention is to ensure that, as far as possible, travelling and waiting times do not exceed 2.5 hours for post-primary pupils and 1.5 hours for primary pupils. I reduced the travelling and waiting time from three hours to 2.5 hours this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998 provides that each school board of management must publish the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school, including the policy of the school relating to the expulsion of students.</P>
      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of expulsion only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Under the rules for national schools no pupil can be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>As expulsion from school is a matter for each school authority, my Department has no information on the numbers of pupils who may have been expelled over the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> The Education Act has also made provision for new appeal procedures in order to address grievances at school level, including expulsion. These procedures will bring a greater transparency to decisions by schools in relation to expulsion and also promote fair procedures at school level. In particular, the right to appeal to a national appeals committee in relation to a decision by a school to expel will bring a better balance to the rights and obligations of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I have also brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act to address generally issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a countrywide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second level schools. The Act requires schools to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any student. In such instances the role of the educational welfare officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to try and identify a mutually agreeable solution to provide for the education of the student concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, primary schools were selected on the basis of priority of need as reflected by reference to a range of socio-economic criteria. For example, unemployment levels, medical card holding and local authority housing occupancy among the families of pupils.</P>
      <P>It has been found that the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level is inflexible and does not take account of different levels of need. The scheme has generally focused on schools in larger urban areas while neglecting smaller but serious pockets of disadvantage in schools in medium sized towns around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further comprehensive survey of all primary schools was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000 at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Accepted socio-economic variables were used to compute an index of educational disadvantage for each school surveyed. These variables included unemployment, medical card possession and residence in local authority housing which have been found in the past to be <Col N="700" /> valid indicators of educational disadvantage at school level. Separate indices were used for rural and urban schools to reflect the findings of previous research that showed that educational disadvantage manifests itself differently in urban and rural locations.</P>
    <P>The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. The survey outcome forms the basis of the new programme entitled Giving Children an Even Break, a major initiative which I launched in January to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level over a three year period. Under this programme it is now proposed to refine our approach to ensure that the individual pupils at risk are targeted. The programme subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>All of the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme. More than 2,300 primary schools will benefit under this programme, based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the ERC survey. This involves an overall cost of £26 million including the allocation of over 200 additional teaching.</P>
    <P>Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, the Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>All of the schools participating in the new programme are being allocated additional resources to be used to provide targeted in-school and after school services for specific children at risk. Schools that were previously designated as disadvantaged will retain the resources that had been allocated to them and may also qualify for additional resources under the new programme based on the level of concentration of pupils at risk.</P>
    <P>The new programme will be subject to independent evaluation to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and to assist in its future development and the introduction of further interventions in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish experience in relation to examination performance of males and females mirrors the international experience. My Department has been engaged in a wide range of initiatives ranging from research to wider forms <Col N="701" /> of curricular provision and assessment in addressing the issue of under-achievement.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment commissioned educational research by a number of research agencies on this matter. This research included analysis of the factors contributing to the performance of candidates in examinations.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre conducted a longitudinal study of 1994 junior certificate candidates who took the leaving certificate examination in 1996 or 1997. Both the interim and the final reports of the longitudinal study on performance in the 1996 leaving certificate examination, of the cohort who sat the junior certificate examination in 1994, note that there is a tendency for boys to be over represented in the group of students receiving low grades of E, F and NG in the junior certificate examination at both ordinary level and higher level. This pattern continues into senior cycle and can be identified in the leaving certificate examination results. Boys are also under represented in the group achieving top marks.</P>
      <P>The study suggests that the work currently under way on curriculum and assessment in the junior cycle review by the NCCA may have a positive impact on under-achievement in the junior certificate examination and on subsequent achievement levels at senior cycle. Proposals to widen the range of modes and techniques of assessment in the junior certificate examination and consideration of providing greater flexibility in curriculum provision are considered to be particularly significant factors in tackling underachievement.</P>
      <P>Equally, increased attention in revised senior cycle curricula to differentiation of syllabus material at ordinary level and higher level and consequentially the use of different examination instruments should also prove significant.</P>
      <P>A research project entitled Do Schools Differ? was undertaken by the Education and Social Research Institute for the Department of Education and Science. It explored the impact of schooling factors on a range of pupil outcomes at junior and leaving certificate level. This research confirms the different levels of examination performance by gender and also indicates that females make greater progress relative to their initial ability. Girls apply themselves better to homework and study and have higher educational aspirations. Nevertheless, the report shows that girls tend to have a lower sense of control of their lives, to report higher stress levels and to have lower self-esteem. In response the Department has initiated a number of personal development programmes for both sexes to address self-esteem among lower ability pupils in order to integrate them more fully into the education process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the request of the equality committee in my Department, the equality studies department in UCD has been engaged since 1998 in a detailed two phase quantitative analysis of performance of <Col N="702" /> boys and girls in the junior certificate examinations, for the period 1992-96, in all subjects but with particular reference to mathematics. The study will be completed in July 2001 and will include policy recommendations. I await the outcome of this study.</P>
    <P>A common feature of under-achievement is early school leaving, particularly by boys, before and after the junior certificate. The national development plan includes funding of £75 million for a school completion initiative to address this issue. The eight to 15 years early school leavers initiative and the stay at school retention initiative target those pupils most at risk of early school leaving and educational failure. In this context, it is significant that boys are more likely than girls to leave school before the end of their second level education. These interventions, together with improved access to the junior certificate schools programme and leaving certificate applied programme, are part of the strategy to tackle low achievement and, in particular, low achievement by boys.</P>

      <P>The majority of teaching posts at second level are filled on a permanent whole-time basis. Vacancies in schools arising from career breaks, approved leave of absence or secondments and concessionary posts, which are allocated in excess of a school's normal quota of posts, may only be filled in a temporary or part-time capacity. In addition, in order to ensure that schools have the flexibility to meet the curricular needs of their students, particularly in minority subject areas, it is necessary for them to appoint temporary or part-time teachers. The number of temporary whole-time posts is approximately 1,600.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the eligible part-time teacher scheme, EPTs who are fully qualified and have given satisfactory service are re-employed on a contract basis from year to year where the same teaching hours are required. Most teachers who are initially employed as EPTs subsequently apply for and are appointed to permanent teaching posts in their subject area. They are entitled to incremental and pension credit for their qualified EPT service, together with recognition of this service for promotion purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken over the past number of years to address job security of temporary teachers. The PCW agreement on the pay and conditions of teachers provided for the conversion of posts from temporary to permanent status and for an increase in the number of <Col N="703" /> allocated posts which school authorities may fill on a permanent basis. The agreement also provided for the establishment of a qualifications committee to determine suitable qualifications for appointments to permanent teaching posts in vocational preparation and training courses. Recently this committee agreed qualifications and experience requirements in the areas of beauty therapy, hairdressing, veterinary studies and arts administration. This will enable teachers with these qualifications to be appointed in a fully qualified capacity and apply for suitable permanent posts. The work of this committee is continuing.</P>
    <P>The Irish language requirement has been removed for the generality of teaching posts at second level. This has enabled teachers who were previously regarded as ineligible to apply for temporary or permanent teaching posts.</P>
    <P>A review of the EPT scheme for VEC teachers has recently been carried out and improved arrangements in regard to EPT contracts have been agreed. vocational education committees now have the option of allocating EPT hours over more than one school and EPTs whose hours fall below the threshold of 11 hours per week required for a contract will be offered any residual hours which may be available.</P>
    <P>The job security of temporary teachers depends on the number and type of posts available. In this regard the position at second level has significantly improved in recent years. In 1999, 225 additional posts were created. In the current school year 1,000 additional posts were created and a further 400 new posts will be created over the next two years in accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>The early start pre-school pilot project is in place in 40 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage. The project is aimed at children who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their potential and are aged between three and four years. It is a one year pre-formal schooling intervention. All children are eligible to enrol in primary education in September following their fourth birthday. At present there are no plans to amend the age entry requirements for the project.</P>
      <P>My Department supports pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in primary schools through a number of measures. These include the home-school-community liaison scheme, support teacher project, breaking the cycle pilot project and the new programme entitled Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
      <P>Under the new programme, selected schools receive additional teaching resources and funding to be targeted at the children most in need of support. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to this programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported where necessary over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, which means from infants to second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, which means third class to sixth class. All schools selected receive additional funding for the delivery of targeted in-school and out of school actions.</P>
      <P>The measures outlined assist children from disadvantaged backgrounds in participating fully in education and realising their potential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Adult Education entitled Learning for Life sets out a range of recommendations to promote and expand access to adult education in the context of a continuum of educational opportunities on a lifelong basis. The recommendations cover the principles which should underpin the service, implementation of a national adult literacy strategy, expansion of part-time options in further education through a back <Col N="705" /> to education initiative, improved opportunities for adult participation in third level education, the enhancement of supporting services such as guidance, counselling and child care, and the establishment of a national adult learning council and local adult learning boards for improved co-ordination, integration and planning, nationally and locally. The recommendations will be implemented on a phased basis in the light of the resources provided in the national development plan and in the Estimates.</P>
      <P>In relation to people with learning disabilities, the paper sets out a range of recommendations regarding the integration of people with disabilities into adult and continuing education, principally related to disability awareness training, cultural relevance, dialogue with disability interests, sharing of best practice and the provision of additional supports such as adaptive technology and care assistance. The paper also recommends that the national adult learning council should employ an access officer to promote and develop this area, and should establish an advisory committee to report on the integration of people with physical and learning disabilities into adult education and to monitor progress in this area.</P>
      <P>In relation to specialist provision, the recent re-organisation of services in this area was designed to ensure that FÁS would assume responsibility for advice, guidance, and training services in relation to vocational-employment skills at a variety of levels, and that the health boards would continue to provide advice, guidance and services in regard to rehabilitative type foundation and life skills training which is pre-vocational in nature and community workshops or other sheltered or supported work options. My Department also funds the delivery of tuition in literacy and numeracy to persons attending a network of vocational training centres operated by the health authorities.</P>
      <P>The National Adult Literacy Agency published guidelines in 1999 regarding provision of adult literacy for people with learning disabilities. The guidelines centre on targeting, staff development, linkages with disability agencies and practical skills to be developed. A range of adult and community basic education programmes is provided by vocational education committees, working with disability groups and agencies, funded through the adult literacy and community education budget.</P>
      <P>A recent study carried out by the Association of Higher Education Access and Disability showed that of the 850 students in third level education identified as having a disability more than half, or 463, were identified as having a specific learning difficulty or neurological difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 10% quota limiting access by people with disabilities to the vocational training opportunity scheme was removed in 1998 and some 8% of all participants in VTOS are persons in receipt of a disability payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. However, provision in the adult education area is under <Col N="706" /> developed and it is intended that the issue will be progressed further in the context of the implementation of the White Paper strategy.</P>
    <P>Children with disabilities in the four to 18 age group have access to a range of special support services. Where the disabilities are of a more serious nature the children can be catered for in a range of special schools, each of which is dedicated to a particular disability group. Such children can also be catered for in special classes attached to ordinary schools.</P>
    <P>Children with less serious needs can be catered for in ordinary classes on an integrated basis with the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with disabilities in primary schools now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. As a result of this decision the number of resource teachers supporting children with disabilities in primary schools has grown from 104 in October 1998 to almost 800 and the number of special needs assistants supporting children with special needs in primary schools has grown from less than 300 to almost 1,800.</P>
    <P>These developments represent an unprecedented improvement in the support available to children with disabilities in primary schools and additional resources are being deployed on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of 301 pupils on 30 September 1999 warranted a staffing of a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers for the current school year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment declined to 299 pupils on 30 September 2000 and accordingly, the staffing warranted for the 2001-02 school year is a principal and ten mainstream class teachers. The number of pupils required to retain the 11th mainstream class teacher for the 2001-02 school year is 300. The school also has the services of a language support teacher and a special class teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In <Col N="707" /> such cases an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by my Department if the school meets the defined criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am anxious to have the school programme completed for all students, the examination process cannot be used as a basis for compensation for loss of tuition time. The integrity of the examination process is based on the preparation of test instruments based on syllabi and marking schemes devised for each test instrument and refined, based on their application to samples of scripts, prior to finalising the marking scheme. The same marking scheme is then applied to all scripts in a particular subject.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that students should be compensated for factors impacting adversely on their studies is raised regularly with the examinations branch of my Department. In any year some students can have their examination preparation interrupted due to illness, bereavement and other traumatic situations. Entire schools can experience short-term interruptions due to adverse weather or heating failure. While I acknowledge that there was widespread disruption this year affecting thousands of pupils it is still the case that there is no objective and fair way of trying to compensate for such events by what would effectively be arbitrary adjustments in the marking process. It is impossible to fairly gauge how any one individual is affected in such situations compared to another. There is actually no safe, credible and equitable way to do what the Deputy is suggesting.</P>
      <P>The only approach is to make every effort to have courses completed by maximising the use of the time remaining before the end of the school year. I am encouraged by reports that schools have been attempting to do that.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Labour Court recommended that any teacher involved in the dispute, who is certified by the school as having contributed in full to the completion of the school programme, be paid £1,750. The ASTI has put this to a ballot of their members and we await the outcome of this ballot.</P>

      <P>A key objective of my Department is to provide school accommodation that is of the highest standard so as to ensure suitable and safe teaching and learning environments.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the Department's extensive construction programme is carried out in line with best international practice, Ireland is an active member of the programme on educational building within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The PEB promotes the international exchange of ideas, information, research and experience in all aspects of educational building. The overriding concerns of the programme are to ensure that the maximum educational benefit is obtained from past and future investment in educational buildings and equipment and that building stock is planned and managed in the most efficient way. As many as 18 OECD member countries and nine associate members participate in the PEB which has a mandate to advise and report on educational facilities for students of all ages.</P>
      <P>The PEB is currently producing its second compendium of exemplary educational facilities. The second edition is intended to showcase a selection of quality facilities which exemplify the aims of PEB. From a total of 56 projects, Ireland has four projects included in the compendium. This is a very significant achievement reflecting as it does the extent to which Irish educational facilities match international standards.</P>
      <P>This Government is attending to historic deficits in educational infrastructure as evidenced by the substantial increases in capital expenditure at all sectors since taking office. In the current year, some £222 million is available for expending on schools infrastructure. This is 3.5 times more than the 1996 allocation and indicates our firm commitment to providing quality school accommodation countrywide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is a falling enrolment at second level it is not possible to quantify the fin<Col N="710" /> ancial savings involved because in recent years my Department has provided significant increases in existing funding and has also introduced new funding arrangements in some areas.</P>
      <P>For example, I am pleased to report that the quality of the second level infrastructure has been significantly improved over the past three years through a programme of sustained capital investment. As much as £112 million was expended on capital projects in 2000. For the current year I have secured from Government an unprecedented £125 million for investment in second level infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In relation to school funding, schools are benefiting from further increases in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year bringing the standard <i>per capita</i> grant over £200 for the first time. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have introduced the schools services support fund. This is a new initiative under which schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year.</P>
      <P>Schools have also benefited under the IT 2000 initiative. By the end of 2000 £41 million will have been allocated to second level schools under the initiative.</P>
      <P>In relation to teaching allocations, subject specialisation, retirement patterns and limited redeployment capacity effectively negate the impact of falling enrolments.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 over 1,200 additional teaching posts have been allocated at second level. As a result of this increase in resources: All second level schools have an entitlement to an ex quota allocation in respect of remedial education; all designated disadvantaged schools have been invited to participate in the home-school-community liaison scheme; the minimum allocation in respect of guidance has been raised; additional teaching resources have been allocated to schools offering the leaving certificate applied and/or the junior certificate schools programme; teachers who would otherwise have been liable for redeployment have been retained in their schools; and the pupil-teacher ratio for appointment purposes has been reduced from 19:1 to 18:1.</P>
      <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. This has arisen because of two main factors. This Government has increased demand for teachers generally by the creation of 2,315 posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratios and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage and the number of trained teachers graduating from our training colleges has fallen to a very low level. For example, only 291 graduated in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate these difficulties. The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-00 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,000 student teachers again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further post-graduate course commenced in February this year with an intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280.</P>
      <P>The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic years. In addition negotiations are taking place with the colleges of education for the provision of a further post-graduate course next year.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from our colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. Bachelor of Education graduates from St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level, as an academic subject, as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998 all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year, teachers, employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the Higher Diploma in Education, are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained <Col N="712" /> teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes, without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification, is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I invited Mr. Seán Cromien, former secretary of the Department of Finance, to conduct a review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs. I initiated this review with a view to ensuring the most effective functioning of my Department in the interests of the Irish education system as a whole. Mr. Cromien's report makes concrete and wide-ranging recommendations for change.</P>
      <P>To advance the change agenda, I established a high level departmental task force to prepare a blueprint for implementation. This task force has now presented a range of proposals and an implementation framework.</P>
      <P>These proposals include consideration of the organisation and operation of the State examinations based on the conclusions in Mr. Cromien's report.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering these proposals and I expect to be in a position to put a proposal on the matter to Government soon.</P>

      <P>It is my policy to support the provision of all-Irish school facilities at primary and second level in areas outside the Gaeltacht regions, where a demand for such provision is demonstrated and where no alternative exists within a reasonable distance.</P>
      <P>At second level there are usually three options that can be explored for the purpose of providing all-Irish facilities in a given area. These options are: The provision of a new school on a greenfield site, the provision of a new school in surplus accommodation in an existing second level school and the establishment of a unit within an existing second level school.</P>
      <P>There are currently seven schools, four secondary and three VEC schools providing all-Irish post-primary education in Dublin. Five of these schools are situated on the southside of Dublin and two on the northside. Up to recently these schools have been catering adequately for demand.</P>
      <P>Arising from increased all-Irish provision at primary level in Dublin in recent years there is now an increased demand for corresponding provision at second level. In response to this demand I recently approved the provision of an additional all-Irish post-primary school on Dublin's northside, Coláiste Lán-Ghaeilge Gráinseach, to cater for the particular demands for all-Irish education at second level in that area. The school, which will operate under the aegis of the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, will be located in vacant accommodation in Grange Community College. It will have a separate board of management and staff. I am pleased to say that the school is due to open next September. I thank the board and management of Grange Community College for their co-operation in making this important development possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor the position generally in Dublin in the light of demographic and enrolment trends and the capacity of existing all-Irish facilities to meet demand. Where a need for additional provision at second level is established, I will take steps to respond to such demand.</P>

      <P>My Department had agreed in principle to fund the provision of a PE hall of 608 m at this school to cater for a long-term enrolment of 500 pupils.</P>
      <P>In line with the current procedure, the school authorities were given sanction in February 2000 to appoint a design team from a shortlist compiled from the Department's approved list of consultants. This appointment was made in June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently the school authorities asked that an overall assessment of the school's accommodation requirements be carried out and that the PE hall project be put on hold for the time being. In light of this request the planning section of my Department reviewed the school's long-term enrolments and forwarded the outcome of this <Col N="716" /> review to the school authorities for their observations and acceptance. The school has since responded and its case for a higher enrolment projection is currently under consideration. A decision will be reached shortly on this matter and the school will be notified of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Once the long-term enrolment figure has been determined the next step will be for the school to complete an educational worksheet based on this figure. This will enable my Department's senior inspector to complete a schedule of accommodation, reflecting the school's curricular needs. The schedule, in turn, will provide the basis to enable architectural planning to proceed.</P>
    <P>In addition, the school authorities have applied for grant aid toward the cost of the replacement of windows and a condition report and tenders are currently being considered by the technical staff of my Department's planning and building unit. A decision will be made in due course and the outcome will be conveyed to the school authorities.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern parents have in this area.</P>
      <P>A substantial amount of inservice training for teachers is provided outside of school time. It is not possible to provide in this way the core training and development for teachers necessary to facilitate the introduction of new and revised curricula and school programmes and other changes in schools. In the absence of dedicated days for such training and development, there is no feasible alternative at present to provision during school time. Every effort is made to keep difficulties for parents to a minimum. A similar situation arises in the case of parent-teacher meetings.</P>
      <P>Various solutions to the difficulties in question are under consideration in my Department on an ongoing basis, including the option of providing inservice activities as part of core training and development outside of normal school times. This matter is complex and I admit to having no practical answers. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to try to find ways to minimise disruption in consultation with the interested parties.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service is the executive agency of my Department with devolved responsibility for the provision of educational psychological services to primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>NEPS has a general remit to promote mental health in schools. In this context psychologists may assist schools in drafting a school policy on responding to traumatic incidents within the framework of school development planning. While all schools do not yet have access to NEPS, in cases of traumatic incidents NEPS responds to all requests for help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NEPS, in partnership with the school and local community services, also has a role to play when a school experiences a tragic event. This can include participation in the assessment of the significance and impact of the event and assistance to the staff in drawing up a plan of action. The <Col N="719" /> psychologists may also offer to meet staff and parents and may engage in the short-term counselling of students. NEPS psychologists act in collaboration with the health boards, especially over the arrangement of long-term support for particular individuals.</P>

Employee assistance officers who have specific training in dealing with traumatic incidents are available to assist teachers and schools in such circumstances.

Decisions on the further development and expansion of this service beyond September 2002 will be made in the light of a review and evaluation of the interim scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools, including insurance costs. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from £45 per pupil in 1997 to £75.50 per pupil in this school year. In addition a rate of £80 per pupil will apply in the 2001/2002 school year. This constitutes an increase of some 77% over that period.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes at primary level. One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum, £20 per pupil in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from Janu<Col N="720" /> ary 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. These improvements mean that for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and has further increased this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of the community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>

      <Quest>the number of primary and post-primary schools which have libraries; his views on the importance of well stocked libraries in achieving good literacy standards; and his proposals to improve the current provision.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to proper library facilities and resources. There is evidence from both international and national studies of reading literacy of an association between having large school libraries and pupils' average achievement scores. In other words, students in those countries and schools that have relatively large school libraries tend to do better than students in those countries and schools where this is not the case. It is important that schools are equipped with a large and varied selection of books and other literacy materials to encourage students to develop the habit of reading for pleasure and for independent learning.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have details of the number of schools with library facilities. At post-primary level it provides a library of 100m in schools with an enrolment of between 200 and 499 students while it provides 136m of accommodation for a library in schools with more than 500 students. Schools below 200 are examined individually. At primary level the design guidelines for schools provide for a library-general resource area. These guidelines are applied to all new school developments and, where possible, in cases of major refurbishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> In addition, in recent years two major grants, involving a total expenditure of some £13 million, have issued to primary and post-primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 per school and schools designated as disadvantaged received £3,170 each. The grant issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to £2,500 and disadvantaged schools received £5,320.</P>
    <P>A second grant was issued to all primary and post-primary schools in December 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant primary schools received a payment of £7.70 per pupil and a minimum grant of £462 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or less. Post-primary schools also received £7.70 per pupil and a minimum grant of £1,540 was paid to all schools with less than 200 recognised pupils.</P>
    <P>At primary level the total value of these two grants was approximately £7.7 million and at second level the two grants amounted to £5.2 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to issuing grants to schools, my Department also issued comprehensive guidelines to schools on the types of resources that the grant money could be used to purchase. At primary level these guidelines took the form of a publication called Book Choice &ndash; Guidelines for Primary Schools which issued in early 1999 and Departmental circular 35/99 which issued in December 1999. At post-primary level Departmental circular M16/99 &ndash; Guidelines for Reading at Second Level was issued to schools in May 1999 and Departmental circular M51/99 was issued in December 1999.</P>
    <P>These guidelines make it clear that the grants were intended to assist schools in developing their library resource materials. The publication entitled Book Choice encouraged schools to liaise with the public library service when purchasing books for school libraries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational needs of pupils with dyslexia of primary school age are generally capable of being met within the mainstream school system with the support, where necessary, of the remedial teacher service or the resource teacher service. There are currently 1,480 remedial teachers and more than 750 full-time or part-time resource teachers in place in the primary system.</P>
      <P>For some children the severity of the condition can be such as to require placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. At present there are four special schools and 19 special classes dedicated to children with dyslexia. Funding is also provided to meet any special equipment needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>At second level pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the severity of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations. In December 2000 I announced a highly innovative nationwide pilot scheme to assist second level students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. As many as 31 schools around the country will participate in the pilot project costing £2 million. Each student with dyslexia will be provided with a laptop computer and specially designed software for school and home use.</P>
      <P>In addition to funding the in-school support services, my Department supports the work of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland in providing classes for children with dyslexia outside of school hours. An annual funding allocation of £58,600 is made to the association to support this work.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, I established a special task force on dyslexia to examine the adequacy of current educational responses to children with dyslexia and to make recommendations considered necessary for the further improvement of services in this area. The task force has now completed its detailed deliberations and is currently finalising its report. It expects to be in a position to present its report before the end of this month. I am confident that its report will provide a valuable input into the further development of education services in this important area.</P>

      <P>The recent audit of all second level schools, conducted on behalf of my Department by the National Centre for Guidance in Education, shows that a significant number of schools are not fully utilising the resources currently being made available to them by my Department for guidance. It also shows that in many schools the service is not adequately targeted at pupils at risk.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances my first priority is to ensure that the resources made available to schools for guidance are fully utilised for that purpose. In line with the Government's priority to promote social inclusion, my other priority is to ensure that those young people who are most at risk of dropping out of education early are a major focus of guidance provision in schools. As a result, any future enhancement of provision to individual schools will be conditional on their making a commitment to providing a service to all their pupils which would reflect both Government priorities and their pupils' needs.</P>
      <P>Recently I announced that 50 additional guidance posts are to be allocated to schools for use by them in developing innovative ways of enhancing their guidance provision, especially in promoting links between schools and business. Schools will shortly be invited to propose innovative actions they would undertake in order to enhance their guidance provision and that posts will be allocated on the basis of an objective assessment of these proposals.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>In relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000/01 was higher than the reference value which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>Similarly, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000/2001 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999 and this was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. In September 2000 I established an action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and, as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced, last September, the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grantholders which was targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: between £1,775 and £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and between £710 and £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports, to ensure <Col N="725" /> their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Commission on the Points System recommends that the points system be retained on the basis that it is well established, is broadly fair and transparent and is generally accepted by the public at large. Nonetheless, the report identified a number of weaknesses and drawbacks in the current system and makes recommendations on a wide range of issues including lifelong learning, access to third level education for mature students, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and students with disabilities, entry to healthcare courses and the leaving certificate grading and points system.</P>
      <P>On the question of access to third level education, I appointed an action group last September, chaired by Dr. Cormac MacNamara, to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second chance students. The group was asked to consider the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in this area. I have now received the report of the action group. At present I am considering the recommendations and hope to be in a position to make an initial response in the near future.</P>
      <P>Following careful consideration of the recommendation that the bonus marks for answering through Irish in the leaving certificate be abolished, I have decided to retain the present system of awarding bonus marks. In taking this decision I took account of the wider issues of public policy towards the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the relevant statutory provisions, many of the recommendations in the report fall within the responsibility of third level institutions themselves. The Higher Education Authority is pursuing these recommendations with the relevant institutions and will report to me as soon as possible. My Department has also requested the Higher Education Authority to <Col N="726" /> establish a committee to explore the issue of introducing a preliminary third level course in life sciences as a prerequisite for entry into the healthcare courses.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the funding arrangements for our schools, including insurance, have evolved in a manner that reflects the sectoral division of our second level system. In the case of voluntary secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita</i> grants may be used for this purpose.</P>

    <P>The recommendations made by the Blackstock Group for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under continuing review. The Blackstock Group identified a number of <Col N="727" /> policy options in relation to school insurance. However the group did not provide estimates of the costs involved in these options.</P>
    <P>Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements, including insurance, for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools in the light of available resources.</P>

    <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. Discussions on the staffing of schools with the partners in education will continue to be held annually.</P>
    <P>The projected increase in enrolments will impact on the demand for primary teachers and my Department will take cognisance of the projections in discussions with the colleges of education in determining the intake of students.</P>

    <P>The figures have risen from 1,222 or just under 2% of the total cohort in 1995-96 to 4,250 or 7.3% of the total cohort in the present school year. While I do not believe the leaving certificate applied is being taken, as yet, by the full number of students who could benefit from it, the fact that figures have more than tripled since the inception of the programme is very heartening. Efforts are being made by my Department and by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in a variety of ways to increase participation in this excellent programme. These <Col N="729" /> include additional teaching supports, the continued work of the eight person support service in schools, the constant adaptation of the programme to make it more student friendly and the recent launch of a promotional video.</P>
    <P>Overall evidence indicates that the leaving certificate applied is impacting positively on retention rates. There is little doubt that in the absence of the programme many students taking it would fail to complete senior cycle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department makes a specific ex quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance in second level schools. The allocation ranges from 0.36 of a post or eight hours per week in schools in the free education scheme with an enrolment of less than 200 pupils to two posts in the case of schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. In the case of certain fee paying schools which are not in the free education scheme 0.5 of a post is allocated in respect of these schools in the 350 to 499 enrolment category and a full post is allocated in the case of schools with 500 or more pupils.</P>
      <P>Recently I announced that 50 additional guidance posts are to be allocated to schools for use by them in developing innovative ways of enhancing their guidance provision, especially in promoting links between schools and business. Schools will shortly be invited to propose innovative actions they would undertake in order to enhance their guidance provision. Posts will be allocated on the basis of an objective assessment of these proposals.</P>
      <P>An expert group is currently reviewing the current procedures for the allocation of teachers at second level. I expect to receive the group's report shortly.</P>

      <P>In September 1999 the remedial teaching service was extended to all primary schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil-teacher ratios were advised that they could seek remedial support where they could demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
      <P>There are two primary schools in County Galway which do not currently have a remedial teacher service. The schools in question are Lurga NS, Gort and Scoil Náisiúnta Naomh Columba, Inishturk, Renvyle. Both of these schools have a pupil-teacher ratio of less than 10:1.</P>
      <P>Resource teacher support is provided to address the needs of children with disabilities who are attending primary schools on a fully integrated basis. The support may take the form of a full-time teacher allocation or an allocation of part-time hours. The level of support provided in any individual situation is determined by the professionally assessed needs of the pupil or pupils involved.</P>
      <P>At present there are 54 full-time resource teachers serving 162 primary schools in County Galway. In addition, a further 44 primary schools in the county have been allocated part-time hours support.</P>
      <P>The following is a list of those schools currently in receipt of resource teacher support in County Galway: </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report was sent to all schools and is, I am sure, a valuable resource for school authorities in this area.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically, this can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances my Department endeavours, through a process of consultation with the schools involving the inspectorate, to assist in the re-instatement of the pupil in the school or, alternatively, his-her placement in another school. In more difficult situations the national educational psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs, with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these measures provide protections for students, I have, in addition, brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act to address general issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board with responsibility for monitoring school attend<Col N="735" /> ance on a countrywide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second level schools. The Act will require schools to report suspensions that last at least six days to their local educational welfare officer. Schools will also be required to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any student. In such instances the role of the educational welfare officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to try and identify a mutually agreeable solution to provide for the education of the student concerned. The automatic involvement of the educational welfare officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school.</P>

      <Quest>the circumstances of paid leave for teachers; if he has considered granting an entitlement to teachers to a paid sabbatical after a set number of years teaching; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Paid leave for teachers is a conditions of service issue which would normally be raised at the Teachers' Conciliation Council.</P>
      <P>Subject to certain conditions teachers are paid while on approved leave, including sick leave, maternity leave, bereavement leave, <i>force majeure</i> leave, marriage leave, study leave and examination leave or while absent representing Ireland in international sporting events. Teachers may also be paid while on jury service, while attending court as a defendant in a case in which the school is directly involved or as a witness under subpoena or summons. Teachers who are members of public bodies, for example, county councils or statutory local bodies, are allowed paid leave up to a maximum of ten days in a school year to enable them attend meetings of those bodies.</P>
      <P>My Department may agree to the secondment of a teacher from his or her post to another position within or outside the education sector. The teacher would continue to receive salary while on secondment. The secondment, if approved, would be subject to the prior agreement of the teacher's employer and to appropriate arrangements being made for the recoupment to my Department of the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision for paid sabbatical leave for teachers. There are job-sharing and career break schemes in operation to facilitate teachers wishing to reduce their number of weekly teaching hours or to take a break from their teaching posts. In the case of job-sharing, teachers are required to teach for half of the standard weekly hours and receive half their full-time salary in <Col N="736" /> respect of it. Teachers are not paid while on career break.</P>

      <P>Following the publication of this document, my Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment undertook a process of consultation in relation to the future shape of the junior certificate.

      <P>At present there are no proposals to provide conversion courses designed for long-term temporary and substitute teachers in primary schools who are untrained and do not possess a basic degree.</P>
      <P>As a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers, my Department requested the colleges of education to provide post-graduate courses to enable degree holders train as primary teachers. The duration of the post-graduate full-time course is 18 months. These courses were provided in the 1995-96, 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 academic years. Another course commenced in February of this year and negotiations are taking place with the Colleges of Education to provide a further course next year. Persons who hold a primary degree may apply for admission to this post-graduate course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temporary and substitute teachers who are paid at the unqualified rate are paid holiday entitlements in accordance with the terms of the relevant legislation. These persons may be entitled to disability or sickness benefit from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs if they meet the relevant criteria.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently there are five projects under the aegis of my Department that are covered by the term youth encounter project. Each has a board of management that is responsible for the implementation of policy on discipline in the project. These projects, which are non-residential, can accommodate up to 115 young persons aged between ten and 15 years both boys and girls. These young people have either become involved in minor delinquency or are at risk of becoming involved in delinquency and have become alienated from the mainstream school system.</P>
      <P>The evidence available from school reports furnished by my Department's inspectorate indicates clearly that these special national schools make good educational provision for this category of pupil. Students are taught a range of subjects and some students pursue a limited number of subjects for the junior certificate examination and junior certificate schools programme. The main emphasis is on developing the literacy, numeracy and life skills of the students in small classes in a caring and supportive setting.</P>
      <P>This year my Department will contract an external agency to carry out an evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of all non-mainstream education projects for children at risk that are currently being funded by the Department. This evaluation will include the five youth encounter projects and other similar projects. The outcome of the evaluation will inform future policy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boards of management of all schools have responsibility for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing <Col N="739" /> with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
    <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline.

      <P>Following a Government decision in May 2000 approval was given for the establishment of a national maritime college in Ringaskiddy, County Cork using the public private partnership model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national maritime college will accommodate the Department of Nautical Studies of the Cork Institute of Technology and the Naval Col<Col N="741" /> lege of the Irish Naval Service. Planning for the provision of the college is well under way in my Department. Management consultants have been appointed to support my Department's public private partnership unit with the procurement of the project and an application for outline planning permission for the new college was submitted by the Cork Institute of Technology to Cork County Council in September 2000.</P>
    <P>A project board has been established comprising representatives of my Department's public private partnership and planning and building units, Cork Institute of Technology, the Naval Service and the management consultants to oversee the implementation of the project. A prior information notice was published in March to ascertain the level of interest in the market and the project notice was dispatched to the Official Journal of the European Communities on 6 April 2001. The project was also advertised in Irish newspapers on 11 April.</P>
    <P>Although at this stage it is not possible to give the Deputy a detailed timetable for the project it is anticipated that, following the EU tender process, the new national maritime college will be available for use in the last quarter of 2003.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the findings of a recent survey which found that early school leavers were not benefiting as much as others from the economic boom and that, in particular, many employers were prejudiced against early school leavers; the particular plans he has to address the job needs of early school leavers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent ESRI report entitled Issues in the Employment of Early School Leavers shows that in the past two years only 20.7% of firms surveyed employed early school leavers who had not attained their leaving certificate. For those who did not do so, or 31%, the major reason given was that they were simply not recruiting and 14.3% of firms said that they had received no applications from early school leavers. A lack of education or skills was cited less frequently. In addition, employers who had engaged early school leavers showed that they rated them as good or average in terms of honesty, reliability, time keeping, teamwork and ability to fit in or have personal skills, for basic ability which could be built upon, and for following instructions. In this survey early school leavers scored lower for computer literacy, having participated in pre-employment training and initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key objective in educational policy is to optimise participation in school to completion of upper second level education. A range of targeted initiatives are in place to achieve this. They range <Col N="742" /> between additional teaching and financial supports for schools in disadvantaged areas, a key emphasis on school planning and the development of community and inter-agency links, curricular reforms to widen choice and increase relevance and staff development programmes.</P>
    <P>For those who leave school with no qualifications or less than five Ds at junior cycle, Youthreach provides an intensive programme of integrated general education, vocational training and work experience. Following a major expansion of the programme in 1998 some 7,000 places are provided between FÁS and the vocational education committees. This is supplemented by a guidance counselling and psychological service and by a child care measure, both of which were introduced for the first time in 1998. A survey of Youthreach participants who completed programmes in 2000 shows that 76.2% progressed to employment of which 53.8% came from further education and 22.4% came from training. Youthreach centres operate referral networks which link education and training providers with FÁS, welfare and employment, health and probation services and with employers. New technology and work experience are a mandatory part of the programme.</P>
    <P>At present Youthreach operates on a full-time basis and caters for early school leavers who are unemployed. The need for such young people to continue their education and training after entering work has been recognised and the back to education initiative proposed in the White Paper on Adult Education: Learning for Life, and provided for in the national development plan, will provide for a major expansion of part-time learning options across the further education sector.</P>
    <P>Work in this area will be further strengthened with the establishment of an educational welfare service under the Education Welfare Act, 2000. The service will play a key role in supporting children at risk to remain in school and will support early leavers in the 16 to 18 age group who leave school to enter work to continue their education and training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The analysis of supply of and demand for second level teachers is complex. Previous analyses indicate that regional and subject variations combine to distort the national picture. Schools in certain locations report more difficulties in recruitment while specific subjects may pose particular difficulties. These findings are <Col N="743" /> confirmed by last year's ASTI survey entitled Survey of School Principals on Difficulties recruiting Qualified Teachers in Second Level Schools. The position is further complicated by the fact that vacancies in second level schools usually require specific subject combinations.</P>
      <P>While principals have reported difficulties in recruitment in certain areas, my Department is not aware of any second level school that has not filled its approved teacher allocation for the current year.</P>
      <P>In response to concerns regarding the adequacy of supply and following analysis of various factors, the intake quota to the higher diploma in education was increased from 800 in 1997-98 to 1,000 in 1999/00, representing an increase of 25% in two years. The quota of 1,000 places also applied this year and will apply again for the coming academic year.</P>
      <P>Previous analyses undertaken for my Department showed that the extent of shortages reported by school principals varied by subject. A survey of principals who recruited for the 1996-97 school year found that reported shortages were greatest in Irish, 34% of respondents who recruited, followed by home economics at 13% and religion at 8%. The more recent ASTI survey also found variations between subjects with principals reporting most difficulties in respect of Irish at 35%, French at 17% and home economics at 15%.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the position on supply and demand for second level teachers has been, and will remain, the subject of ongoing review by my Department in consultation with the Higher Education Authority and the universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular: the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and the possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of school bags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommend<Col N="744" /> ations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy school bags.</P>
    <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report with an accompanying circular to all primary and post-primary schools. Information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department will be examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. The report further recommended that, in relation to second level schools, my Department should continue to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is one of a variety of supports provided my Department in order to meet the needs of students who are having difficulties in school. Many of the NEPS psychologists have relevant experience and training in the area of emotional and behavioural disorders, and programmes of professional development on behavioural management are also made available to them in order to develop their skills further.</P>
      <P>NEPS psychologists work in partnership with parents and teachers in order to meet the needs of students with behavioural problems. Their interventions may include individual psychological assessment, classroom observation, and assistance to staff and parents in drawing up action plans. The psychologists may, in certain cases, engage in short-term counselling of students. However, counselling interventions and programmes of behavioural management are usually most effectively carried out by those who have day-to-day contact with the students, namely teachers and parents. In second level schools, guidance counsellors have a particular role to play in this area, while, at primary level, support teachers and home-school-community liaison teachers also help to support young people with difficulties. When particular students and families seem to need more intensive, long-term intervention, NEPS refers them to the appropriate health board or community agencies.</P>
      <P>NEPS also has a general remit to promote mental health in schools. In this context, psychologists may assist schools to draft policy and procedures for responding to particular types of behavioural problem, for example, bullying and truancy.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to the development of the NEPS agency in order to provide a swift response to students who are experiencing problems. A programme of recruitment to the agency is well under way and will continue until the overall target of 200 psychologists nation-wide has been achieved.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that my Department is participating in the Government's programme on public private partnerships &ndash; PPP &ndash; and specifically in the pilot programme of infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>I believe that PPPs have significant potential in relation to developing new ideas on school design which arise from the output-based approach, testing value for money over the lifecycle of the projects, making better use of educational facilities outside of school hours, allowing educationalists to concentrate on their core functions and optimising allocation of risk in areas such as planning, design, construction, maintenance and operation of facilities.</P>
      <P>To date, my Department has included three projects in the Government's PPP pilot programme. These are the Cork School of Music, five new post-primary schools in Ballincollig, Clones, Dunmanway, Shannon and Tubbercurry which are grouped as one project, and the proposed National Maritime College, Ringaskiddy, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an EU tendering process, I announced the selection of a preferred bidder for the Cork School of Music and the post-primary schools project, on 27 March last. The schools are <Col N="747" /> due for completion in September 2002, and the Cork School of Music in September 2003.</P>
    <P>A project notice for the National Maritime College was dispatched to the Official Journal of the European Communities, OJEC, on 6 April 2001 and the project was also advertised in Irish national newspapers on the 11 April. It is anticipated that the college will be available for use in the last quarter of 2003.</P>
    <P>All of the above projects are being developed on a design, build, finance and operate basis. The educational management of all three facilities will remain with the existing education authorities.</P>

      <P>My Department has approved a syllabus for social, personal and health education at junior cycle in second level schools; the syllabus was prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. It is planned to phase in social, personal and health education at junior cycle level over a three year period which began in September 2000. There are 259 schools providing the SPHE from September 2000.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being put in place to develop a social, personal and health education curriculum for senior cycle by the NCCA. The work at senior cycle will follow on from work already done at junior cycle.</P>
      <P>Significant elements of social, personal and health education are already being offered in up to 70% of post-primary schools through the relationships and sexuality programme, the substance abuse prevention programme and the health promoting schools programme.</P>
      <P>To date, 1,635 teachers in 522 schools have participated in a 50-hour training course under the On My Own Two Feet programme. More than 40% of post-primary schools have implemented the RSE programme.</P>
      <P>A major programme of in-career development for the teachers who will be involved in social, personal and health education at second level started in autumn 2000; this is a joint initiative between my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</P>
      <P>Social, personal and health education has been assigned one class period per week in schools which does not necessitate extra teacher allocation. While social, personal and health education is not a core subject at present, the position is being kept under ongoing review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Health and Children commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon and associates to undertake a workforce planning study on therapists, including occupational and speech and language therapists. This study follows the final report of the expert group on various health professions which was established by the Minister for Health and Children in accordance with Labour Court <Col N="750" /> Recommendation 15515. The Higher Education Authority is represented on the steering group for the study and I understand the report is expected in the near future.</P>
      <P>As an interim response to the shortage of occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, arrangements were made to increase the number of places offered on the relevant programmes at Trinity College, Dublin for the current academic year to 35 in the case of occupational therapy and to 29 in the case of speech and language therapy. At my Department's request, the Higher Education Authority has been exploring options for further increases and has been in touch with the Department of Health and Children regarding related issues including the question of clinical placements. Further discussions will be necessary on completion of the workforce planning study.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to social work training places is that the intake to the relevant courses in Trinity College, Dublin and University College, Dublin was increased in October 1995. This increased intake has been maintained and a new degree course aimed at mature students was introduced by the National University of Ireland, Cork with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year. The report of the National Social Work Qualifications Board of July 2000 provides baseline information on social work posts in Ireland, based on a survey of the position as at 1 September 1999. The survey found there were not enough qualified social workers available to fill posts and that an increase in the number of graduates from professional social work courses would be required in order to meet future demand.</P>
      <P>My Department has held discussions with both the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority regarding the possibility of expanding the output of qualified social workers to meet the identified shortfall in social work graduates. The report outlines how any increase in training places is intrinsically linked to practice placement opportunities. Quality practice placements are at the core of social work training and constitute some 50% of course time. The report notes that there is a crisis in supply of practice placements due to a lack of formalised structures and resources. I understand that officials of the Department of Health and Children have been pursuing this issue.</P>
      <P>Proposals for increasing the intake into the relevant courses at University College, Dublin, University College, Cork and Trinity College, Dublin for the next academic year are currently being considered by the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to liaise with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, in order to ensure an adequate supply of speech therapists, occupational therapists and social workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of assessing the need for new educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area involves consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and existing school provision serving the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process, my Department monitors county development plans and area action plans and meets with local authorities as required to establish the location, scale and pace of major housing developments. An assessment is carried out of the likely implications of such developments in relation to the capacity of any existing schools and, where appropriate, the local authority is requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, <Col N="753" /> or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity where necessary. Liaison with existing schools is important also and these would normally alert my Department where the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</P>
    <P>In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a long-term need for primary or post-primary educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. Temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs.</P>
    <P>Where it is necessary to develop a greenfield school, my Department usually acquires the site from the land owner, although the option is available for patrons to do so should they so wish.</P>
    <P>The issue of patronage may be determined in a number of ways. Historically, schools at primary and post-primary level were predominantly denominational in character and privately owned. The development of a network of second level schools under the aegis of vocational education committees and, more recently, the emergence of all-Irish and multi-denominational primary schools under State ownership, have added to the variety of patronage and trusteeship arrangements.</P>
    <P>Where my Department has established the need for new primary school provision and the matter has not been the subject of an application by local promoters, the case would be taken up with established patron bodies to determine their intentions in that regard. At second level, the options available are a community school, a community college and a voluntary secondary school. Generally, the model chosen in each case would be determined following local consultation.</P>

      <Quest>if he proposes carrying out a review of the method under which schools were classified as disadvantaged in 1996; and if schools which did not qualify for disadvantaged status in 1996 can be re-examined with a view to being designated in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, primary schools were selected on the basis of priority of need as reflected by reference to a range of socio-economic criteria, for example, unemployment levels, medical card holding, and local authority housing occupancy among the families of pupils. In 1996, 16 schools were included in the disadvantaged areas scheme by virtue of the fact that they were associated with <Col N="754" /> schools that had been selected for inclusion in the scheme in previous years.</P>
      <P>It has been found that the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level is inflexible and does not take account of different levels of need. The scheme has generally focused on schools in larger urban areas, while neglecting smaller but serious pockets of disadvantage in schools in medium sized towns around the country.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive survey of all primary schools was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000, at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. A number of accepted socio-economic variables were used to compute an index of educational disadvantage for each school surveyed. These variables included unemployment, medical card possession and residence in local authority housing which have been found in the past to be valid indicators of educational disadvantage at school level. Separate indices were used for rural and urban schools to reflect the findings of previous research that showed that educational disadvantage manifests itself differently in urban and rural settings. Participating schools were ranked in order according to the prevalence of pupils enrolled, who had background characteristics associated with educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. The survey outcome forms the basis of the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, a major initiative which I launched in January last to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level over a three year period. Under the new programme, it is now proposed to refine our approach to ensure that the individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. The new programme subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>All of the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme. Over 2,300 primary schools will benefit under the new programme, based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the ERC survey. This involves an overall cost of £26 million including the allocation of over 200 additional teaching posts over the three years of the new programme.</P>
      <P>Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, the Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the schools participating in the new programme are being allocated additional resources to be used to provide targeted in-school and after-school services for specific children at risk. Schools that were previously designated as disad<Col N="755" /> vantaged will retain the resources that had been allocated to them and may also qualify for additional resources under the new programme, based on the level of concentration of pupils at risk.</P>
    <P>The new programme will be subject to independent evaluation to ensure that the programme is meeting its objectives and to assist in its future development and the introduction of further interventions in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, all students in second level schools take a three-year junior cycle programme. Students may then take a one-year transition year programme, followed by a two-year leaving certificate programme, or may proceed directly to a two-year leaving certificate programme, comprising the established leaving certificate or the leaving certificate vocational programme or the leaving certificate applied. At present, the transition year programme is offered by approximately two-thirds of all second level schools.</P>
      <P>The present positioning of the transition year programme gives students space to mature at a key stage in their compulsory schooling, to enhance their study skills in order to make them more autonomous learners in their future studies, and to receive a reflective introduction to the world of work. The other transition points in second level students' lives are the transfer from primary to second level school and the transfer from second level school to the workforce or to third level study. Students in their first year of attendance at second level schools would not be ready for the kind of experiences that the transition year as currently positioned can offer. The development of the whole person that can be achieved by a good transition year programme could not be achieved at that stage. If the transition year programme was offered at the point of entry to third level study or to the workforce, students might not be willing to stay in school for the extra year. The experiences gained in transition year could not influence their approach to subject choice or their study habits for the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>The format, structure and content of both the curriculum in its totality and individual subject syllabi are matters which are kept under review by my Department and the NCCA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding of schools at both primary and second level is structured on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants towards services such as caretaking and secretarial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has placed a high priority on increasing funding to schools. Recent developments at primary level include significant improvement in the level of capitation grants. I increased the standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools from £45 per pupil to £75.50 in <Col N="757" /> the current school year, and a rate of £80 will apply in the 2001-02 school year. At second level, I increased the <i>per capita</i> grant by £8 from September last and I will further increase the grant by £10 to £202 for the next school year. In addition, schools with disadvantaged status receive further capitation of £30 per pupil per year, bringing the overall <i>per capita</i> payment in respect of such pupils to £232. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. In my view this is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives.</P>
    <P>At primary level, in addition to the funding improvements outlined above, substantial progress has been made in providing additional supports to schools. The measures introduced to date include: the introduction of the scheme of release time for teaching principals with paid substitution cover for the 2000-01 school year; the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools with an enrolment of 180 pupils and Gaelscoileanna with an enrolment of 158 pupils on 30 September 2000 in the 2001-02 school year; the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools where there are ten or more teachers including <i>ex quota</i> posts.</P>
    <P>Arising from the PCW agreement on teachers' pay and conditions, middle management in second level schools has been improved through the creation of significant numbers of additional posts of responsibility. In addition, over the past two years, in excess of 1,200 new teaching posts have been created at second level.</P>
    <P>This Government has demonstrated a clear commitment to improving the resourcing of schools at all levels and I intend to build on this in the future.</P>

The league has recently written to me about it, given my responsibility for the Credit Union Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The current position is that our officials, together with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and officials from the Department of Finance, are considering different aspects of the matter and are in discussion with representatives of the league. If it becomes clear that the particular financial limit referred to is a significant obstacle to participation by the credit union movement, in the Government's SSIA initiative I will give consideration to amending it, having satisfied myself that to do so would not cause other difficulties regarding the preservation of the special character of credit unions.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons.</P>
      <P>I am aware of campaigns against slavery and bonded labour. In particular, I have welcomed Trócaire's initiative to highlight the issue of contemporary forms of slavery as their Lenten campaign this year and I supported the aims of the campaign. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, has met representatives of Trócaire to discuss the campaign and ways in which the Government can support it.</P>
      <P>Slavery and human rights issues in general are normally considered by the UN bodies which have a specific role and expertise in this area, notably the Commission on Human Rights, which concluded its fifty-seventh session in Geneva last week, and the International Labour Organisation &ndash; ILO.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, has also met representatives of Trócaire to discuss bonded labour and has undertaken to take into account the issues raised in making our national preparations for the ILO annual conference in June 2001.</P>
      <P>The protection and promotion of the rights of all human beings is the first responsibility of every government. The persistence of contemporary forms of slavery, a most fundamental abuse of human rights, presents a challenge to all governments. Highlighting and addressing this issue, with the assistance of organisations like Trócaire, is a priority for the Government.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> The existing legislative framework for the sector is largely based on European law and was designed to facilitate the full liberalisation of the sector and the introduction of competition. In the light of technological, market and competitive developments, this framework needs to adapt to these changes. Five new draft directives, which will facilitate an enhanced and adaptive response to the needs of the rapidly developing electronic communications markets, are currently under negotiation within the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. My Department is actively involved in these negotiations. It is anticipated that the draft directives will be agreed in 2001 and transposed into Irish law as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>In parallel with these EU reforms, legislation is currently being prepared by my Department, which will enable a better match between the regulatory framework and evolving market needs, including the requirement to facilitate and manage competition. The general scheme of the Communications (Regulation) Bill was approved by the Government in March 2001 and has now been sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. It is available for perusal on my Department's website, at www.dpe.ie. Drafting will be completed over the coming months and the Bill will then be resubmitted for Government approval to publish as the Communications (Regulation) Bill, 2001. It is my intention to seek priority in the drafting of the Bill and to publish it this summer.</P>
    <P>Competition in the mobile market will be further enhanced by a competition for four third generation mobile licences due to be held by the director later this year. In order to promote competition at both the infrastructure and service levels, the selection process for one of the proposed licences will include a weighting in favour of allowing access to mobile virtual network operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>No disposal of mortars took place last year. The decommissioning of old mortars took place in 1999. The mortars, 200 in all, were purchased from Brandt, France in the period 1936 to 1955.</P>
      <P>On the recommendation of a military board of survey, the mortars were converted to scrap in Clancy Barracks in Dublin. The scrapped mortars were removed to the Irish Steel plant, ISPAT, in Haulbowline in October 1999 for reprocessing.</P>
      <P>When the scrapped mortars arrived in the Irish Steel plant, the radiation detection alarm on the premises was activated. Irish Steel, as required by law, alerted the Radiological Protection Institute, RPII, and the scrap was not accepted.</P>
      <P>A technical expert from the RPII was requested to investigate the source and extent of the radiation and to advise on procedures. He identified the source of the radiation as the radionuclides, Radium 226 and Radium 228. The radium is found in the luminous strip on the cross levelling bubble located on the bipod of the mortar. It is understood that wristwatches have also been luminised with similar radioactive material.</P>
      <P>The task of isolating those cut mortar bipod sections which were radioactive was undertaken by ordnance personnel on 19 October 1999. All personnel involved were adequately protected using disposal overalls, face masks, gloves and personal dosimeters. The isolated segments were returned to Clancy Barracks. The isolated radioactive segments are stored in steel bins in Clancy Barracks wherein all radioactive emissions are contained. The remaining non-radioactive scrap was handed over to Irish Steel for reprocessing.</P>
      <P>It is mandatory for the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces to maintain a register or inventory of all radioactive substances and to be licensed by the RPII. The Department and the Defence Forces meet all the requirements of the RPII in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the leading Army hearing loss case of <i>Hanley,</i> which was delivered in December 1999, my Department in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office and in consultation with the Law Society of Ireland, established an early settlement scheme, ESS, for dealing with the outstanding Army hearing loss litigation claims. The scheme operated successfully on a pilot basis during 2000 and 1,098 claims were settled by way of direct negotiations between solicitors representing plaintiffs and officials of the Chief State Solicitor's office and my Department.</P>
      <P>Given the success of the pilot scheme, my Department expanded the ESS in January of this year. In this regard, five firms of liability loss adjusters have been engaged in order to expand the capacity of the scheme and to augment the resources of the Chief State Solicitor's office in conducting settlement negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme has continued to operate successfully and the current position is that by 31 March <Col N="766" /> 2001, a further 325 claims had been resolved, while I understand that settlements have been agreed with plaintiffs' solicitors in a further 350 cases. In addition, negotiations are ongoing or due to commence in a further 1,350 claims.</P>
    <P>In relation to costs, by 31 March 2001, a total of 1,423 claims had been settled under the scheme at a cost of £9.5 million in compensation. Legal costs amounting to an additional £4.46 million has been paid in 1,366 of those claims. Significantly, this latter figure represents savings of the order of 50% of plaintiffs legal costs by comparison with claims which proceed to court.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the early settlement scheme, legal claims were adjourned in the High Court in Dublin on three occasions during 2000. Claims were also adjourned in the High Courts in Kilkenny, Limerick and Dundalk during the Easter term 2000. In 2001, further adjournments have been granted in the Dublin High Court from 2 February to 8 May. Army hearing loss claims will be listed by the court for a two weeks period, from 8 May to 18 May, and for the first four weeks of the Trinity term that is, from 13 June until 11 July. The court is to then consider the question of adjournments during the Michaelmas term at the end of July.</P>
    <P>During the periods of the adjournments, the resources of my Department and the Chief State Solicitor's office, augmented by the loss adjusters, have been dedicated to settling as many claims as is feasible under the early settlement scheme. In this regard, it is the policy of my Department to resolve the vast majority of outstanding claims under the scheme. The scheme has now reached a stage where many hundreds of plaintiffs throughout the country have had their claims resolved at fair levels of compensation, with significant savings to the exchequer in court costs. I am hopeful that the early settlement scheme will continue to operate successfully and that the vast majority of the outstanding claims will be resolved in this way.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> Arising from the temporary provision of accommodation for asylum seekers, the cost of security at Magee Barracks, Kildare is now being met by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North-Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and no further costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to that property. Clancy Barracks has not yet been vacated and therefore no security costs have been incurred in respect of that property.</P>
    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty allowances alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to almost £870,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £147,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>
    <P>The legal formalities of sales agreed in respect of Fermoy, Naas and Castleblayney are being progressed at present. Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, will be placed on the market when Cork County Council complete their deliberations on the integrated action area plan commissioned for that property. Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated in the near future and will be offered for sale shortly. In view of the need for accommodation for asylum seekers, it has not been possible to arrange for the disposal of Magee Barracks, Kildare, however, this matter is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>Tax relief can be claimed on a MED1 form for the cost of the supply, maintenance or repair of any medical, surgical, dental or nursing appliance used on the advice of a practitioner.

If a practitioner advises that a patient requires, for medical reasons, an appliance such as a stair lift or a personal pendant monitoring alarm, tax relief may be claimed on the cost of supply and the annual maintenance charge of the appliance.</P>
      <P>Most non-routine medical and dental expenses including such items as the cost of doctors' visits, maintenance or treatment in a hospital, transport by ambulance, specialised dental treatment and certain items prescribed by a doctor, qualify for relief. Routine dental and ophthalmic expenses do not, however, qualify.</P>
      <P>The Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order, 1981, administered by the Revenue Commissioners provides for refunds of VAT in respect of certain qualifying goods for use by disabled people. Under this order, it is possible to get a refund of VAT on the purchase of personal alarms by or on behalf of a disabled or elderly person normally used as medical alert systems and which are triggered by a pendant when worn by the person concerned. It may also be possible to obtain relief from VAT on a stair lift. Applicants should contact Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayments (unregistered section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>

      <P>It is the preferred wish of the majority of dependent older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, and this can often be achieved by providing financial assistance to informal family carers together with some service provision by the health agencies where needed. In these circumstances, not only are family preferences acknowledged but it is accepted that there is a saving to the Exchequer, especially in cases where institutional care would otherwise have to be provided. It is very hard to quantify such saving but one must bear in mind the cost of the carer's allowance of £108 million this year and the provision by the health boards of specific assistance to carers. In this latter regard, a minimum of £4 million additional funding was provided to the health boards over the last three years in respect of specific assistance to carers. Older people living at home also benefit from the range of community-based services, which were boosted by additional funding of approximately £11 million allocated over the past three years to the health boards.</P>

      <P>When the GMS scheme was introduced in 1972 it was a fee per item based scheme. However, following a review of the operation of the scheme in the mid-1980s the basic payment structure changed to an age and sex based capitation system, which also encompasses a superannuation element. It is an annual figure. General practitioners hold GMS contracts with the health boards for the provision of services to medical card patients. Extra premia are payable to doctors for out of hours services and for domicili<Col N="773" /> ary visits. The medical card holder does not have to make any payment for these services. There are also a range of specific payments for particular services that co-exist with this capitation structure. Entitlements and arrangements in respect of pension and holidays are as per the provisions of the GMS contract.</P>
      <P>The GMS scheme comes about as a result of negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation which is the only body representing general practitioners to hold a negotiation licence. Agreements arising from these negotiations are translated into official Department circulars setting out the terms of the agreements for implementation at health board level. Full details of the general medical services contract are set out on the website: www.gpit.ie/egms.</P>
      <P>Practice support allowances in the form of grants for secretarial or practice nurses are also based on the number of GMS patients on a doctor's panel. They are not intended to be the basis of the salary paid to the individuals involved. These salaries are a matter of contract between the doctor, as the employer and his or her employee.</P>
      <P>My Department intends, through the HSEA, to enter into negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation very shortly on the matter of the budget provision and the extension of the medical card to all persons aged 70 years and over. It is hoped that this will ensure that all procedures are in place to facilitate the implementation of the measure from 1 July, 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable developments have taken place in cancer care and treatment since the commencement of the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997. To date more than £60 million has been invested in developing cancer services. One of the major elements of the implementation of the strategy was the introduction of a national breast screening programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme was launched in October 2000. Phase <Col N="774" /> 1 of the programme has commenced in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas and offers free mammography to women aged between 50 and 64 years living in those areas.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck currently has two static units and one mobile unit. The static units are based on the campus of the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and on the campus of St. Vincent's University Hospital. Currently one mobile screening unit operates at a local level in country areas covered by the programme. An additional mobile screening unit will come on line this summer. Each unit is a screening facility independent of the hospitals until a diagnosis of cancer is made or admission is required. The programme is staffed by a multidisciplinary team of radiologists, radiographers, pathologists, nurses and surgeons.</P>
    <P>In the period of January to March 2001 approximately 2,700 women per month were screened at the BreastCheck units, with 1,100 of these screened at the Eccles Unit on the campus of the Mater Hospital. In the same period approximately 700 women per month were screened on the mobile unit. Less than 1% of those screened are admitted to hospital for further management.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the timely treatment of screen detected lesions BreastCheck has secured one all-day operating theatre per static unit, and four to six in-patient hospital beds per affiliated hospital have been earmarked for the treatment of these patients. These range from one-day to seven-day beds.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular case mentioned by the Deputy, I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the person mentioned was scheduled to be admitted to St. Vincent's ward, Mater Hospital on 16 April and, at her request, was deferred to 17 April. Unfortunately, due to clinical need it was not possible to admit the patient on 17 April but she was admitted on 26 April for her treatment.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the issues relating to the nursing home subvention scheme raised in the report by the Ombudsman are currently being examined in my Department. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report and the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. In this regard, it would be premature to speculate on what the additional costs of the scheme might be.</P>
    <P>However, this Government is aware of the implications for the provision of health services presented by the change in demographics. Since coming into office in 1997 this Government has allocated significant resources to services for older people, particularly health services, in an attempt to deal with this change and the resulting issues, which will emerge. Additional funding for the development of health services for older people has increased significantly from £10 million in 1997 to an additional £36 million in 2000, while in 2001 an additional £57.427 million will be provided.</P>
    <P>A total of £2 billion has been made available by this Government for investment in the health services under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which represents a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. Of this £2 billion, approximately £200 million, will be available for the capital development of the full range of services for older people. A broad range of facilities will either be provided, replaced or upgraded as a result, including assessment and rehabilitation facilities, ambulatory care facilities, community hospitals, community nursing units, convalescent and respite beds, daycare centres and services for the elderly mentally infirm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the working party of services for the elderly entitled, The Years Ahead &ndash; A Policy for the Elderly, was published in 1988. The principal recommendations of the report which still guide the development of services were as follows: to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home; to restore to independence at home those older people who have become ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies in every way possible; and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, The National Council on Ageing and Older People undertook a review of the implementation of the recommendations contained in The Years Ahead. Their report identified a number of areas where progress on implementation had been less than adequate. This was due, in the <Col N="777" /> main, to lack of investment of resources in services for older people in the early and mid-90s. However, since coming into office, this Government has provided significant additional funding to this area of the health services and the objectives outlined in The Years Ahead are moving closer to fruition.</P>
    <P>I should add that the ideas or model suggested in the original report still hold good to a very large extent and will be encompassed in the section dealing with services for older people in this Department's upcoming new health strategy.</P>

      <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991, health boards have statutory responsibility for the care and protection of children including following up on reports of child sexual abuse. Health boards do not routinely submit reports dealing with individual cases of child abuse to my Department. However, all health boards provide statistical information for incorporation in the Department's interim minimum dataset and the most recent information from the South Eastern Health Board, which relates to 1999, indicates that there were 2,204 cases of child abuse reported to the health board, with the breakdown as to types of abuse as follows:</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Ballinasloe regional water supply scheme. This scheme was fourth on the list of water schemes submitted by Galway County Council in 1999 in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessment. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced in July 2000. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time. The scheme is fifth in the council's revised priority list of water schemes received in my Department last January.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to a project known as the farm village. My Department has received a submission in relation to this proposal. Essentially what is proposed is a rural clustered housing development in the countryside which would be situated within a working organic farm or a farm in conversion to organic status. The submission to my Department requested that guidelines be issued to planning authorities requiring the &ldquo;Farm Village&rdquo; to be designated as a category of development open to consideration for permission in areas zoned as agricultural in their development plans.</P>
      <P>The settlement strategy of most rural development plans is to limit development in the open countryside and promote smaller towns and villages. My Department supports this policy <i>inter alia</i> through the town and village renewal programme. The need to develop the smaller towns and villages is a specific policy set out in the Government's White Paper on rural development. My Department would, of course, be generally supportive of any innovative proposals for sustainable forms of development. This proposal is at an early stage of development and therefore it would not be appropriate to issue any national guidelines at this stage. It would appear that the best way forward in this case would be for the promoter of this project to identify a suitable location for a pilot development of this type and to pursue the matter directly with the relevant planning authority.</P>

    <P>It must be emphasised that while these numbers are classified as homeless there is no suggestion that they are all sleeping rough on the streets. Some are in hostels, some are in bed and breakfast accommodation and some are staying with parents or friends.</P>
    <P>Hostel accommodation is the main source of accommodation for homeless persons. The description &ldquo;hostel accommodation&rdquo; is a broad one and includes long-term, transitional or medium-term accommodation where people can stay for varying periods and over-night accommodation which may be vacated during the daytime although in some cases the same persons might come back nightly.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 900 bed places available for homeless people in hostels in the Dublin City area.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure across the different EU member states. However, as well as encompassing social welfare expenditure, social protection expenditure, as defined by Eurostat, also covers expenditure in other areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes, e.g. certain FÁS programmes and other social exclusion programmes. This is clearly a very different definition to &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; as is understood in this country and for this reason it is not possible to provide the comparative data requested.</P>
      <P>The latest year for which comparative data on social protection expenditure has been published by Eurostat is 1998, and so it does not take into account the very substantial increases in social welfare payments which the Government introduced in 1999 and 2000. Neither, of course, does it take account of the record social welfare increases which have been introduced this year.</P>
      <P>Table 1 sets out the comparative data on social protection expenditure, published by Eurostat for the years 1990 to 1998.</P>
      <P>In making any comparisons, a number of important points must be taken into account &ndash; firstly, we have a relatively young population compared to most of our EU neighbours. Not alone does this mean our pension costs are lower, but we also have lower costs on health care and caring generally.</P>
      <P>Second, while occupational pensions and benefits play an important role in the overall social protection system in Ireland, information on the significant amount of expenditure involved is not currently available for Ireland. Accordingly, the figures provided by Eurostat for social protection expenditure seriously understate the actual level of expenditure involved in this country as compared with other EU member states. The Pensions Board in its National Pensions Policy Initiative estimated that expenditure on occupational pensions alone would be in the region of 4% to 5% of GDP.</P>
      <P>Third, the Eurostat figures are based on GDP, but it is recognised that in Ireland GNP, rather than GDP, is the better measure of the income available to society. The figures based on GDP therefore understate the proportion of our income that is spent on social protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fourth, the higher levels of social security expenditure in some countries are financed by <Col N="785" /> considerably higher rates of social security contributions &ndash; in some cases three times higher than the Irish rates. For instance, the current rate of PRSI in Ireland is 18%, as compared with rates ranging between 42% and 48% in Germany, France and Italy and 69.6% in the Netherlands. Any increase in the Irish PRSI rates up to these levels would have significant competitiveness and labour market implications.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Government is also setting aside a portion of the benefits of the current economic success to underpin the future viability of our pensions system. This will ensure the living standards of our older population in the years to come. To this end a National Pensions Reserve Fund has been established. More than <Col N="786" /> £5 billion has already been allocated, with further annual statutory contributions of 1% of GNP going towards the fund.</P>
    <P>This significant investment in social protection is not reflected in the data published by Eurostat. Social welfare expenditure as a proportion of both GDP and GNP over the period from 1990 to 2001 is set out in Table 2. Following increases in the early 1990s, the proportion of GNP-GDP going towards social welfare provision has been declining in recent years, reflecting the country's strong economic performance and the fall in unemployment since the mid 1990s. This is a trend that has been mirrored in many of the other EU member states. However, it is estimated that social welfare expenditure as a percentage of GNP-GDP will increase this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>This most recent estimate of the number of full-time carers has been provided by the results of the census pilot survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office. This survey was carried out in September 1999 and is based on a sample of 8,000 households in which persons aged 15 years or over were asked if they provided unpaid personal help for someone with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age.</P>
      <P>The detailed results are as follows:</P>
      <P>&ndash;35,000 people provide more than 50 hours unpaid personal help per week, or seven hours per day.</P>
      <P>&ndash;17,000 people provide 20-49 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between three and seven hours per day.</P>
      <P>&ndash;79,000 people provide one to 19 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between nine minutes and 2.5 hours per day.</P>
      <P>These results are consistent with the figure of 50,000 full-time carers as estimated in the review of the carer's allowance. It also explains the estimate of 120,000 carers used by the carer organisations which I have consistently said was due to the definition they were using of carer as someone who visits or assists a person but who does not provide full-time care. I have asked the Central Statistics Office to consider using a more detailed breakdown of these hours when conducting the census next year.</P>
      <P>There are almost 17,000 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that almost 33% of the 52,000 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than three hours per day, are in receipt of carer's allowance. This is an increase of almost 84% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office and indeed, it should also be noted that the expected increase of another 5,000 carers following the recent increases in income disregards will increase this percentage to 44% of all carers who are providing more than three hours care per day.</P>
      <P>This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million next year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent budget, in addition to the substantial rate increases of £8 for carers aged under 66 and £10 for carers aged over 66, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial <Col N="788" /> increase from April 2001 in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. This will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment. The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children earning a joint income in the region of £15,100 will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £25,100 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>This means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes and the measures that I have introduced further enhance the qualification criteria for this scheme. In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider that abolition of the means test, at a cost in the region of £180 million, to be the best way to support carers or the best use of resources.</P>
    <P>The income disregards I have introduced already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance. As I announced in my budget speech, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation whereby all carers whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was a new annual respite care grant payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance to use in whatever way they choose. There has been very positive feedback on this payment and with this in mind I also made provision for an increase in the amount of the respite care grant from £300 to £400 and a double respite care grant of £800 for carers who are caring for more than one care recipient. These increases will become effective in June 2001, when the grant is next due, at a full year cost of over £3 million. Increasing the amount of the respite care grant by a further £100 could cost an additional £2.5 million annually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In Budget 2001 the Government announced its intention to increase the qualified adult allowance, QAA, for those aged 66 or over to the same level as the personal rate of the old age (non-contributory) pension, currently £95.50 per week.</P>
      <P>The increase of £15 per week in the QAA announced in the budget is the first step in this process. The measure is intended to improve the position of women who do not qualify for a pension in their own right and is designed to complement administrative individualisation which will allow for direct payments to a qualified adult. Issues surrounding administrative individualisation are currently being examined by a working group set up under the PPF.</P>
      <P>In general, a qualified adult allowance is paid at a lower rate than the personal rate. However, in the case of some reduced rate contributory pensions not including pre-53 or over-56 self employed pensions the QAA is actually being paid at a higher rate than that being paid in respect of the pensioner. In these cases the personal rate is reduced to reflect the average level of contributions paid but the full rate QAA was being paid. The proposals announced in Budget 2001 in relation to the QAA would worsen this anomaly.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I introduced measures in the Social Welfare Act, 2001 to deal with the situation. From April 2001 the QAA payments in all new cases will reflect the rate at which pensions are awarded. For instance, if a person is awarded a pension at half the full personal rate the qualified adult will also be paid at half the full QAA rate.</P>
      <P>These arrangements do not apply to existing cases where the QAA is being paid at a higher rate than the main payment. Instead, it was decided to slow the rate of increase. Accordingly, in these cases, the full QAA increase was not paid, instead, this group received an increase of £8 per week.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of £6 per week, to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone. About one third of those receiving eligible payments are being paid the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 90,000 people resident in Ireland receiving either an old age pension or a widow/er's contributory pension from the UK. While the number of these people who are living alone is not known, based on our experience with those receiving Irish pensions, <Col N="790" /> the cost of paying the living alone allowance to them would be approximately £9.5 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The allowance is an integral part of the Irish pension system which is paid as an additional allowance on our pensions. As such, it has no applicability <i>vis-à-vis</i> pension payments made under the social security regimes of other EU member states or countries with which Ireland has bilateral agreements.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, there are no plans to change or expand the eligibility conditions along the lines suggested.</P>

      <Quest>when the scheme of free electricity units for senior citizens was introduced; if the level of free units has remained static since; and if he will consider increasing the number of units.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The free schemes, including the free electricity allowance scheme, are generally available to people aged 66 years or over, who are living alone and are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free electricity allowance retain that entitlement in order to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlement following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>From October 2000, the free schemes, including the free electricity allowance scheme, were extended to all persons aged 75 and over, regardless of their income and household composition. In addition, provision was made in Budget 2001 to further extend the free schemes to all persons aged 70 years and over from this month.</P>
      <P>The free electricity allowance was introduced in October 1967 and it covered 600 units per annum. In 1972 it was increased to the current 1,500 units each year, 200 units per billing period in the summer and 300 units per billing period in the winter, in addition to the normal standing charges. VAT due on this standard allowance is also covered. The value of the allowance, if fully taken up, is £154.09 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the review of the free schemes, published in April 2000 by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, the issue of increasing the number of electricity units was examined. The review noted that the objective of the allowance is to provide for a basic standard of usage and considered that the major advantage of the allowance is that it is based on a unit allowance and therefore keeps pace with electricity price increases. However, the review noted that the basic standard of electricity usage has increased over the years due to the growth in electrical appliance use. Therefore, <Col N="791" /> despite the inflation-proof nature of the allowance, it is not now as valuable as it was in the past. Accordingly, the review proposes that the allowance be increased to maintain its overall value to the recipient.</P>
    <P>This recommendation, which has expenditure implications, will be examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines in the form of a Government decision taken in March 1993 were issued to all Departments. The Government decided that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to State bodies under their aegis. The Government further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice.</P>
      <P>These guidelines were extended in March 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature etc.</P>
      <P>Each Minister is responsible for implementation of the Government's gender balance policy in his/her own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Government decision in March 1993, my Department undertook to monitor the position on a quarterly basis with a view to enhancing gender balance. Quarterly returns are submitted by each Department showing the gen<Col N="792" /> der composition of the State boards under that Department's aegis.</P>
    <P>The figures for membership of State boards on 31 December 2000 show that 28% of the total serving membership were women. This figure needs to be broken down between persons nominated by Ministers and those nominated by others. In the case of Ministerial nominees, 34% were women. In the case of nominees by other bodies, 21% were women. Women comprised 18% of chairs of boards.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that more progress is made towards reaching the 40% target. My Department is reviewing the matter at present and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Cabinet shortly.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women took place in 1995 and agreed the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.</P>
      <P>The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action signalled a commitment on the part of governments to international norms in gender equality, to the elimination of discrimination against women and to the removal of obstacles to equality for women. Ireland accepted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action without reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform published a report at the end of 1996 on the implementation of the Platform for Action, including strategies for future action. In January 2000, my Department drew up a national report in response to a UN questionnaire to govern<Col N="796" /> ments, reviewing implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, in preparation for the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly &ldquo;Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the Twenty first Century&rdquo;. Ireland's report instanced numerous examples of successful policies, programmes and projects as well as highlighting commitments to further action or new initiatives. For example, major pieces of rights-based legislation have been passed in Ireland in the last five years. These include the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000. Other noteworthy achievements included progress in addressing women in poverty through the introduction of strategies such as the national anti-poverty strategy introduced in 1997 and through substantial increases in child benefit and increases in State pension payments. Progress in relation to child care included provision of funding in the national development plan of £344 million over the period 2000-2006 for the development of child care. The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, which gives effect to the EU Joint Action on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Exploitation of Children, has a positive effect on the girl child, which is one of the critical areas of concern identified in the Beijing Platform for Action.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently working on the development of a National Plan for Women, 2001-2005, which will be drawn up under the same priority actions or critical areas of concern as defined in the Beijing Platform for Action. Consultancy expertise has been engaged by my Department to assist in drawing up the draft plan.</P>
    <P>Finalisation of the national plan for women will involve a consultation process which will be as comprehensive and wide-ranging as possible. It is hoped to involve a large number of women's representative groups and other NGOs, the social partners, other stakeholders, women generally and Government Departments and other statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>My Department is considering the details of the consultation process at present and will build on the experience gained through other consultation processes, such as those relating to the national children's strategy and the white paper supporting voluntary activity. It is envisaged that the consultation process will be completed by October, with a view to finalisation of the plan by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has informed me that flunitrazepam, the active ingredient in rohypnol, has been classified as a schedule 3 controlled drug in Ireland since 1993. rohypnol, which is a benzodiazepine, may only be obtained on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner and unauthorised possession is an offence. The company which manufactures rohypnol has placed a purple coloured dye in the product, making it difficult for someone to &ldquo;spike&rdquo; another person's drink without this being noticed. A committee has been established to review the position regarding all benzodiazepines and is preparing a report on benzodiazepines, which should be finalised by the end of June, 2001.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following seizures of Flunitrazepam, Rohypnol, were made during the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, provisional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with a recommendation in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, a monitoring committee was set up to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in that report.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee held its first meeting on 3 March 1994 and met on the following occasions in the years 1995-1997: 19 June 1995; 27 June 1995; 27 February 1996; 22 April 1996 and 22 April 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the overlap between the issues dealt with by the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Beijing Platform for Action, the remit of the monitoring committee was expanded and the name of the committee was changed to the Gender Equality Monitoring Committee. The Gender Equality Monitoring Committee met on the following occasions in the years 1997-1998: 10 June 1997; 21 July 1997; 7 October 1997; 30 October 1997; 17 November 1997; 16 December <Col N="798" /> 1997; 20 January 1998; 12 February 1998; 12 November 1998 and 10 December 1998.</P>
    <P>The Gender Equality Monitoring Committee considered that research should be commissioned, <i>inter alia</i>, into the development of mechanisms to monitor progress in achieving gender equality in Ireland and decided at its meeting of 12 November 1998 to establish a sub-committee to commission and oversee this research. It was decided that the research project would include recommendations on how to implement outstanding areas of the Second Commission on the Status of Women. The project would also include proposals for monitoring outstanding recommendations and for changing the monitoring process. As the sub-committee would oversee the research project it was decided at the meeting of 10 December 1998, that the Gender Equality Monitoring Committee should meet when the research was completed.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee met on a total of five occasions between November 1998 and November 1999 and reported back to the Gender Equality Monitoring Committee on 26 November, 1999.</P>
    <P>The Gender Equality Monitoring Committee met again on 11 January 2000. The sub-committee then met on six occasions between March, and October 2000.</P>
    <P>Much had been achieved by the Gender Equality Monitoring Committee over the years. Three monitoring reports had been published &ndash; one in 1994, a second in 1996 and the third in 1999. These reports monitored the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women, indicating where progress was made and where obstacles to implementation occurred. However, the committee considered that the time had come to move forward into the future with a new agenda. The committee considered that the most efficient way to move forward was to draw up a national plan for women which would take up from the work of the Second Commission on the Status of Women. New monitoring structures would be required for the national plan for women and the research would identify mechanisms to monitor progress in achieving gender equality. Accordingly, the Gender Equality Monitoring Committee held its final meeting on 28 November 2000 where Dr. Yvonne Galligan presented her report on the research, commissioned by the committee, on the development of mechanisms to monitor the achievement of gender equality in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Dr. Galligan's report is due for publication in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of Women made 211 recommendations comprising more than 600 parts.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a recommendation in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, a monitoring committee was set up to monitor the implementation of these recommendations.</P>
      <P>Three monitoring reports were published &ndash; one in 1994, a second in 1996 and the third in 1999. These reports monitored the implementation of the recommendations, indicating where progress was made and where obstacles to implementation occurred.</P>
      <P>In 1999, on the advice of the Gender Equality Monitoring Committee, my Department, commissioned research on the development of mechanisms to monitor progress in achieving gender equality in Ireland, which is due for publication shortly. The terms of reference of the research included assessing the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and making proposals regarding concrete steps towards implementation where recommendations could be implemented.</P>
      <P>The research reviewed the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and concluded that over three quarters of the 211 recommendations were implemented or were on the policy agenda by 1999-2000, that one-fifth were outstanding and that a small number were obsolete. The research highlighted difficulties in assessing implementation of the recommendations. In part, the difficulty was with the generalised nature of many of the recommendations and the large number of reforms sought. A further problem was encountered in measuring the policies produced in response to many of the recommendations as, unless subsequent policies did exactly as the recommendations called for, it was sometimes difficult to evaluate whether policy responses matched the report's recommendations. An additional complexity was that any assessment was subjective, as perceptions as to what constituted substantial as distinct from partial implementation depended on the perspective of the person carrying out the assessment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, progress is ongoing in certain areas covered by the recommendations. For example, substantial progress is being made in relation to childcare including the allocation of very substantial funding, amounting to £344 million over the period 2000-2006 and further work remains to be done over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the assessment of the position regarding the implementation of the recommendations, including a list of those considered to be still outstanding, will be available on publication of the research and this will provide an opportunity for relevant Departments to devise strategies, where appropriate, for implementation. The research recommends that a national plan for women be developed to replace the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women as <Col N="800" /> the framework for Ireland's gender equality agenda and that this plan should take the outstanding recommendations of the Second Commission's report into account.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently working on the development of a draft national plan for women, 2001-05.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responses in relation to the issue of violence against women falls within the remit of a number of Government Departments. The Deputy will also be aware that the report of the task force on violence against women contained a number of recommendations for measures to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the recommendations contained in this report the Deputy will be aware that the Government established a national steering committee on violence against women and appointed Ms Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as its chair.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, which contains representatives of the governmental and non-governmental organisations working in relation to this issue, has achieved the bringing together of the many organisations and services with the aim of providing a cohesive, multi-disciplinary and multi-agency response to victims of violence.</P>
      <P>Eight regional committees on violence against women, again representative of the governmental and non-governmental organisations active in this area, have also been established and these committees are working at a local level in this respect.</P>
      <P>Progress in relation to the report's recommendations is, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, in view of the complexities of the issue and the multiplicity of service providers involved, at various levels and stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Noticeable progress has been made in relation to the development of local networks, the development of public awareness campaigns, the production of a national directory of services for women experiencing violence and the increase in the budget for this work. In this regard the Deputy might like to note that this year the amount being allocated by my colleague Deputy Martin, the Minister for Health and Children, for the provision of services to victims of domestic violence, rape and sexual assault has increased to £8.3 million, a signifi<Col N="801" /> cant increase on the original allocation of £3 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition, the regional committees are working on the development of protocols for use by the service providers, both community and statutory. They are also developing their existing service response and identifying gaps in service delivery. Much of the work, as I understand, is being carried out by the voluntary and community sectors and this work is aided by the increases in funding, which will enable them to respond effectively to the demands placed on them. To facilitate the exchange of information and ideas the Minister of State has established a forum, comprising the designated officers and chairpersons of the regional committees.</P>
    <P>Research commissioned in relation to issues such as the attrition rate in sexual assault offences cases and the development of a single crisis referral helpline have highlighted areas where work needs to be progressed and, in some cases, where new initiatives need to be developed. The national steering committee is also in the process of commissioning research into a needs analysis, which will aim to identify how much progress has been achieved, what remains to be done and also how the user views the services in place.</P>

    <P>The Deputy has also asked for details of the funding allocated under each of the categories outlined above. Table 2 details the level of funding committed to date per county under these three headings.</P>
    <P>Table 3 provides details of the draw down of <Col N="803" /> funding by the project promoters for the period up to 30 March 2001. In the case of capital grant applications, the difference between the amounts committed and the amounts paid out reflects the fact that payments are made in stages as work progresses. In many cases, building contractors are unable to begin work on projects as soon as had been expected due to other work commitments. In the case of staffing support applications to community-based not-for-profit groups, the <Col N="804" /> difference between the amounts committed and the amounts drawn down reflects the fact that the grants are allocated over a three year period and the requirements placed on groups in relation to recruitment procedures. I have been informed by my Department's equal opportunties childcare section that there will be a marked increase in the actual expenditure by the end of the next quarter. Funding has also been drawn down to date by projects approved funding under the quality improvement category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The listing of cases and case management is a judicial function. As the Judiciary are independent under the Constitution the Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in this regard.</P>
      <P>While there are circumstances in which the establishment of what might be called &ldquo;dedicated courts&rdquo; might be warranted, I believe that the real problem here is not the absence of a dedicated court, but one of general delay in the Central Criminal Court and at a number of Circuit Court venues.</P>
      <P>These delays affect cases involving child victims as well as adult victims of serious crime. This is a matter of concern and I have taken action, within my area of responsibility as Minister, to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I obtained Government approval for the appointment of an additional High Court judge who took up duty in February of last year. I also ensured that all the vacancies on the High Court Bench which arose in the course of last year were filled. These actions ensured that the court had the maximum statutory number of judges available. I have also recently published the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001, which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a further increase by one in the statutory number of High Court judges. Furthermore, I obtained Government approval for the appointment of an additional judge of the Circuit Court, and this appointment was made at the end of January last. This will enable the respective presidents  &ndash;  who are, of course, responsible for the listing and allocation of cases &ndash; to address the problem of delays, to the extent that they may <Col N="806" /> be attributable to the shortage of judges. I should add, of course, that delays can be caused for a number of reasons, some of which are outside the control of the court.</P>
    <P>I understand that the President of the High Court, in order to deal with the increase in the number of cases coming before the Central Criminal Court, has increased the number of judges sitting in that court to four, and that consideration is being given to the allocation of a fifth judge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no EU provisions giving an entitlement to either paid or unpaid paternity leave for fathers at the time of the birth of their children or thereafter and there are no plans at present to introduce such an entitlement.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory entitlement to paternity leave at national level at present. However, the Parental Leave Act, 1998 provides an individual and non-transferable entitlement to each parent to 14 weeks' unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The leave is in respect of each child and, in general, it must be taken before the child reaches five years of age. Certain exceptions in relation to age also apply in the case of an adopted child.</P>
      <P>The issue of paternity leave was examined during the course of the recent review of maternity protection legislation conducted by my Department in consultation with the social partners and relevant Government Departments and agencies. The working group, which carried out this review, stated in its report that the group recognises the importance of the role of fathers at the time of and immediately after childbirth. The group, without commitment from any party, agreed that the issue of paternity leave would be considered in the context of the forthcoming review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, or such other review as may be appropriate.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Parental Leave Act provides for a review of its operation not earlier than two years and not later than three years after the commencement of the Act, i.e. between 3 December 2000 and 3 December 2001. This requirement is incorporated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which contains a commitment to carry out this review in 2001 in consultation with the social partners. I announced the commencement of this review on 28 February 2001. A working group comprising the social partners, relevant Government Departments and the Equality Authority has since been established by my Department to review and assess the provisions of the Act in the light of its operation. The issue of paternity leave will be considered in the context of that review. It is not possible at this stage to pre-empt the outcome of the review.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there has been no increase in the number of assaults in Sligo town in the recent past. The incident outlined in the newspaper cutting provided by the Deputy refers to one highly publicised assault which took place on 19 March 2001. I understand that the gardaí are following a definite line of inquiry into this assault. I am also informed that the other two incidents outlined in the correspondence forwarded by the Deputy occurred in 1992 and 1997. In the view of the Garda authorities, public order problems in Sligo are no greater than in any other comparable provincial town.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I announced last November that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nation-wide over the next three years &ndash; as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme. I am happy to say that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Sligo town is being considered in the context of this programme.</P>

To enable my Department to formally approve the grant the club was required to submit the necessary documentation required under the programme. The club must also execute a deed of trust to protect the State interest in the project. This is a requirement in respect of facilities in receipt of grant-aid <Col N="851" /> above a certain threshold, which stood at £39,000 up to and including the 2000 programme.</P>
      <P>The club in question has recently submitted documentation to my Department in relation to the project. This documentation has been forwarded for examination to the Office of Public Works, which acts as technical advisers to my Department in relation to the sports capital programme. As soon as the views and recommendations of the Office of Public Works have been received, the club will be advised of the position.</P>
      <P>The Chief State Solicitor's Office has been requested by my Department to prepare a deed of trust and it will be in contact with the solicitors acting on behalf of the club in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Education Act, 1998, has established a statutory basis for the operation and continuing development of education at primary and post-primary level. The Act clarifies the respective roles of school patrons, boards of management, principals, teachers, parents and the Minister and provides a framework for the development of a supportive and dynamic environment for teachers and school managers. The Act places considerable emphasis on the principle of partnership, whether at local level in management and operation of schools, or at national level in the development of education policy.</P>
      <P>Sections 9 and 15 of the Education Act provide clear legislative statements on the functions that schools and boards of management are obliged to carry out. These functions are wide-ranging but are primarily aimed at ensuring that schools and boards of management provide an appropriate education for all pupils.</P>
      <P>Many of the provisions of the Education Act, including sections 9 and 15, essentially codify and standardise what is already happening within schools. However, this serves an important purpose in providing transparency and clarity as regards the rights and responsibilities of each of the stakeholders, as well as facilitating best practice and the effective and efficient use of resources.</P>
      <P>My Department assists schools and boards of management in carrying out their functions as outlined in these and other sections of the Act by ensuring that adequate financial and teaching resources are available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 October last year, the Government announced a decision in principle to establish a mechanism to provide financial redress to persons who have suffered abuse in residential institutions for which the State had regulatory or supervisory functions. Since that announcement, officials of my Department and the Attorney General's Office have been examining the very complex issues that arise in the establishment of such a mechanism. As part of that process, my Department wrote to the main groups representing victims of abuse, notifying them of the Government's commitment, and inviting them to put forward their views, in writing or in person, as to how such matters should be progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, in February of this year, and taking into account the views expressed to my Department in those submissions and meetings, <Col N="855" /> the Government approved the drafting of legislation to establish a body to undertake this role. The following are the main features of the scheme. It will be a stand alone scheme for <i>ex gratia</i> payments to survivors of abuse. Claims will be accepted from people who allege abuse while they were, as children, resident in an institution in respect of which State bodies had regulatory or supervisory functions. The compensation scheme will accept claims for a period of three years from the establishment date. The compensation awarding body will have as a chairperson a retired or serving senior member of the Judiciary and other members as required. Validation of claims by claimants to the compensation body will be conducted in a non-adversarial way, with inquiries confined to establishing essential facts combined with medical-psychiatric assessment of a claimant. Compensation will be paid for current and continuing damage caused by abuse, and for past damage, from which the claimant has now recovered. The legislation will provide detailed criteria for awards, including the amount of awards for different kinds of abuse and its affects. An independent expert group will be appointed to determine these criteria.</P>
    <P>Since this announcement, officials of my Department have had further discussions with groups representing survivors of abuse to consider the details of this proposed legislation. In all, my officials have met with or received submissions from ten groups representing victims of abuse and the consultations remain ongoing. These consultations will have a direct role in shaping the final legislation produced. It is my intention that, wherever practicable, the views of victims of abuse should be incorporated in the legislation. My Department and the Attorney General's Office have also met with legal representatives of victims of abuse.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that shortly after the Government's announcement in October, the Conference of Religious in Ireland, CORI, acting on behalf of the religious congregations, announced a decision in principle to participate in any scheme prepared by Government, and further announced that that they would make a meaningful contribution to such a scheme. My officials are currently meeting with the representatives of the religious orders, to explore how they might be involved in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The commitments given by this Government in October of last year and February of this year are priorities for this Government. It is, therefore, my intention subject to the discussions being carried out with survivors of abuse, and with the religious congregations, to publish legislation on this issue very shortly. It is further my intention that this legislation be enacted before the summer recess, to allow for the process of redress to commence later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I launched the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, in January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the new programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported where necessary over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes infants through second class and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>All schools participating in the new programme will also receive financial support for the delivery of targeted in-school and out-of-school activities.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £2,431 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned in respect of the current school year. The school in question was considered for additional teaching staff but it was established that the school already has sufficient teaching staff to implement the maximum class size guidelines of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes in respect of the current and forthcoming school year.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has two permanent resource teachers for Travellers. I have asked my Department's inspectorate to review the educational needs of the Traveller pupils in the school.</P>

They also advised the interdepartmental committee which was convened at the request of the Government to consider strategy in relation to the ASTI dispute. An amount of £48,000 plus VAT of £9,840 has been paid in respect of these services for the years 2000 and 2001, up to 25 April 2001.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 180 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 171 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and five mainstream class teachers for the 2001-2002 school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the school has services of a shared learning support teacher. The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by my Department if the school meets the defined criteria.</P>

      <P>Until the end of the year 2000, an educational psychologist employed by my Department in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, provided a psychological service to all post-primary schools in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Following the decision of the Government in 1999 that NEPS should develop a psychological service that would eventually be available to all schools, my Department embarked on a programme of recruitment for NEPS. Thirty-one additional psychologists have been appointed since September 2000.</P>
      <P>This has allowed NEPS to begin the process of expanding the psychological service in the north-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> One of these new NEPS psychologists has now been assigned to work in the region. She has already begun work in a number of post-primary schools, and is now initiating a service to some 17 primary schools in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that when all schools in the county will have access to the NEPS service there will then be seven psychologists serving County Donegal.</P>

The two post-primary schools in Mountbellew, which is three miles from Castleblakeney and shares the same catchment area, have also applied for capital funding. As a direct result of these applications, and in view of the projected long-term enrolment of 750 pupils in <Col N="859" /> the three schools, my Department decided to examine the scope for developing a single school to serve the area.</P>
      <P>Letters issued to the trustees of the three schools inviting them to consider the issue of rationalisation. The trustees have each replied, indicating that their first preference would be that each school should retain its current status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the OECD International Adult Literacy Survey Results for Ireland, published in 1997, showed that 25% of the adult population, representing some 500,000 people, scored at the bottom literacy level. It is important to stress that this was not a survey of illiteracy, but rather of the different levels of skills which are needed for participation in a modern economy. These adults were found to score at the low<Col N="863" /> est level, level one, performing at best tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text, with no distracting information. The survey showed early school leavers, older adults and unemployed people as being most at risk of literacy difficulties, with participation in adult education and training being least likely for those with the poorest skills.</P>
      <P>Since the survey, this Government has given a high priority to developing adult literacy programmes. The adult literacy budget has increased from less than £850,000 prior to 1997 to almost £10.677 million this year. In the period 2000-06 £73.6 million is being provided for a national adult literacy strategy under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>A range of initiatives has been progressed as part of the expansion of the service in co-operation with the vocational education committees, the National Adult Literacy Agency, and training and employment interests. These include measures to support awareness promotion, outreach, the development of referral networks and flexible provision. As a result the numbers availing of the service have increased from 5,000 in 1997 to 17,150 by the end of 2000. A quality framework has been developed and nationally certified in service programmes for staff are being implemented. A directory of adult literacy services has been published to promote awareness of contact points for the service. The first phase of development of an adult guidance service has been initiated, and phase two will begin in mid year in 2001.</P>
      <P>This is being supplemented by radio and television developments so that a mass audience can avail of literacy learning in the privacy of their own homes. A television series &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo; was commissioned and broadcast on RTE from September to December 2000 and attracted an average weekly audience of 155,000, peaking twice at 192,000. The series was repeated again in January and was followed by a more intensive tuition series on radio, which began on 26 March 2001. These initiatives were accompanied by free learner packs available from the National Adult Literacy Agency, allied with a free-phone helpline operated by the agency.</P>
      <P>Videos of the television series are currently being distributed free to literacy schemes, adult learning centres, public libraries and video outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee on literacy for the unemployed has been convened by my Department, which is working with the National Adult Literacy Agency, FÁS, the local employment service, the vocational education committees and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social Community and Family Affairs on the development of an integrated strategy in this area. In that context, a number of joint literacy projects with the FÁS-funded community employment scheme are <Col N="864" /> under way and are now being expanded to all FÁS regions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the school population, there are estimates from both national and international studies that approximately 10% of Irish primary school pupils have serious literacy difficulties. These issues are being addressed through the expansion of the remedial service to all primary and post-primary schools, reforms of the service in line with an expert evaluation, a major investment in the provision of school library books and the work undertaken in the past year by the national reading initiative to promote awareness and enhance quality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of requests by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding. As the Deputy is aware, the funding arrangements for our schools have evolved in a manner that reflects the differ<Col N="867" /> ent traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors.</P>
    <P>I consider that the Blackstock report represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of postprimary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. The recommendations made in the report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under continuing review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels.</P>
    <P>While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    <P>Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bringing greater equity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools in the light of available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has presided over an unprecedented level of improvement in education services for children with special needs, particularly children attending mainstream education.</P>
      <P>Arising from a Government decision in October 1998, all children with special needs in primary schools now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</P>
      <P>As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers supporting special needs children in integrated settings in primary schools has increased from 104 in October 1998, to more than 945 full-time resource teacher equivalents at present. The number of special needs assistants supporting children with special needs in primary schools has increased from less than 300 to more than 1,750 over the same period. Additional resource teachers and special needs assistant support are being allocated on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs.</P>
      <P>Children with special needs in mainstream second level schools are catered for in ordinary classes with the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. There are 273 resource teachers and 135 special needs assistants in the second level system at present.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department makes funding available for the purchase of computer and other specialised equipment for children with special needs in mainstream schools and in special facilities. In the current year, the level of funding available in this area has been increased from £987,000 to £2,730,000.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to continue to build on the above developments so as to ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require when and where they require it. A key development in this regard is the recent report of the planning group established in my Department to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all levels of education for students with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> I am satisfied that the recommendations brought forward by the planning group provide a valuable blueprint for the development of a more effective special education service. It is my intention to seek Government approval to proceed with these measures at an early date.</P>

      <P>In March 2001, following an assessment by my Department of enrolment trends at the school referred to by the Deputy, the board of management of the school was informed of the decision to withdraw grant-aid with effect from the end of the current school year. The basis for the decision was that, for the current and previous school year, enrolment had reached only five pupils. In that regard, the rules for national schools provide that grant-aid is not continued to a school at which the enrolment falls below eight pupils for two consecutive school years.</P>
      <P>This decision was made on the basis of the information available to my Department at the time, which showed no evidence of potential for a reversal of recent enrolment trends at the school. To date, my Department has received no further correspondence from the school authorities in this regard.</P>
      <P>However, in view of recent statements to the effect that the school's enrolment may increase in the coming year, I have asked officials of the planning section of my Department to contact the school authorities to discuss the matter with them.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern among parents in a school (details supplied) in County Waterford that falling pupil numbers may result in the loss of a teacher; and if he will ensure that the prospective numbers are fully taken into account before any decision is taken.</Quest>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 62 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 55 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year, which is the same staffing as the school currently has.</P>
      <P>The school will also retain the services of a shared learning support teacher for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
