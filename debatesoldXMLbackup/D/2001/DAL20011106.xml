    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In June 1999 the Government established a Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships. The Cabinet committee is supported by a cross-departmental team comprising senior officials from relevant Departments.</P>
      <P>The primary role of the cross-departmental team is to support the Cabinet committee in its task of providing a strong central focus for delivery of key infrastructure and to ensure that any obstacles to delivery are tackled in an effective and co-ordinated fashion across all Departments and agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> I emphasise that responsibility for infrastructural projects under the national development plan still rests with the relevant line Departments while the Department of Finance is responsible for co-ordinating the plan as a whole.</P>
    <P>A progress report prepared by the cross-departmental team was published last April following its submission to the Cabinet committee and to Government. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library. The team continues to support the delivery of priority national infrastructure and to focus on the priorities identified in that progress report.</P>
    <P>I accepted an invitation to address the PPP-PFI Global Summit on 10 October. A copy of my speech has been placed in the Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the programme for Government, the Taoiseach may recall that this Administration promised to re-energise the Luas project. Does he believe putting a carriage on tracks which come from nowhere and go nowhere &ndash; a carriage which was taken away this morning &ndash; is a re-energising of the Luas project? He has presided over this committee. Does he agree that if he had proceeded with the Luas project in 1997, passengers would have been travelling on the Luas for the past 12 months? Does he further agree it is the Government's incompetent handling of the Luas project that has led to such delays and such capital overruns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the light rail project launching the Luas carriages. There will be 25 of them over the next period in the Red Cow station. It will be opened in the next few weeks. I also welcome the ongoing work on the Luas project. There is great interest in the city in seeing the Luas project up and running as soon as possible. I have no doubt it will help substantially in fighting the traffic problems in Dublin. The trams are 30 metres and hold 235 people. The work has moved on apace over the summer months. It will be two years before the full project is completed but it will be of enormous assistance to the people in the west, particularly in the Tallaght-Clondalkin area, and in the south of the city. I look forward to the day when it is up and running. At the consultation process, one of the major issues was that the citizens on the routes wanted to see the process work, its administration and the carriages. It is only right that people see the carriages early on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any word in the dictionary other than &ldquo;incompetence&rdquo; to describe a situation where eight years after the Taoiseach took over as Taoiseach he promises there will be a Luas light rail system running in Dublin? Is the Taoiseach not embarrassed that this was ready to go in 1997, that a project which was at an equivalent stage of advance in Montpellier in France is now up and running and carrying passengers and that he is still promising the people of Dublin that <Col N="275" /> they will have a light rail system in three years time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure from those comments whether Deputy Noonan is for or against the Luas project, but I am for it. I am glad to see the construction of the light rail project throughout the city, although it gives rise to some inconvenience I admit. This will be a great advantage to the people in the future. Many people regret that we removed trams from the city in June 1959 but this gives the city an electronic means of transport with no fumes or pollution. Work is progressing apace in different parts of the city. It is on schedule from the plan launched a number of years ago. I am delighted to see it happening. The depot near the Red Cow Inn will be finalised in the next few weeks. This will have maintenance facilities to hold 40 trams which will be used on both the Tallaght and Sandyford lines. The competition for the award of the operating franchise for Luas is well advanced. It is expected that the preferred bidder will be selected before the Christmas period. It is expected that the project will be on target and that passenger services will begin to both Tallaght and Sandyford in late 2003.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>A number of multinational water companies are anxious to get their hands on our publicly owned water services. This is similar to the experience in England where there have been disastrous consequences for householders such as rising prices and poor service. With regard to any future public private partnerships, will the Taoiseach rule out handing over water provision services in the State to private corporations? Will he commit the Government to keeping our water in public ownership and to investing in it as a service to the people rather than as a method of creating profits for multinationals?</P>
      <P>With regard to the public private finance initiative global summit on 10 October 2001, the Taoiseach did not give a report on its proceedings. He said only that he had attended. Will the Taoiseach outline in detail what he was doing at the summit and what happened at it? Does he not think it tawdry that the leader of the Government should attend a conference involving transnational corporations which want to get their hands on the most profitable sectors of the public service in Ireland and wring as much profit as they can from them? These sectors belong to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is £3 billion available through the national development plan, three times the amount in the previous plan, to keep water infrastructure and quality at an unprecedented high level. There is no question of private involvement in that process &ndash; if there is, I have not heard of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> I gave the opening address at the 10 October summit and that speech is in the Dáil Library. A number of the other speeches made on that occasion are in the public domain. The summit concerned public private partnerships. The previous conference was held in Cape Town in South Africa last year. Some 40 countries were represented along with the European Investment Bank and other European agencies. I am not sure what difficulty the Deputy has with the holding of an international conference in Dublin. While I was at the conference, the subjects under discussion were public private partnerships in Europe and around the world and the benefits of those partnerships. There was no mention of asset-stripping. Instead, co-operation and the progress of public private partnerships around the globe were discussed. I heard no other issues discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there a delay in approving spending plans, as part of the national development plan, in the areas of agriculture, tourism and waste management as reported from Tullamore on 27 October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have details on all the issues involved. The national development plan is a seven-year plan. The proportions of the estimate for each year are being allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report carried in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27 October from the regional assembly in Tullamore, which the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be familiar with, states that the European Commission has failed to sign off spending approval for a number of plans. Who is responsible for ensuring that these projects work? In the Taoiseach's original reply, he indicated that the Department of Finance has the responsibility to make the funding available but the line Departments have responsibility to implement projects. What is the inter-departmental committee doing? What is the Cabinet sub-committee doing if it is not co-ordinating these matters? Why is there a delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered these questions several times. The Cabinet sub-committee comprises representatives of the various Departments and agencies in order to efficiently progress projects that require interdepartmental work. As the Deputy knows, however, individual Ministers are responsible. The sub-committee and the interdepartmental team have introduced the national development plan's strategy as well as a programme to track that plan. It has also introduced an action plan to overcome construction capacity constraints. There is a code of practice between Dúchas and the NRA concerning archaeological interests, and legal reforms have been introduced through the planning Acts. The sub-committee and the interdepartmental team have prepared guidelines for best practice in programme management and have introduced insti<Col N="277" /> tutional reforms for the greater Dublin authority. They have been involved in all those issues but the details of these questions are to be found in the line Departments. The Department of Finance is dealing not only with the Estimates but also the public via the partnerships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Department fails to meet its spending commitments or fails to meet the deadlines agreed at the committee, does the Taoiseach's Department have a role in finding out why there is a delay in waste management spending approval from the European Commission, or in agriculture or tourism? Other than the photo opportunities associated with these events, does the Taoiseach's Department have a monitoring role to ensure&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Please allow the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is speaking out of both sides of his mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to ask a question. The Taoiseach has talked about how he chairs an interdepartmental committee. In the light of reported delays from the town of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am trying to ascertain what role, if any, the Taoiseach has in finding out why there are delays and in ensuring the time lost is recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet sub-committee deals with all issues that come before it &ndash; mainly trying to ensure the national development plan is moved forward on time. The interdepartmental committee and the cross-departmental team deal with the details where difficulties arise. Such difficulties are brought to our attention if we are required to deal with them and the relevant line Ministers deal with the details on a day-to-day basis. The Cabinet sub-committee is bound by the rules of Cabinet confidentiality. We deal with any major problems, and there are quite a number of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the global summit conference which was held in Dublin on 10 October. Is it fair to say the public-private <Col N="278" /> partnership process sees quite a number of areas &ndash; not just transport and water, but also education, hospitals, broadcasting, museums and waste &ndash; as fair game? Those areas include a range of what we take for granted as public utilities. Were they discussed? Will the Taoiseach indicate what discussions took place at that conference? If he does not know, will he find out what took place? Can the Taoiseach be clear with the Dáil and with the people about the benefits of public private partnerships to private investors? The national development plan refers to £1 billion of private financing of NDP projects. Would it be more accurate to call that a loan to the Government with a large interest repayment in the form of tolls which will be levelled mainly on rural communities which are being dissected by motorways? Does the Taoiseach consider it more accurate to call it a loan rather than a financing of the national development plan? There is nothing free or generous about this financing which has much to do with profiteering. Will the Taoiseach be clear about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Public private partnerships are very much part of what is happening the world over. The conference was about experiences of them. The European Investment Bank which chairs the conference brought the benefits of public private partnership to a global audience, not just to the EU but to accession countries and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>To whom was it of benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of benefit to individual countries. Most countries now use public private partnerships. Almost all OECD countries use public private partnerships on one scale or another. Practically the whole capital programme of Spain and Portugal is now public private partnership. Other countries use it less and it is new for us. A sum of £1 billion is mentioned in our roads programme and other smaller amounts are involved in education and water projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view is that public private partnerships can make a significant contribution to delivery of priority, economic, infrastructural projects and the national development plan spells out how that can be done for a range of public services. Delivering the national development plan programmes within the required time frame and the achievement of value for money for the taxpayer are part of the strategy of implementation. Many aspects of that have been pointed out already and rather than go through them all I refer the Deputy to the framework document for public private partnerships which was published last week. It has been agreed between the Government and the social partners and in it there is a broad consensus on the scope of PPPs. There is a broader scope than I said and it describes the process through which the projects can be developed and the benefits that can arise from them. The <Col N="279" /> document spells out the detail and most people have now signed up to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach feel it is dishonest of the Government to persist in spinning the story that the Luas project will be operational in two years' time? The public can see freely on the Government website the report of the advisory committee set up to advise the Government of progress on the Luas project which clearly shows that the contractor reported that it would be almost impossible to complete it in that time and that construction could not be envisaged until the end of 2004. That only concerns the construction and assuming no further hiccups after that, all of the testing of the system and the trams, and driver training and emergency services training, and safety checks, have to be done and that will take at least another 18 months. In view of the length of time this project has taken will the Taoiseach hazard a guess on how long it will take to provide a metro system and if any progress has been made on any aspect of that plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the opportunity to talk to the light rail people recently at a meeting of the Cabinet committee and again on Sunday and they are confident that we will have it in two years time. There was a great deal of scepticism about the progress the project would make this summer but through Inchicore, Kilmainham, the quays and through many parts of the city the project is well ahead. The Red Cow section is completed. The trams that are here now are here for the very reasons mentioned by the Deputy &ndash; to start staff training, testing, safety tests etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Should they not be tested in the factory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters of detail are more appropriate to the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That type of work is well ahead. It does not start at the end of the project and my understanding is that the trams are here so that the work can be done now. The Deputy may have information which I do not have but the Department and the light rail office have stated that they believe the project will be completed by the autumn of 2003. The work is approximately six months ahead of schedule. I know about this because it is going through my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I come back to the issue of responsibility for co-ordination and the meeting of deadlines. The Taoiseach has said the pro<Col N="280" /> vision of money is the responsibility of the Department of Finance, the implementation of any project is the responsibility of the line Department and the Cabinet sub-committee co-ordinates all of this. There are substantial delays in a number of areas and I have given three instances. If there is a delay does the Taoiseach's Department have a role in discovering the reason for the delay and in taking action to recover lost time? Can the Taoiseach confirm that the person appointed to chair the cross-departmental support committee to the Cabinet sub-committee is the person originally appointed in June when the Taoiseach answered a similar question, or is a new person now chairing the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The same person has chaired the committee since the start of the project. There are two committees. There is the Cabinet committee which deals with the national plan and endeavours to move the plan forward. It listens to reports from Ministers and, where necessary, from the agencies which are required to move things on. The Cabinet committee meets monthly, hears reports and keeps an overall watch on what is happening. It is the line Minister's responsibility to deal with the detail, and issues which arise are, of course, discussed at Cabinet. I chair those monthly meetings. The cross-departmental team deals with more detail. It deals with issues &ndash; legal, planning and otherwise &ndash; which affect all the Departments. By working together the Departments can deal with a range of issues. I have listed a number of the issues with which the team has dealt.</P>
      <P>The main public private partnership unit is in the Department of Finance. All relevant Departments have one or more individuals dealing with public private partnership projects. They work to the Department of Finance on these issues because projects must be processed to make sure they give value for money, as Deputy Sargent mentioned earlier.</P>
      <P>The status of the Cabinet sub-committee is the same as that of any other Cabinet sub-committee. It is part of the Cabinet process. Strictly speaking, I should not answer questions on these issues but I do so because they are important matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Six months ago one of the difficulties attached to the national development plan was the shortage of labour, particularly for physical infrastructural developments such as water schemes and roads. Matters have changed rapidly in the past six months and there is now significant spare capacity in these areas. A difficulty now arises from the lack of activity on the part of the Government in ensuring that aspects of the plan come on stream.</P>
      <P>Has a final decision been made regarding the tolling of the major road developments between Dublin and Cork and Dublin and Limerick? If so, why has the decision not been announced and why are members of the Taoiseach's party at local level saying that tolling is not an option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> The Government now faces the major obstacle of the lack of action on regional development. The mission statement of the national development plan encourages greater equity between the regions but a fundamental blockage is caused by the inability of the Taoiseach and his Government to reach a conclusive decision on the national spatial strategy. The national development plan cannot proceed because of a lack of action on the national spatial strategy which has been kicked into touch to ensure that no decisions will be made until after the next election. We are seeing an unravelling of the entire process&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that this process is unravelling? Does he accept that the national development plan is completely off the rails and is on a track similar to the phantom one which was outside his office for the past two days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>Over the next 20 years. The national development plan is based on reports which outline what is immediately necessary. Deputy Flanagan's first point is correct, circumstances have changed significantly over the past six months. Data released last week show price inflation in the construction industry and the rates per hour are still higher than in any other sector of the economy. It is felt that will be brought down which means that a lot of the value eroded in construction price inflation will be given back. That some of the contracts have been awarded to outside interests is also helping. It is expected that a sharp fall off in construction price inflation will be seen. That will give a greater return on national development plan investment.</P>
      <P>An enormous amount of work has taken place on the six major roads. The issue of staff shortages in the areas of planning and design has been overcome by the NRA and most of the planning work is going ahead. There are some difficulties arising from the IFA dispute which has created delays in recent months, but I hope that can be resolved in the short term. Offers have been made which I hope will lead to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the large profits to be made by private investors in public private partnerships, what is the logic of assigning £500 million to the railways while assigning £4.4 billion to roads under the NDP? Will the Taoiseach look again at the imbalance in investment between road and rail? The 1998 national road needs study shows that although motorways will have a capacity of 55,000 vehicles per day, the daily Dublin-Cork vehicle number is 1,700 and Dublin-Limerick is 1,450. Given that level of over-capacity, does the Taoiseach think that building such motorways while effectively starving other modes of transport, such as railways, of investment is good value for money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of reports concerning illegal waste dumping. However, it is a matter for local authorities to address the incidence of unauthorised waste disposal activities. My Department does not have a direct function in this regard or in relation to the performance by individual local authorities of their enforcement role in particular cases.</P>
      <P>Under the Waste Management Act, 1996, it is an offence to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. The carrying on of a waste disposal activity requires either a waste licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, or in certain cases a waste permit from the relevant local authority. The 1996 Act provides that each local authority is generally responsible for the supervision of and the enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end, local authorities have very considerable enforcement powers. They may enter any premises or board any vehicle for the purposes of the Act, require any holder of waste to maintain specified records and provide specified information and take a range of remedial and <Col N="289" /> legal measures in cases where waste has been recovered or disposed of in a manner that causes, or is likely to cause, environmental pollution. There are severe penalties for illegal waste activity. On conviction on indictment, the 1996 Act provides for fines of up to £10 million and-or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years.</P>
    <P>A new landfill levy will be introduced from early in 2002, the revenues from which will be hypothecated to the environment fund. A consultation paper has been issued outlining the main elements of these proposals. Against the possibility that higher landfill costs could lead to increased fly-tipping of waste, additional funding will be provided to local authorities from the environment fund to help combat any such development. Accordingly, the consultation paper specifically invited proposals from the City and County Managers' Association to facilitate the allocation of revenues in this regard, to support dedicated and measurable enforcement initiatives and to control fly-tipping and unauthorised waste activities generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said he is aware that some illegal dumping is taking place. Has he any idea of its extent? I have received numerous reports of illegal dumps in various parts of the country but no action appears to be taken against them by the local authorities or the EPA. Many of our landfills are nearing completion and in many parts of the country commercial waste is banned from them. Small operators will therefore have no option, if there is no alternative available, but to dump illegally. Does the Minister of State agree the crisis I outlined, where there is no alternative to landfill, will inevitably lead to illegal dumping?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a substantial amount of illegal dumping taking place but information on that would not be available in the Department. It is a matter for each local authority to seek to establish the level of illegal dumping in their areas. A senior official in one county was quoted in the press recently as stating that there were about 200 illegal dump sites in Wicklow.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the local authority to be vigilant and to have procedures in place to ensure the people who are creating this nuisance in our countryside are dealt with under the law. The full rigours of the law are available to the local authorities from the point of view of taking prosecutions.</P>

It is a matter for the Minister with responsibility for the envir<Col N="290" /> onment to ensure this does not occur. Is it not a matter for the Department and the EPA to use their influence with the local authorities to ensure illegal dumping does not occur? Why should people pay service charges and heavy commercial rates when others who do not seem to care and who do not wish to pay rates or landfill charges can simply dump waste and get away with it? There are at least 200 illegal dumps in Wicklow and many others throughout the country. It is becoming an epidemic.</P>

      <P>The Government has implemented a wide range of measures to reduce house price inflation, increase housing output to match demand, remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development, afford greater access to the housing market to first time buyers and improve affordability for first time buyers and lower income households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures introduced to improve affordability include revised stamp duty thresholds and <Col N="291" /> rates to ease the burden on first time buyers, measures to discourage speculative demand, the provision of affordable housing under the affordable housing scheme and, in future, under Part V of the Planning and Development Act and significant improvements to the eligibility criteria under both the shared ownership and the affordable housing schemes.</P>
    <P>Last year was the first year of a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme designed to deliver 25,000 of the 41,000 local authority housing starts planned over the period of the national development plan. At the end of last year, there were more than 5,000 housing units under construction, the highest level since 1985. Local authorities expect to start more than 7,000 units this year and to complete or acquire 5,000 units. This would represent an increase of more than 50% on last year's output and yield the highest level of local authority housing output since 1986. I expect that voluntary housing output this year will be around 1,200 additional units which will be the highest level ever recorded in the country.</P>
    <P>Total house completions last year reached almost 50,000 units, the sixth consecutive year of record housing output. Output for the first nine months of this year is up more than 4% on the same period last year, and we are on target this year to achieve the second highest level of housing output on record.</P>

In a recent survey, the Irish Home Builders Association found that the number of house completions will be down by about 10% this year, registrations are down by about 20%, planning applications and planning permissions are down and only 50% of the sites that were supposed to be provided under the serviced land initiative will have been provided by the end of the year.

I know there are problems at present, but the Government will examine the issues to determine the further steps that can be taken and to take whatever measures are deemed necessary to ensure the housing industry continues to thrive. The Government has sought to assist the first time buyer, who was savagely squeezed out of the market before the Government came into office. While not wishing to repeat myself, there was an absence of available land banks and local authority construction plans to deal with the high demand for public housing. The Government has taken a wide range of measures.</P>

      <P>High level discussions have taken place between my Department and representatives of the farming community with a view to resolving problems concerning the compulsory acquisition of farmland for national roads. Compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes, on the basis of fair compensation to landowners, has operated widely in Ireland for many years and is supported by the Constitution and a range of legislative proposals which have been regularly upheld by the courts. Discussions are taking place in the context of the commitment in the PPF to the fair and efficient implementation of compulsory purchase orders.

It is wrong that the Minister did not contact the House to inform Deputies of his absence.</P>
      <P>While I thank the Minister of State for his reply, it does not answer my question. Does he realise how critical this problem has become? No less than 30 major road building projects are at a complete standstill and major inter-urban roads are being held up. Major bypasses, such as those around Monaghan, Gorey, Castleblayney and Tuam, have been held up for between four months and a year, although roads such as those serving Galway, Cork and Waterford have been most affected. Most assessment of environmental impact has to be done in the spring and summer, so it cannot take place until next year, assuming problems have been solved by then. This means that projects will begin at the same time, which will lead to capacity problems. It is possible that certain projects will not take place within the period of the national development plan. At the request of the Government, many building teams, designers and site investigators went all over the world to gather expertise in professional services.</P>

The compulsory purchase system has been established for a long time and its procedures have been upheld by court cases and arbitration. It is the duty of the Government to ensure the spending of taxpayers' money is protected. Negotiation cannot be carried out in this House, but it is proceeding at a high level. It is hoped that the framework that is being worked out will help to resolve the impasse.

      <Quest>the action he proposes to take to stop the large scale encroachment on to public land by traveller traders; and if he proposes to change the Traveller Accommodation Bill, 1998.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26119/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, a local authority has powers to remove an unauthorised Traveller encampment located within five miles of an approved halting site, provided alternative accommodation is available on any approved site to which the unauthorised encampment can be moved. Subject to the same proviso regarding available alternative accommodation, there is also a general power for a local authority to remove an unauthorised encampment where this is unfit for human habitation or is likely to interfere with public or private amenities or constitutes a health hazard.</P>
      <P>Where an encampment is located within one mile of approved Traveller accommodation, it may be removed to a location which is not less than one mile from such approved accommodation, irrespective of whether alternative accommodation is available. These measures were designed to give assurance that areas in which official Traveller accommodation is provided should not become a focus for illegal encampments.</P>
      <P>These legislative measures may not have fully anticipated the type of large scale movement of Travellers which have raised concerns in recent years. Nonetheless, local authorities should use to the full their existing powers under the 1998 legislation together with the range of powers they already enjoy under, in particular, litter, waste management and road traffic legislation to secure abatement of the nuisance presented by large scale illegal encampments. I am pressing local authorities to use the powers currently available to them and I am also examining the extent to which the existing legislation might usefully be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent incidents of unauthorised encampments, in some cases by Travellers who have accommodation available to them, appear to raise <Col N="296" /> issues wider than accommodation matters proper to the Housing Acts, such as issues of public order, intimidation and trespass. I will, therefore, also take up this matter with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with a view to exploring whether this type of incident may require to be dealt with on a broader front.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of all the powers available to local authorities in such circumstances, but surely the Minister of State is not living in such a rarified atmosphere that he is not aware of the practical problems encountered by local authorities in dealing with large scale movement of Travellers to public open spaces, football pitches and parks. The Minister of State's answer is different from the one he gave last year. Can I take hope from the fact that he recognises there is a problem which he did not envisage when the legislation was introduced, although I pointed it out to him? Is the Minister of State saying he is considering introducing legislation to control the large scale movement of Travellers who have left permanent accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation on each local authority to implement the programmes for Traveller accommodation in their areas. That includes providing accommodation either through local authority housing allocations, special housing or halting sites. It also obliges them to provide transient sites. I referred to this on the last occasion this issue was raised here. Local authorities which do not fulfil their obligations in this area will have the problem of people parking illegally on the side of the road. If such people have genuine accommodation needs, the local authority will not be able to take action against them unless they park within one mile of existing Traveller accommodation which has been provided by the local authority.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary what has happened in recent months. In one case almost 600 people with more than 100 caravans moved into an area, created mayhem and caused unimaginable levels of litter and dirt. One cannot turn a blind eye to that. That is not directly related to the accommodation issue. We need to examine this issue from the point of view of Travellers with genuine accommodation needs and of those who move away from their accommodation for the summer months, ignore all levels of authority in the places where they choose to park and who cause litter problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious issue and we must take some appropriate action. There are measures the local authorities can take and I listed some of them. I understand the difficulties they face. In many cases unfair demands are made on housing staff in the local authorities in dealing with this issue as a result of intimidation, etc. Cases have also been reported of people who do this deliberately to extract money. We cannot stand aside without trying to find a way within reason to deal with <Col N="297" /> this issue. We must be conscious of the need to provide proper homes for the Traveller families who do not have them and who are living on the side of the road, although not by choice. In my experience most Traveller women want to live in houses, while many of the men prefer to live in hardstand accommodation. We are providing the facilities they requested.</P>
    <P>We will continue with the housing programme. However, I appeal to local authorities to be more active in implementing the housing accommodation programme for Travellers. That would greatly reduce this problem. It will be more difficult for the local authorities to achieve their objectives if transient sites are not provided.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 73 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals on the signature by Ireland of the convention have been finalised by my Department and arrangements are now being made to secure Government approval to this signature. A number of recent measures have been taken to strengthen the approach to protection and preservation of landscapes in Ireland. These include the introduction of new legislative provisions in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and the issue by my Department for public consultation of draft guidelines for landscape and landscape assessment. These and other measures are designed to support implementation in Ireland of the requirements of the new convention.</P>

      <P>Has the Government memorandum been distributed to all the appropriate Departments? Is the Minister of State aware that a conference of the signatories will be held on 22 November and that there will be an opportunity for new signatories to sign up to the convention? Will Ireland be ready to sign up to it by that date? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be possible. My Department has been preparing proposals for submission to the Government regarding the signa<Col N="298" /> ture of the convention. These proposals are being forwarded to the Department of Foreign Affairs for submission to the Government in due course. That is the normal procedure for an international convention. It might be noted there was no common EU position on this convention. Eleven EU countries have signed the convention to date. However, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have not signed it yet. While the convention was open for signature on 20 November, there was no obligation on Ireland to sign it at that time. I understand only one country has so far ratified the convention. I will see if it can be signed prior to the forthcoming conference.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>the plans he has for a comprehensive national study of existing and closed landfill waste sites, having regard to the findings of a study conducted by Imperial College, London, which found that there were small but measurable increases in birth defects among children born within a two kilometre radius of such sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Health Research Board &ndash; HRB &ndash; to provide a study, utilising appropriate research expertise in health and environmental sciences, which will contain an objective, independent and expert analysis of all available information regarding the likely effects of landfill and thermal treatment, especially incineration, activities on public health and the environment. The HRB study will encompass, but will not be limited to, an evaluation of recorded impacts on public health and the environment from emissions from old landfills and thermal treatment technologies, that is, facilities and technologies in operation prior to the imposition of modern operational requirements and emission standards, and an assessment of the risk posed by emissions from modern landfills and thermal treatment technologies, that is, operating to current EU standards, to public health and the environment. Accordingly, I anticipate that this work <Col N="299" /> will include an assessment of the findings of the Imperial College study published in August 2001.</P>
      <P>I expect a study team to be appointed shortly by the HRB and the study to conclude by end February 2002. A report will be published shortly thereafter. The need for any further dedicated research into the possible impact of landfill sites on public health can be evaluated in light of that report. While the UK study found small excess risks of congenital anomalies in populations living near landfill sites, it identified no causal mechanisms to explain these findings and noted that alternative explanations include statistical factors or other variables which cannot be readily taken into account in ecological studies. It recommended further studies to help differentiate between the various possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The HRB study was announced some time ago and I am surprised that the research team has not yet been appointed. Will specific field studies be carried out on individual landfill sites as part of the study? Is it intended, in particular, to carry out studies on the approximately 500 sites identified by the EPA where toxic materials have been dumped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline the scope of the study.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer the Minister of State to answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I outline the scope of the study, the Deputy can ascertain whether the question has been answered. The study covers an evaluation of recorded impacts on public health and the environment from emissions from old landfills and thermal technologies; an assessment of the risks posed by emissions from modern landfills and thermal treatment technologies; the impact of current emission standards and the risk involved for public health and the environment; a comparison of risks posed to public health and the environment by emissions from modern thermal treatment plants with those posed by similar emissions from other sectors; a critical analysis of claims made by interests promoting and opposed to thermal treatment of waste as to the impact of emissions on public health and environment; and an evaluation of the significance of bio-markers as indicators of exposure to emissions and their significance as indicators of potential health problems.</P>
      <P>It is up to those carrying out the study to determine what specific areas will be examined. It will be a broad-based study and will cover every aspect of this issue. It will be of great value for future estimates in the arguments for and against incineration in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's outline of the scope of the study confirms what I have felt for some time, that the HRB study is intended to <Col N="300" /> provide a scientific justification for the decision that has already been made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to proceed with the building of incinerators as a solution to our waste problem. However, the question I asked relates to approximately 500 old landfills, some of which have been sealed and not used for some time, where it is known that toxic wastes have been dumped. The question has not been addressed.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State direct the HRB and its research team to carry out a study of those sites using the methodology of the Imperial College study to establish whether there are grounds for concern in Ireland? Birth defects or other health worries associated with old landfills may be a cause for concern to people living close to these dumps. Will the Minister of State direct the HRB to examine such dumps to ascertain what materials they contain and what dangers they may pose to people from a health and environmental point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the approximately 500 sites to which the Deputy refers were the subject of an EPA desktop study which concluded that approximately 490 sites might have been used for the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The national hazardous waste management plan recommends the early establishment by local authorities of comprehensive registers of all sites known or suspected to have been used for the disposal of waste in the past and the prioritisation of each such site as a basis for undertaking more detailed risk assessment procedures. Subsequent investigations and necessary remediation strategies will require site-specific information and the development of detailed technical guidance. That addresses whatever dangers the Deputy feels might still remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The remedial measures will be taken when the knowledge is obtained. Notwithstanding that the Imperial College study was the most extensive study into landfill sites in the world, its findings are by no means clear-cut. A UK Government expert advisory committee noted that the findings for birth outcomes were not consistent and that the study provided no evidence that rates of anomalies increased in the presence of landfill sites. It considered that this made it difficult to draw conclusions about the possible health effects of landfill sites on the basis of this study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises the importance of, and need for, a diverse and well managed private rented sector. Government policy accordingly seeks to promote investment in the supply of accommodation on the basis of long-term commitment to the sector.</P>
      <P>The Government's response to the proposals of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector was announced in January 2001 and forms the basis for reform of the sector. It includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a Private Residential Tenancies Board for facilitating speedy dispute resolution, the introduction of legislation to improve security of tenure and to increase the periods for a notice to quit and, in addition, certain limited taxation incentives to encourage increased supply. Some of the taxation proposals have been implemented in this year's Finance Act.</P>
      <P>A wide range of measures has been implemented by the Government to maximise the supply of housing and these include measures aimed specifically at the private rented sector, such as changes to investor stamp duty rates and the rent a room scheme as announced in the budget. Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, is specifically aimed at promoting the supply of student accommodation.</P>
      <P>In announcing the Government's response to the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, I pointed out that complex legislation was required to give effect to many of the changes and that I expected this would involve a two-year timeframe. I indicated that I would, in the interim, establish the Private Residential Tenancies Board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and this was done in October. The board is in the process of setting up its operational procedures with a view to taking dispute referrals in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drafting of the legislation required to set up the board on a statutory basis and implement other commission recommendations is progressing in collaboration with the Department of <Col N="302" /> Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is responsible for the landlord and tenant legislative code. I hope to be in a position to submit a general scheme of the Bill to the Government for approval by the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State realise the housing sector is in crisis and that the crisis was led by the collapse of the rented sector as a direct result of the removal of mortgage interest relief to providers of rental property? Rents instantly sky rocketed and this phenomenon is not a result of the events of 11 September. Is the Minister of State aware that an estimated £900 million in investment in overseas properties has been lost and that rents are running up to 30% higher than mortgages? Is he further aware that major misery is being caused throughout the market, particularly at the lower end? The Government pays out £100 million in rent supports and the accommodation required cannot be obtained, particularly given the level of demand. The Minister of State must reverse his policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have experienced an extraordinary period, with a major economic boom leading to huge increases in the number of people in employment &ndash; 300,000 in recent years &ndash; and it is obvious that the demand for housing has mushroomed as a result. A price bubble developed on foot of this demand and one of the Government's objectives was to try to ensure that this would not be exploited to any great extent by seeking to dampen down prices. The action we took was aimed at ensuring that first time buyers would have access to affordable houses and that house prices would be moderated. We had to take a number of tough decisions and house prices have been dropping. There were enormous increases in house prices, which peaked at more than 40% in 1998. Past experience shows that rents track house prices and supply is the other major factor.</P>

We were previously informed that the heads of the promised private rented sector Bill would be approved by the Government before Christmas. However, the Minister of State indicated that it is intended that only the general scheme of the Bill will be approved before the end of the year.

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State realise the extent of the current crisis? Is he aware that there is a lack of confidence among people which has happened on foot of the Government's inability to realise that its measures, rather than acting in a counter-cyclical manner, have reinforced the difficulties that exist? The Minister of State indicated that he would like to attract people with a long-term commitment to the rented accommodation sector. Would not a good way to achieve this be to place the sector on a professional basis, treating it like any other area of business and linking interest relief with registration with the new tenancy board? Does the Minister of State accept that landlords should not only have to register but that they should be obliged to use a standard contract form? This is the only way to recreate supply, which has virtually disappeared. It is not that the supply has dried up, people are actually ceasing to provide rented accommodation and this is having a huge impact on the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has been actively engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, the Metal Merchants Association of Ireland and other concerned parties with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative which would comply with Directive 2000/53/EC on end of life vehicles. SIMI has recently submitted formal proposals to the Department for a producer responsibility initiative to implement the requirements of the directive. I understand SIMI is also discussing its proposals with the IMVRA and the MMAI.</P>
      <P>The SIMI proposal is currently being examined to see if it can form the basis of an acceptable initiative. It is hoped that early agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme can be secured with the support of all stake holders. However, in the absence of agreement, mandatory obligations will be introduced through regulations to give effect to the directive requirements by April 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that in every urban area there are burned out old cars, vehicles which have failed the NCT and are being used by joyriders to terrorise people in housing estates, and that there is a significant problem regarding the disposal of used motor vehicles? Does he further accept that the primary responsibility for the disposal of used motor vehicles should rest with the producers and distributors of these vehicles? When will the Minister of State introduce regulations to give effect to the European regulations which will come into force by April 2002? Will he continue to be led <Col N="306" /> on a merry dance by the motor industry which seems to be engaging in longer discussions with him on this issue than did the IRA with General de Chastelain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that mandatory obligations will be introduced by way of regulation by April 2002 if there is no agreement. The Deputy is correct to express concern about the number of vehicles which have been abandoned. The annual figure for end-of-life vehicles has trebled in the past seven years, from 54,800 in 1993 to an estimated 175,000 in 2000.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that about 75% of ELVs within the recovery system are recycled &ndash; this mainly involves the recovery of metal. Additional recovery capacity for vehicle fluids, used tyres, laminated glass, plastic components etc. will be required to ensure compliance with the directive's reuse and recycling targets. I am determined to have these measures in place through agreement before April if possible. If not, I will do so by way of mandatory regulation.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister of State set a deadline for the completion of discussions with organisations representing the motor industry? If these discussions reach a conclusion, is it his intention, one way or the other, to introduce regulations which would place responsibility on the motor industry for the disposal and management of disused motor vehicles?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given SIMI's position in the motor industry, it was felt it should have a central role in the implementation of the directive. The society has submitted proposals which were received in the Department on 19 October. We are in discussions with SIMI and other interested bodies, such as the IMVRA, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the EPA, the NUI, Galway, because of its computer-integrated manufacturing research unit, local authority personnel and sections within my Department. It is intended to have this process in place as early as possible, certainly before April. The directive is aimed at meeting new recovery and recycling targets of 85% reuse and recovery by 2006 and 95% by 2015.</P>

      <P>The late Denis Gallagher was buried yesterday in his native Achill, County Mayo. He was surrounded on his final journey by the family he loved and the people he served all his life. As I stated when I heard the sad news on Saturday, he was a giant of the west.</P>
      <P>Denis was born in Achill and was a teacher by profession and a politician by vocation. His whole life was dedicated to serving his community. He was an active member of the INTO, chairman of the Connacht council of Cumann Luthchleas Gael and vice-president of the GAA. He was elected to Mayo County Council in 1967 and to Dáil Éireann in 1973 where he served the people of west Mayo with distinction and dedication until his retirement in 1989.</P>
      <P>During his time in the Dáil, Denis served as Minister for the Gaeltacht, for which he is best remembered. He also served as Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Denis had a deep love of his native place and an abiding concern for the welfare of his community. He was an authentic voice of the people who elected him and served them diligently all his life. He was passionate about the Irish language and the sporting life of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent almost a full day with him last September and, even though he was 79 years of age, he told me he was as active as ever and listed nine or ten organisations in which he was still actively involved. These organisations were not political, but were involved in community issues regarding Leader, western and tourism programmes and so on. He still enjoyed attending meetings and remained involved in three or four national bod<Col N="309" /> ies into which he put enormous effort and interest.</P>
    <P>On my behalf and on behalf of Fianna Fáil, I extend my deepest sympathies to Denis's wife, Hannah, his seven daughters, Máire, Caitríona, Áine, Nóra, Síle, Margaret and Breege, his five sons, Brendan, Denis, Micheál, Pádraig and Terry, and his 30 grandchildren. Like the people of Achill and west Mayo, we have lost a dedicated colleague and a wise friend who enjoyed visiting us and offering advice to the very end.</P>

Ar ndóigh, bhí sé mór leis an bpolaitíocht agus lena pháirtí, Fianna Fáil. Chaith Donnchadh a shaol fhada phoiblí ag obair go dian dícheallach ar son na ceithre cúiseanna sin agus tuigtear dom go raibh sé i mbarr a shláinte agus i mbun gnó suas go dtí cupla lá roimh a bháis obann.

      <P>The late Denis Gallagher had a distinguished career in public life and in this House for 16 years. He was a big man and any short summary of his career does not do him justice. He served as Minister of State in the Departments of Social Welfare and Industry, Commerce and Tourism but is probably best remembered for his time as Minister for the Gaeltacht. Throughout his career he was closely associated with the fisheries industry, founding the Achill Fisheries Co-operative and serving as chairman of Bord Iascaigh Mhara. Along with his considerable political achievements, Denis Gallagher will be remembered by all those who knew him as a gentle and kind man who was very well liked by members of all parties. I extend my sincere sympathy and that of my party to his wife, Hannah, his large family, his sons and daughters, and to his many grandchildren.</P>

      <P>It is hard to think it is only last August since many of us in this House were with Denis Gallagher when he attended the General Humbert Summer School at a session in Castlebar on 24 August. He looked remarkably fit and hale on that occasion and, as the Taoiseach said, was continuing his active interest in a variety of <Col N="310" /> associations and organisations. I remember being in this House with Denis Gallagher. As Deputy Noonan said, he was a natural gentleman. He had a quiet authority about him. He was not a showman and was passionately committed to issues of western development along the western seaboard, particularly in the southern part of the island of Achill, Corraun, which he loved deeply. He was involved with the co-operative fisheries association there on issues related to that aspect of development on the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>He served in a number of different capacities, primarily as Minister for the Gaeltacht, until the change of leadership from Jack Lynch to Charles Haughey when he was one of the many victims of the new regime in which he was not found to have favour, although he subsequently served in later Haughey-led Administrations in a more junior capacity. He will be missed primarily by his own people, his large family, his wife, his 12 children and his many grandchildren and by many friends across the party political divide, not only in the west but across the country.</P>

      <P>I, too, join the Taoiseach and the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in extending my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to the late Denis Gallagher's widow, Hannah, his 12 children and 30 grandchildren. When I came to Leinster House in 1977, Denis Gallagher was Minister for the Gaeltacht. He was a very fatherly figure and I agree with everything that has been said &ndash; he was a thorough gentleman. It is some time since I have seen him but many members of the Government and former members would be familiar with some of his children. Two of them are members of the Garda Síochána and his son, Padraic, is a relief driver in the ministerial driving squad. They are very much like their father and if one meets them, one can see their father in them.</P>
      <P>Denis Gallagher had a very strong commitment to the Irish language and to community development. He was very much into the concept of self-reliance and he sought, in particular, to encourage incentives to increase activity in the west, particularly in Achill and Corraun from where he came. I understand his daughter, Ann, is the principal of the school in Corraun in which Denis was a student. Many of his children work in the public service and not only in the Garda Síochána, but in the nursing, social work and teaching professions. He was an extraordinary man on many levels because, notwithstanding the fact he came from a very rural constituency and had a very large family, he gave everything to public service and to public life. He will be greatly missed, in particular, by his family but also by the people of Achill, County Mayo and the country. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>It is important to recall that as Minister for the Gaeltacht, his role and example as somebody who spoke and promoted the Irish language and the féiniúlacht, to which the Taoiseach referred, is something we should try to emulate in this House as well as outside it. It is important we recall that he was Minister for the Gaeltacht and not Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht, the Islands agus go leor rudaí eile.

      <P>I offer my sincere sympathy to the Gallagher family of Corraun, Achill, particularly to Denis's wife, Hannah, seven daughters, five sons, 30 grandchildren, his extended family and especially the people of Corraun. Denis was a highly respected politician &ndash; one of the best politicians known in Mayo. He was very dedicated to his family and his region. He was very proud of his roots &ndash; rooted in Gaelic Ireland and its language, culture, song and dance and he always tried to propagate it.</P>
      <P>Long before we heard of developing the west, Denis was out there doing his own thing. He founded Údarás na Gaeltachta to make sure the west and the more peripheral regions were developed. He was a great athlete and was involved in the Gaelic Athlete Association and was Connacht Council chairman for a time. As was said, he was involved in many areas &ndash; in the fishing industry, the co-operative industry and in any developments in the region in which he was involved.</P>
      <P>After his retirement he was still very involved, particularly in local efforts. Denis's great ambition was to make sure Corraun played its part in Irish life and in modern Ireland, whether extending ISDN lines or broadband, etc., to Corraun. That was one of his great ambitions. He also had a great interest in Knock Airport and in making sure the west was developed. People at his funeral said they had never seen such a funeral before in Corraun. The number of people who came to his obsequies was unbelievable. People came from all parts of Ireland on account of his association with the Gaeltacht areas. Ní bheidh a leithéid againn arís.

      <P>Denis Gallagher was a true Gael and one of Mayo's finest sons. He will be sorely missed. As a politician he was never flamboyant or aggressive but was an honourable and formidable opponent, and one who displayed at all times a courtesy and understanding of other points of view. His death removes from the political landscape a man with a unique insight into the value of social and rural regeneration, which is there for all to see in his native Corraun.</P>
      <P>Emigrants from Achill the world over were proud to associate themselves with Denis Gallagher and his achievements. The people of Mayo recognised one of their own by returning him on each successive occasion from 1973 until his retirement in 1989. In 1979, he took his removal from high office in this Chamber like the man he was. Fianna Fáil have lost a true and valued politician. Politics has lost an honourable and honest politician whose word was always his bond. His family have lost a father and a leader of his community whose public acceptance was self-evident at his removal and his funeral. To his wife, children and members of his extended family, I extend my deep and personal sympathy.</P>

      <P>I offer my sympathy to the Gallagher family, as has been expressed by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition. Denis Gallagher had a number of loves. He loved the GAA, his family and Fianna Fáil. It was wonderful to see how he fought for the party he loved up to his last day. He was a wonderful community man and one who could get cross-party support. In Westport, where I live, Denis could get 50% of the vote in every election although he lived almost 40 miles away. That highlights the type of man he was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud to say I have taken on many of Denis's traits. I thank God that they have worked for me so far and I hope they work in the future. I watched Denis and learned from him. We had many tussles, on the radio and in Achill, but Denis was always a gentleman, a nice man and one who will be missed by Mayo, the people of Achill and most of all by his family. I am sure Denis was very proud last Sunday when he looked around the community hall that he <Col N="313" /> worked so hard for, and saw his wife and family of 12 children. It was lovely to see it.</P>
    <P>In whatever walk of life they operate, the Gallaghers are a decent family, a nice family, and they will never be seen to act in anything but an honourable way. There is no politics involved when they are dealing with their professions. I say to his wife Hannah, his 12 lovely children, his extended family, the Fianna Fáil party and to the people of Achill and Mayo, that we have lost a wonderful politician and a man of quality and decency. It will be some time before a man of the quality of Denis Gallagher comes along again.</P>

      <P>I also wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to Hannah, the wife of Donnacha O'Gallagher, his 12 children and to his extended family on his death. He has given wonderful service to the county of Mayo. He served Fianna Fáil both locally and nationally. In a true tribute, Donnacha was elected chairman of his local community council only last Friday week. This highlights the extraordinary contribution he has made locally in his village and county, and particularly at national level in Dáil Éireann where he served the Fianna Fáil party between 1973 and 1989.</P>
      <P>He was honoured to have been a Cabinet Minister as Minister for the Gaeltacht, and during that time he founded Údaras na Gaeltachta which has done wonderful work in the development of gaeltacht areas throughout the country. He was also chairman of his local angling group in Corraun and chairman of the Connacht council of the GAA. A guard of honour representing the GAA and the Fianna Fáil organisation was present at his funeral. The number of people who travelled to pay their respects to Denis Gallagher is a mark of the man and his fine achievements over 30 years in public life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Competent management usually responds promptly and appropriately to radically changed circumstances. Certainly, the circumstances have changed radically over the past ten days in respect of the economy. We have had a dramatic collapse in tax revenues which fell last month, and in the first six months of the year there was a 28% drop in inward investment. The numbers on the live register have seen the most serious increase in recent years, with almost 2,000 jobs lost last week alone. The forecast for exports from the communications and information technology sector is that they will fall by 25% in the current year. With output and employment falling at the fastest pace for over four years, would the Taoiseach agree that rather than posing for pretty pictures on non-existent rail lines, it would have been much better to call an emergency Cabinet meeting to put in train an immediate response to the radically changed economic situation of which these items of bad news are a clear symptom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the approach to Christmas, is the Taoiseach aware of the widespread concern and fear many people have about their job security which has now evaporated? As recently as this afternoon, <i>The Irish Times</i> announced up to 250 job losses. If the Taoiseach recognises that fear does he also recognise the need for the Government to bring some degree of certainty and confidence to the market place? Will he give a commitment to having a special debate in the House? If so, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment could announce what early warning mechanism is in place in her Department &ndash; along with the seven individual task forces that are already there, as outlined on 10 October in a reply to a question from Deputy Wall &ndash;  to reassure a frightened public that the Government has not entirely lost control of the economy. Every Member of the House should be enabled to participate fully in such a debate on the uncertainty facing companies such as Aer Lingus and Celestica.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join every Member of the House in sympathising with those members of the work force who have lost or are about to lose their jobs. Such announcements made in recent weeks are deeply regrettable and represent a harsh blow to those affected. For its part, the Government has moved to bring economic <Col N="317" /> growth to high levels, averaging 9% over the past four years. Some 310,000 jobs have been created, giving a total work force of 1.8 million. The downturn has arisen from three issues: foot and mouth disease in the early part of the year; a tightening up in the international information and communication technology sector; and the events of 11 September. We now have to deal with the budgetary situation in a different context to that which we contemplated six months ago, but we will do so. We have listened to predictions made by the EU, the OECD, the ESRI, the European Central Bank, our own Central Bank and the domestic banks. We have to manage our affairs in a different way to remain competitive and sustain economic growth at as high a level as we can. We will continue to create jobs as soon as there is an upturn, which most indicators suggest is probably a year away. Whatever the position, we have to assist the private sector through State agencies and we must remain competitive through our taxation policies. I assure the House that when we present the budget in a few weeks time that will be the Government's main priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The House knows that the Government's incompetence has squandered the boom. The economy has been in a downward spin since the second week of May, yet there has not been a response from the Government. It was inevitable that we would have the job losses that occurred last week. When I asked the Tánaiste about it a fortnight ago, however, she seemed to have no early warning system in place to indicate that this was coming down the tracks. About three weeks ago the Taoiseach told me he was still budgeting for a surplus. Today he says he is adopting a radically different budgetary approach. According to the October figures, expenditure is rising by 21% this year and tax revenue is rising by 2%. To maintain a surplus position will the Taoiseach raise taxes or cut expenditure? Or, will he drop the surplus commitment and budget for a deficit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will continue to try to work for a general Government surplus next year. That is still the position. At the weekend, Deputy Noonan called on us to spend more money and cut spending at the same time. It is a good trick but we have not yet worked it out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it has been a historic week on this island particularly in Northern Ireland where we witnessed two historic events? The first was the establishment of a new police force that will be acceptable to all sections of the community, arising from the Patten Report and the Good Friday Agreement and, second, the successful election earlier today of David Trimble as First Minister and Mark Durkan as Deputy First Minister. Will the Taoiseach join me in expressing admiration for the political courage displayed by the Alliance Party and its members who chose to redesignate themselves to ensure the survival of the Executive and perhaps of the Good Friday Agreement? Their selflessness is a lesson to us all and should ensure that we all now work hard to remove whatever remaining obstacles and impediments there are to the completion and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and to its consolidation in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with Deputy Quinn's remarks. We all hope and pray that the Good Friday Agreement will become the Good Friday settlement. Does the Taoiseach agree that the dividend for everybody is peace? If peace is not fully delivered then people's political positions will be undermined once more. Can the Taoiseach tell us if the bomb in Birmingham, attributed to the Real IRA, is a once off event or has he been briefed on the basis that there may be an ongoing campaign of violence from the Real IRA both here and in the United Kingdom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Quinn in welcoming the new police service of Northern Ireland and wishing it well. I particularly wish the best to Chief constable Ronnie Flanagan who has done an enormous amount of work. He deserves credit for bringing about such changes and I hope people row in and support him. A proper policing service requires cross community support in all areas and I hope that is achieved.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Deputy Quinn and welcome today's election of David Trimble and Mark Durkan. I wish them well and wish also for a speedy resumption of the work of the Executive and the North-South bodies, the British-Irish Council, and the other institutions of the agreement. They can now work towards May 2003, which is the mandate of the institutions, to achieve political progress and they can get on with the politics rather than all the preconditions and the difficulties they have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Alliance Party. It found itself in a difficult position. It looked at what the Women's Coalition did successfully and David Ford as a new leader moved quickly and speedily and was extremely helpful. I agree that what the Alliance Party has achieved by redesignating members is admirable. Mark Durkan, also in a new position, was brave in his decisions last weekend. As both Mark Durkan and David Trimble have said, it was not the tidiest of <Col N="319" /> arrangements but it had to be done that way. I congratulate both and hope we can get cross community support to maintain progress. I also acknowledge the support of the House for the various developments.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan, I would like to think we have seen the end of terrorism but from briefings I have had it is certain there are some units of the real IRA in Britain. There is some reason to believe it is the same one or two units operating for some considerable time. They have not yet been thwarted and will not heed our efforts to stop them. I hope they will be apprehended. We have had more success here. There is a small, dangerous and violent group, determined to continue making life difficult for all. The British media has made comments that perhaps Sinn Féin could control them. That is totally wrong. I wish it could be so simple. It will take the security forces of Britain, the North and here to thwart them and we will continue to give room and resources to the Garda to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the strength of suspicion, as represented by the Unionist vote in the Assembly in Northern Ireland in the election of both the Deputy First Minister, and the First Minister himself, is an indication that there has been a loss of confidence within some sections of the Unionist community in the operation of the Good Friday Agreement? It therefore behoves the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister Mr. Blair to ensure that the other strands of the Good Friday Agreement, the East-West strand, the British and Irish Council, the North-South bodies are all brought into play as quickly as possible. The consolidation of all of the confidence building measures that are part and parcel of that agreement must be actively implemented without let or hindrance to rebuild the confidence that has been eroded because of delays with regard to decommissioning or because of delays with regard to the implementation of different aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. When does the Taoiseach anticipate that a meeting of the British-Irish Council will take place, what will be on the agenda and what steps does he hope to see it take in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Deputy Quinn. I have spoken to David Trimble and Mark Durkan about fixing dates for all strands of the agreement to proceed. The order in which these take place is not of great concern but we must move things forward quickly. In the hope that the events of the last few days would turn out well, we have already worked out with the secretariat in Armagh a detailed position on all of the strands in the North-South bodies and we have put forward agendas. We will have to discuss them with the new Executive but we are ready to do that. Having spoken with Deputy O'Kennedy I know that this House is ready and there is a <Col N="320" /> meeting due shortly on the parliamentary tier. The Government is ready, as soon as a date can be arranged, for a British-Irish Council meeting. It is important to use any opportunity between now and 2003 to win back the support of those people who believe the Good Friday Agreement cannot deliver what they believe is necessary.</P>
      <P>We can move on now and establish the institutions and the agenda. We can examine the issues still causing difficulties such as the Ardoyne and we can move forward on economic issues and make progress as quickly as possible. We are ready to do that.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago the Taoiseach undertook to consider publishing a clarifying paper on several Bills which are promised before the end of November and which arise, <i>inter alia, </i>from the seven unsigned international conventions which arose tentatively from the meeting of the justice and home affairs Ministers of the European Council and any consequent emendations to the European Convention on Human Rights. Has the Taoiseach decided to publish this paper?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science's officials have been using as a defence in the courts the likely publication of the Education (Children with Disabilities) Bill.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i> asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if she will report on the recent spate of job losses in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the workers who have been made redundant both at Celestica and those who have been laid off at Tara Mines. I extend that sympathy to their families. Furthermore, I express my sympathy to the employees at Braun, <i>The Irish Times </i>and other companies who have received similar bad news in recent days. These redundancies and lay-offs are a direct result of the current severe downturn in global economic activity, particularly in the United States. I assure the House that every effort will be made to find alternative employment for those made redundant. The Government will remain in close touch with the management of the parent company of Tara Mines with a view to ensuring that operations are recommenced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The job losses at Celestica have come on foot of the withdrawal by another company &ndash; Motorola &ndash; of contracts for the manufacture of mobile phones. While IDA Ireland has been in constant contact with the company over recent months &ndash; I have had discussions with the company's general manager in Ireland &ndash; the company was not aware of the withdrawal of these contracts until 4 November. The IDA will continue to work with the company in consolidating its existing operations which will continue to employ 500 workers. Because north Dublin is currently going through a difficult period of job losses, I announced yesterday the establishment of a training and jobs placement initiative to be chaired by the manager of Fingal County Council, Mr. William Soffe. FÁS, the local area partnerships, the local authority, the county enterprise board, CERT and Enterprise Ireland will work to ensure that those losing their jobs are fully appraised of other employment opportunities in the area and are offered training or support for business opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility for the mining industry comes within the remit of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. I have not had any discussions with the management of Tara Mines on the proposed temporary closure. On 1 November 2001, Outokumpu &ndash; the Finnish company which owns Tara zinc mine &ndash; announced it was placing the mine on care and maintenance basis. Consequently all of the approximately 670 employees were issued with protective notice of temporary lay-offs due to commence on 17 Nov<Col N="326" /> ember. About 50 staff will remain on maintenance and essential services.</P>
    <P>The company cited the downturn in global economic conditions and the resulting low base metal prices as the reason for its decision. The major uses of zinc are for galvanising steel and the manufacture of brass and dye-casting alloys for household, industrial and automobile components. Demand is sensitive to economic slow-down. The company indicated that, at current prices, the operation at Tara is losing in excess of 3 million per month. I understand the market price for zinc has fallen considerably in recent months from $1,000 per tonne in March 2001, to about $750 at the end of October. In announcing its decision the company said it will conduct reviews on an ongoing basis and that operations will resume as soon as market conditions allow the mine to become viable. Since the announcement FÁS has been in contact with the company and has offered its services to both the company and the workers. A meeting between FÁS and the company for the purpose of agreeing specific measures of support and assistance is scheduled to take place tomorrow. The company has, however, expressed concern to FÁS about people being available to return to work and wishes to emphasise that the proposed lay-off is temporary. The industrial development agencies continue to actively promote the Navan area as a location for investment. FÁS and the other agencies will remain in close contact in order to minimise the effect of the lay-offs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past 12 months the north Dublin region has witnessed the closures of Gateway in Clonshaugh with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs and the closure of Motorola in Swords, also with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs. Dell in Poppintree shed 55 jobs, 60 jobs have been lost at Electric World in Blanchardstown and Santry while 317 jobs have been lost at the Kylemore bakery in Finglas. Datalex in Malahide has shed 29 jobs, several hundred temporary employees have lost their jobs at Aer Lingus and Celestica yesterday announced 450 job losses in Swords. Will the Tánaiste accept that the effect of these announcements and redundancies has devastated the economic life of north Dublin, particularly Swords, Malahide, Skerries, Balbriggan and Donabate and all towns and villages? Does she accept that the Government proved unwilling and unable to respond to the crisis? Does she accept that even if one-eighth of the nearly 6,000 jobs that have been lost in the past 12 months were lost in any other region the Government would already have put in place a mechanism to deal with such a crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there have been difficulties. However, to put things in perspective, there are 117,000 more people at work in Dublin today than there were in April 1997 and the rate of unemployment in the Dublin area fell by 8.5% as against a national drop of 3%. FÁS informs me <Col N="327" /> that there are 1,100 job vacancies in the north Dublin area. There are companies, including Swords Laboratories and Organon, which are recruiting workers in north Dublin. We need to put things in perspective and ensure we do not hype the obvious difficulties we are experiencing. There has been a huge downturn in the global economy, particularly in the ICT sector. Unfortunately, it has been compounded by the events of 11 September which have affected tourism and aviation and sub-supply companies.</P>
      <P>It is important we seek to maintain as much activity as possible in Ireland. The IDA and Gateway, for example, are at an advanced stage of negotiation with a company which may take on about 150 of the Gateway workers to support Gateway's customers in Europe. The reason for Gateway's closure in Ireland was the company's decision to pull out of the entire European market. It had nothing to do with the circumstances prevailing in Ireland. The company is ceasing production in Europe because it has not been performing well in that market. However, it wants to continue to support its European customers and in recent months we have worked to try to ensure that support is provided in Ireland. We are very optimistic the negotiations will be very successful in keeping about 150 of Gateway employees working in a similar area of activity, albeit with a different company. I understand the vast bulk of the other Gateway workers have found alternative employment.</P>
      <P>The initiative I established yesterday will work on the ground in north Dublin with the people who have been made redundant and the various companies. Mr. Fogarty, the general manager of Celestica, has assured me he will work very closely with the body I am putting in place to ensure as many of the workers as possible find alternative employment or, where that is not possible, are offered training for other jobs in the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will heed the Tánaiste's advice to put matters in perspective. Yesterday's announcement in north County Dublin brings to 15,000 the number of redundancy notices served in the State since the start of the year. Does she accept that 15,000 redundancies amounts to 15,000 families and up to 15,000 mortgages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste's response to the crisis is less than satisfactory. She has changed focus by announcing what she describes as a training and jobs placement initiative. Could she advise the House of the difference between this and an inter-agency task force or a multi-agency group, which I understand she recently set up in response to lay-offs in County Louth? The difference is minimal and it appears to be something thought up by a doctor of spin in her Department to deflect from the tired old task force formula because 23 task forces are already in operation, all of which are under performing and many of which have <Col N="328" /> done very little to address the jobs crisis of the past nine months in particular.</P>
    <P>Will the Tánaiste outline to the House the exact protocol in her Department for what she describes as an &ldquo;early warning system&rdquo;? What exactly does it mean? What time frame has been put in place for the various inter-agency and multi-functional task forces she has set up around the country? Has she set a deadline for reporting progress?</P>
    <P>Does the Tánaiste accept yesterday's admission by the chief executive of the IDA that the country is suffering a recession?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Very marginally, yes, but to put things in perspective 15,500 redundancies were notified to my Department up to the end of October. In 1993-94 the figure was 18,000 per year. Proportionally, given that the base is much higher because there are 400,000 more employees today than in 1994, we have had much worse years in recent times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am asked a specific question, I will answer it. However, I will not be tempted to play party politics with the very difficult circumstances facing individuals and companies.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into semantics, but there is a difference between the group I announced yesterday and some of the task forces that have been put in place. The initiatives deal with local circumstances on the ground. In north Dublin, there are 1,100 vacancies and some companies continue to recruit. We want FÁS and CERT and the agencies we have established to work with the employees who have been made redundant in an effort to place them in these jobs. Where they are not suitable, for example, if Celestica workers might not be suited to jobs in the pharmaceutical industry although I understand the contrary is the case, training initiatives should be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other parts of the country investors are pulling out leaving a vacant factory. That is not the position here. I remind the House that Celestica is committed to Ireland and will remain here providing 500 jobs. If the market improves, which is <Col N="329" /> inevitable, I hope the company's activities in Ireland will grow. There is no vacant factory, to which a task force could bring foreign investors with a view to encouraging acquisition. The task here is to find alternative employment in alternative companies for people being made redundant.</P>
    <P>There is no magic warning system which would alert me that Motorola would inform Celestica in the United States last Sunday that it would no longer honour the legal contract it signed. I use the term &ldquo;legal contract&rdquo; because one cannot have a stronger commitment than a legal contract. Motorola is not proceeding because the mobile phone industry globally has gone through the floor and it, in particular, is experiencing huge difficulties. Celestica has to respond to this very quickly to ensure it remains viable.</P>
    <P>No early warning system can provide that kind of information, but the one we have consists of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, the three agencies for which I have responsibility. They are in fairly constant contact and engage with their client companies in regular assessments of their position. In particular, we have been involved in an assessment of the ICT sector which, as has been known for some time, has been in difficulties.</P>
    <P>We get the best information we can from the agencies working with the companies on a daily basis. We do not always know what will happen and have received warnings which, thankfully, have not come to fruition because efforts have been made, through the agency, to help the companies in terms of showing greater flexibility on or, in some instances, renegotiation of agreed grant aid packages, helping with research and development or attracting more value added activities to Ireland. We have been successful in keeping activity in Ireland. We want to continue with that important task.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste informed us about the content of her talks with the Tara Mines company. Is she satisfied that the redundancies arise from a drop in the world price of zinc? If so, has she made arrangements to discuss the matter at the next Council of Ministers meeting? If she has not done so already, will she confirm she will arrange a meeting? I ask the Tánaiste to discuss with the Minister for Finance introducing incentives in the forthcoming Finance Bill to provide the same level of incentive for job creation in Meath as in the BMW region. Meath is at a disadvantage having the BMW region on the one side and Fingal on the other. Will the Tánaiste assure the House that these jobs will be restored in full when the price of zinc rises? When does she expect that to happen? What are the main factors influencing the price of zinc on the world market and has she any proposals to address them?</P>

      <P>I do not have responsibility for mining or the marine industry, so it is not appropriate for me to deal with the company in question or to raise issues related to mining at EU <Col N="330" /> level. That is a matter for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he is aware of this debate. Half the mines in the world are in trouble at present. There is an over-capacity in the industry. There is a mis-match between supply and demand. Mines in Canada and the United States have recently closed. There will inevitably be huge restructuring. Over-capacity in any market leads eventually to restructuring. Some companies will go and others will stay. Obviously there will be rationalisation but I do not know when that will happen. Until it happens there will be difficulties for Tara Mines. I am satisfied it is the world market conditions that have led to this decision &ndash; it is protective notice not redundancy &ndash; and the company has made it clear to FÁS that it wants to recruit the workers when the market conditions change and I hope that can happen soon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The BMW region is a defined geographic region and Meath is not included in the BMW region, as the Deputy is aware. The Government was not free to pick and choose particular counties, the counties had to be contiguous. Meath has a good infrastructure, it is very close to the airport and unemployment in Meath is low. Grant aid is only one part of the package. It is not the reason companies locate in certain places. It may be the icing on the cake but at present we are talking about job maintenance. There are relatively few investments being made now because of the uncertainty both in the global financial markets and in industry generally. We must work with the companies, be they in Meath or elsewhere, to maintain as many jobs as possible. We have a fairly generous and very flexible approach in terms of the training regime, the support for research and development and the other supports for industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to address here the appalling level of job losses. Does the Minister agree that unless research and development facilities are bedded down in Ireland, as they are in the United States, and indigenous employment is encouraged, the mobile type of investment which represents so much of what people depend on for employment will continue to be siphoned off to eastern Europe and beyond? The average weekly wage of an electronic engineer in Hungary is £75. In Ireland that amount would not keep a person in food let alone accommodation or to look after a family.</P>

Will VAT on research and development equipment be lowered or even removed so that an indigenous research and development base can be consolidated in this country? The lowering of the rate of VAT or its removal for repair and maintenance work would ensure a proper service industry which is indigenous. Will measures like these be part of the Minister's recommendations to the Minister for Finance in framing the budget so that in the future there will not be a continuance of the cycle of jobs leaving our shores and going to cheaper labour markets elsewhere?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only closure in the past week as a result of relocation was that of AFM in Dundalk. That was very basic production, very low value-added activity where the labour costs were 40% to 50% of the overall unit cost. The company was therefore not able to compete with companies from central and eastern Europe, from Asia and other places. There are very few European countries, if any, that still have that kind of activity. We need to consider the different things that are happening. The majority of redundancies are occurring as a result of the economic slowdown. Deputy Sargent is correct, where research and development takes place there is a greater chance that activity will happen close to where products are researched and developed. The strategy in recent times has been to move up the value chain and this requires a higher level of skill and education. A lot of the support now being given to companies is to maintain existing jobs and to move those companies up the value chain.</P>
      <P>There are tax implications and one of the downsides of a low corporate tax regime is that it is often unattractive to carry out research and development where corporate taxes are low. There are issues to do with tax credits or a multiple of the cost of research and development. I support what the Deputy says and hope that we will be able to encourage new thinking in relation to that matter. We must seriously examine the incentives that may be put in place both in terms of the skills base, which we are doing, and the other competitiveness issues. Our tax system could be made attractive particularly for research and development. We are pursuing that with the Department of Finance in the context of upcoming Finance Bills.</P>

        <b>: </b>Celestica, Motorola, Dell, Gateway and Otokumpu are some of the names which featured prominently for sharp and disastrous job losses in recent weeks and months. Does the Minister agree there is a dangerous over-dependence, encouraged by the Government, on multinational corporations in terms of the direct employment and employment in downstream industries? Does she agree that such corporations have enjoyed massively favourable tax concessions over many years, a highly <Col N="332" /> educated workforce, courtesy largely of the taxpayer, and massive profitability? Does she agree that probably between £30 billion and £40 billion in profits has been sent abroad in the past five years? Does she believe it is moral that such companies should dump thousands of Irish workers on the sidelines at the first sign of a tremor in international capitalist markets, irrespective of the future of those workers? Many workers in north and west Dublin are young people who have purchased homes and have expensive mortgages while others have families to feed.</P>
      <P>In view of the spate of job losses in north and west Dublin from multinational corporations, over which the Government will say it has no control, will the Minister agree it is criminal that the Government is refusing to invest in an indigenous company over which we have full control? I refer to Aer Lingus where such investment could stop the loss of 2,000 jobs instantly and avert the massive damage to the communities in which the workers live if those job losses go ahead. It is criminal that the Government is refusing this investment in view of the tragic losses for other workers in multinational corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several multi-locational or multinational Irish companies, such as Iona, Trintech, CRH, Kerry, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks. There are many originally indigenous companies that are now multinational or multi-locational. It is not an issue to do with the ownership of the companies or where they may or may not belong, it is to do with competitiveness, with ensuring that we remain as competitive and as attractive as possible for industrial development.</P>
      <P>Thousands of people in Ireland work in multinational companies, in foreign companies. Thousands of others work in Irish companies which supply those foreign companies, not just in Ireland but abroad. Many of the successful Irish companies gained their initial management experience and expertise by people working in foreign companies and subsequently going on to start up their own companies. We live in a world that is much more open than it was previously. When world growth and world trade was expanding in recent years Ireland did extremely well in that context. Ireland remains a very good place in which and from which to do business. Ireland offers a solution to many companies that are now restructuring, closing operations and rationalising their activities. Technical support can be based in a single location in Ireland and we must sell the attractiveness of Ireland, even in this difficult time, to those companies which are looking for solutions. As chief financial officers examine the financing of companies in terms of how they can make cutbacks, Ireland may offer a solution in that, instead of such companies having several locations in the world, they may be encouraged to consolidate much of their activity in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> I have huge sympathy for those losing their jobs or those who will have to endure the uncertainty of trying to find a new job, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. Many workers, their families and communities and many companies find themselves in a very difficult situation. They have my undertaking that we will assist them in whatever way we can. State aid is an issue not only for Aer Lingus but for other companies. As the Deputy is aware, notwithstanding the difficulties being experienced, we are not free to give operating aid to companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not very laid back about the crisis on the northside? Deputy Seán Ryan listed 6,000 jobs that are going or gone. The Minister pointed to 1,100 possible vacancies. Apart from the £180 million wage bill involved, there will be a major loss of service purchases from business across the northside. For every one of 6,000 jobs that will be lost, another job will be lost elsewhere on the northside. Is it not wearing a bit thin to talk about a job training and recruitment initiative? Does the Minister consider it is time to change the redundancy Acts, which offer half a week's pay per year of service to many of those workers who are losing their jobs?</P>
      <P>Given our Celtic tiger economy, that seems extraordinarily niggardly. Will the Minister consider it appropriate that enterprise funds should be automatically established when there are significant job losses of this scale so that people seeking to set up on their own could automatically draw down money instead of having a training and jobs placement initiative? Will she consider other measures that can assist people who face large deficits in their mortgage repayments. Traditionally, no assistance has been available to deal with those types of problems.</P>
      <P>There is a need to examine the northside more holistically, to use that awful term, than the Minister is willing to do. Serious meltdown is being faced in one square mile on the northside. There is a need for the Government to be more alert to the needs of that area and to be more creative in providing solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not talk in terms of a meltdown or recession, or make a panic response. We must all have cool heads and make a calm response. Celestica will pay redundancy of six weeks' pay per year of service. I acknowledge that redundancy payments are not generous, but in so far as that company's redundancy payment <Col N="334" /> is more reasonable than other offers, I welcome it.</P>
      <P>There have been many job cutbacks on the northside, but there has also been much growth. I mentioned two companies that are currently recruiting. Swords Laboratories is recruiting 100 people. I am not certain of the number being recruited by Oregonan, but I believe it is in that region, or maybe it is higher. The same applies to other smaller companies. I share Deputy Richard Bruton's view that for every job lost in a company one other job is indirectly lost.</P>
      <P>In addition to the training and jobs placement initiative, we have been more generous in providing venture capital funds recently and that will have to be the case even more so next year because I anticipate that the private sector will be more conservative. Therefore, Enterprise Ireland must be more proactive on the venture capital side.</P>
      <P>We are also examining issues relating to competitiveness funds for companies operating just above the margin. Sometimes much of the emphasis is on what is called hypotential start-ups or working to get new investment. We must equally work aggressively to maintain existing investment because replacing investment that is withdrawn is very difficult, and it will be particularly difficult over the next number of months until we see our way through this global economic slowdown.</P>

I have no doubt he will do the best he can and that he will work wonders provided the necessary resources are made available to this agency. Will the Minister give a commitment that they will be made available? Is she aware that in the post-Cahill plan situation whereby a task force was initiated in 1993 and recommendations were made in 1996 and 1997, many of those recommendations were not implemented? Is she aware that one of those recommendations was the setting up of an enterprise centre in Swords, which was not established? Given that this task force did not have the services of a secretary to answer a telephone call or to type a letter, will she give a commitment that whatever resources are available will be made available for this agency? In the context of the crisis that has been addressed here this afternoon, will she give a commitment that other companies will be attracted to locate in this area? Will she, on behalf of the Government, give a commitment to the workers and their families that the Government will do everything in its power to provide replacement jobs for some of those lost in the region?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do. Given the slowdown that is under way, particularly the difficulties in the ICT sector, that is inevitable. In the first instance, I believe some of the expansions that were due to go ahead will be delayed. We are living through a period of major uncertainty. There was uncertainty in any event prior to 11 September, but that event compounded the difficulties for all of us. It is inevitable there will be more job losses. If the Deputy is asking me am I aware of a particular company about which I am concerned that will be in difficulty tomorrow, the next day or next week, I do not have a list indicating that X, Y, or Z is in difficulty, but we know that companies in the ICT sector, particularly those servicing or supporting mobile phones, are in particular difficulties and major efforts are being made to engage with those companies and to help them in whatever way we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that relocation may not necessarily take place when a sweatshop economy, for want of a better term, gets favourable treatment over a country like Ireland and that a transnational corporation may be only downsizing here, as rationalisation takes place wherever it happens to be located? She talked about creative approaches to the unemployment crisis. Many families in Dublin North recognise it is necessary to put in place employment practices that may involve work sharing or different types of working arrangements. That should have been more creatively done in Aer Lingus rather than the large-scale announcement of job losses. Will she put the message across to those in a position to make decisions that it may not be necessary to lay off the large number of people some companies are talking of in that there may be other ways to address the difficulties?</P>
      <P>The Government might more seriously consider initiatives such as a guaranteed basic income, which would provide an income for people who can then get a living wage by working for fewer hours than they would otherwise have done. Those options require Government participation as well as the participation of the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>What we need is the maximum amount of flexibility. Activity happens wherever it is competitive for it to happen. It is not just a function of wage costs or prices. A host of issues affect competitiveness, such as skills, education, infrastructure, research and development and so forth. We must continue to work hard to ensure <Col N="336" /> we are as competitive as possible. Ireland, like most countries in Europe and virtually every member state of the EU, is no longer competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries for basic production.</P>
      <P>We are not in a world where we can give any guarantees. We have a minimum wage and the challenge is to ensure that those who earn the minimum wage are taken out of the tax net. Notwithstanding the difficult budgetary situation, I hope we will be able to, if not meet that commitment, come close to meeting it because it is important. There are two ways of increasing take home pay, one is through reducing tax and the other is through nominal wage increases. If we can use the tax system, which we have done in recent years, we can further the competitiveness of this economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not here for the earlier part of the debate but I was dealing with another case of a factory closing. Is the Tánaiste aware of the serious situation in Cavan due to the fact that Teradyne Ireland Ltd. has pulled out of its commitment to build a factory there? More importantly, is she aware that 300 jobs were lost in Monaghan as a result of the closure of Monaghan Poultry Products? The Tánaiste wrote to me and other Deputies to explain her policy on the Border region. However, there is a new beginning in that area with the appointments in Belfast this morning of a First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Given that the Border region did not benefit in the past from IDA investment, there should be a strong effort to do something there now. The loss of 300 jobs in a town like Monaghan is as serious as the job losses in Aer Lingus in Dublin. The situation cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's change in policy to relieve from tax those on lower pay. It is a welcome change or U-turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a U-turn. I introduced the minimum wage and I am committed to rewarding those who work for a living. I have said on many occasions that many members of the rich community do not pay tax. Some of them are tax exiles and do not pay any taxes in this country.</P>
      <P>The Border region, as a result of the 30 years of civil unrest and violence in Northern Ireland, was cut off from its natural economic hinterland and the Border counties, including Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, suffered enormously. Growth rates in that area are far less than those in all other parts of the country. That is the reason there was such huge celebration when Teradyne announced it would build a huge operation involving 800 employees in Cavan. It was the first major IDA investment there for 24 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has had serious difficulties in recent months. It also encountered planning difficulties. A single individual, as is his or her right, <Col N="337" /> appealed the decision of Cavan County Council to An Bord Pleanála. That delayed matters by a considerable length of time as the company had hoped to be on site and beginning construction last January. That was not to be, however, because the planning permission was only granted last week. It was an additional factor although not the sole reason for the difficulties. The delay did not help.</P>
    <P>Teradyne will maintain its existing operation in Cavan where it employs more than 40 people. That shows a commitment to Cavan and when the market situation changes I hope the company will be in a position to make further investment in the Cavan region. It is significant that it will maintain its existing operation and the employees it recruited over the past 12 months.</P>

The Tánaiste was responsible for establishing the Donegal task force which eventually published worthy recommendations and a strategy to address the endemic unemployment problem in the county. The rate of unemployment is many times the national average. Can the Tánaiste give an assurance that sight will not be lost of the problems in Donegal? They are ongoing and endemic. I am aware that difficulties are cropping up in other parts of the country but will everything possible be done to implement the worthy, well thought out and constructive proposals of the Donegal task force, a task force the Tánaiste was responsible for initiating?</P>

      <P>The ones that came within my remit, to the best of my knowledge, have been implemented. We have announced more jobs than job losses in IDA foreign companies in Donegal in the past four years. There were more than 1,900 job announcements. Donegal is an attractive location and is a priority for investment, as is the BMW region in general. The county has been doing well but things will be difficult due to the economic slow down.</P>
      <P>The remaining aspects of the recommendations relate to infrastructure. The key to Donegal's future, because it is so peripheral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the country, is better roads and broadband infrastructure. Electricity and energy infrastructure is essential as well. There is a commitment from Government to put that infrastructure in place. It is extremely important.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I made the point that the Bill's title should read &ndash; the Dublin Heritage Fund Bill. I am disappointed that its provisions do not cover the rest of the country; everything appears to be orientated towards Dublin. Five institutions in Dublin will gain from it and all the directors are Dublin appointees. It is a good job the Minister did not appoint the manager of the Dublin football team because Tommy Lyons would have had no chance given that he is not from Dublin. I hope we can extend the remit of the Bill and the resources it provides to the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>I do not pretend to be an expert on heritage or culture but I have a keen interest in Westport House. I remember when the Mullan Kilbride hoard was found by John Dyra. It is now on display in Dublin. I appeal to the Minister to have that collection brought to Turlough House in its native county. It would add to the attractions of the House. It is a reasonable request. At the time it was found, there was great excitement in Mayo as many people were delighted to see it. I compliment the farmer, John Dyra. I also compliment the Department because at the time, during the 1980s, money was not as plentiful. The Department saved the day by acting swiftly and making a contribution to the farmer. I am delighted it is on display in this country. The matter of Westport House, to which I will return, is relevant in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has been helpful in relation to the national park in Mayo. The people of Ballycroy are proud that the project is going ahead. Many people, including the Minister and myself, <Col N="339" /> worked to ensure that the project would go ahead. I ask the Minister to ask that Ballycroy is remembered when the park is being named. I do not mind whether the park is named the Mayo Ballycroy national park or the Ballycroy Mayo national park, but the people of Ballycroy want their area to be mentioned. Ballycroy is a deprived area which has suffered from emigration and its people would love to see it in lights. I ask the Department to be reasonable and to include the name of Ballycroy.</P>
    <P>I wish to make two points in relation to artefacts. I have spoken to many people in relation to this Bill, including people with an interest in history, such as my friend, the former Senator, Patrick Durcan. He pointed out to me a number of months ago that there is a massive amount of records in courthouses throughout the country. All such records should be brought together to form a collection of historical value. The second point I wish to make relates to the records held in lighthouses, including a number of lighthouses in Mayo. At this late stage I hope the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands makes every effort to compile the records that are in lighthouses and courthouses as they are of national historical interest. People should be able to access the records to research what was happening in this country many years ago.</P>
    <P>I recently read that there is a collection of valuable letters relating to the Siege of Limerick in Westport House. Jeremy Browne, or Lord Altamont, is trying to preserve the house and its artefacts. When I was a member of Westport UDC a number of years ago, a number of senior politicians in my county spoke to the then Fine Gael Government to try to establish a public private partnership for Westport House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Turlough House project, which is under the control of the State and about which I will say a few words later. I was amazed that entry to the museum is free, which shows how many such places I have visited over the years. It is wonderful that such facilities are free as it encourages school children to visit them. As Minister, Deputy de Valera should write to every school in Connacht and Ulster to invite them to visit the museum at Turlough House, while explaining it is free. The Minister should write such letters before the summer season starts again. Visits from school groups would help tourism and would enable young people to develop a sense of history. We spend a great deal of money promoting many things, but money promoting Turlough House would be money well spent. The promotion of our culture in schools will ensure that young people are interested in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has played a small part in helping Westport House. Jeremy Browne, Lord Altamont, has worked hard to preserve artefacts and the house, but the State has not been very helpful. I see nothing wrong with a public private partnership to aid the preservation of <Col N="340" /> Westport House. We have lost enough artefacts from the country. In the past, historical documents were taken from Westport to be sold abroad and their whereabouts are not known. The preservation of the valuable letters relating to the Siege of Limerick should be investigated and should be discussed with Lord Altamont, who would be interested. The Browne family was once highly thought of in the legal profession and I would love to see documents from that era held by the State.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with a departmental pilot scheme to assist Lord Altamont to make the documents available to the public. He worked hard over the years and he is interested in the heritage of the house and the entire country. It would be wrong not to do something for somebody who has worked against the tide and who has been committed to the house and its contents. It would be a shame if the State did not play a part in the preservation of the documents. We have moved beyond civil war politics and we should ensure that the contents of the house can be kept in the country. The artefacts and documents do not have to be taken over by the State. An arrangement whereby the State assists Jeremy Browne to make them available is possible and should be entered into.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, who made a nice speech at the opening of the country life museum at Turlough House. She was very pleasant and the people of County Mayo were delighted to see her. I was a little disappointed with some of the politics that was played that day, but I will not discuss that this evening as I wish to discuss the success of the project. I was delighted the Minister and representatives of the Arts Council were present. I think the council now regrets that it once voted against the Turlough House project as it has been a marvellous success and it will continue to succeed.</P>
    <P>We are very proud of our local poet, Paul Durcan, who added to the occasion. The McBride family in Westport are relatives of the poet, whose family also came from the town. He was highly impressed with the project and he added to the occasion. I was delighted that a native of the county was invited to add his special brand of poetry to the day. It was a nice day and the project has worked up to now. All other artefacts from County Mayo that are in Dublin should be brought to the museum, now that it is operating and attracting visitors. I compliment all involved on the day as it was an impressive occasion. The opening of Turlough House has added to the tourism attractions of County Mayo. It is an asset that will draw people to the county and I hope there will be record visitor numbers in the next few years.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill under discussion, the success of the Turlough House project shows that everything does not have to be in Dublin. I am not saying that everything should be taken from Dublin, but many things can. What is wrong with <Col N="341" /> school groups coming from Athlone or Dublin to see the attractions of Mayo, such as Turlough House, the Ceide Fields and the national park that is to open soon? Such facilities add to the tourism potential of rural Ireland and help to promote counties which have not gained from the prosperity of recent years and which will suffer from the recent job losses. It is difficult for the west to gain from economic prosperity. It depends on tourism and on projects such as that in Turlough House. I am delighted it has been successful and I hope the Minister will play her part in bringing all available artefacts to County Mayo. I would love to see the artefacts that were found in the Kilbride area on display in Mayo. The Minister is a reasonable person and I know that if it can be done, she will help to play her part.</P>
    <P>I have heard many mentions of Ted Nealon, who was the first Minister with special responsibility for arts and culture that I encountered. He was good for the arts, was certainly familiar with culture and he added to these areas during his time in office. I was highly impressed with him when he came to Westport to open an arts festival. There was a time when Irish people did not think a great deal of the arts and considered it not to be something for them. It is part of our culture and we should be proud of it. We should protect our cultural assets and ensure they are free for everybody to enjoy. In the past people were turned off when they heard that an arts week was planned. However, that has changed in recent years because we have brought arts to the people. It will change further when more people go to places, such as Turlough House, and see items on display. I hope they help to preserve our heritage for the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £10 million in the Bill. Artefacts from Westport were sold at auctions in London. I hope if any of these items become available, they will be bought by the State. I hope the Minister does something about lighthouses and courthouses. I hope she talks to Jeremy Browne about the collection I mentioned to her. It is important to keep that collection in the country and to offer him support. He is a nice person and he is committed to the arts, to Westport and Westport House. He did more for tourism and Westport than Bord Fáilte, any Government or any person I know. He brought people to Westport and he put it on the map before it won the Tidy Towns competition &ndash; I was delighted it won that competition. There is a great tradition in Westport. We are proud of our town and our area. I compliment Bridie Moran and her hard working committee on winning the Tidy Towns competition. It will help tourism in Westport in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Jeremy Browne played his part in Westport over the years and he has worked against the odds to keep Westport House open. The Minister and some officials in her Department have helped him. I would love to see a public private partnership in Westport House which would help to <Col N="342" /> maintain the house and its artefacts. It is steeped in history and we should support him in whatever way we can. I hope the Minister and her officials continue to help him. If grant aid is needed, it should be made available to him. He has contacted the Heritage Council and it has been of small assistance to him.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not let me down on the issues of Turlough House and Ballycroy. The people of Ballycroy want it included in the national heritage parks. I know the Minister will look favourably on that request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me. I compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation for a variety of reasons, many of which have been mentioned by other speakers. Deputy Ring referred to the fact that the Bill will provide the Minister with the facility to ensure that works of art do not go outside the jurisdiction or that an agency, or a combination of agencies, has an opportunity to put in a bid before they are sold outside the country. If such artefacts are offered for sale outside the country, the Bill ensures that the relevant bodies will be in a position to make overtures to the seller and acquire them for the State.</P>
      <P>Much has been said on this issue in the past. The Minister replied to parliamentary questions on countless occasions and she referred to the importance of our national heritage from an educational point of view. We have a rich heritage, some of which is our own and some of which we share with our neighbours across the water. However, it is now our heritage and we should not be ashamed to do everything we can to protect it and make it available to the widest possible audience. Artefacts which are stored and which are not on public display are of little benefit to anyone. In some cases they are not preserved indefinitely. I hope the Bill allows the Minister to direct and encourage the various agencies under her guidance to identify artefacts in the marketplace for the type of displays to which Members have referred.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with <i>objet d'art</i> is that people, some of whom are unscrupulous, become involved in bidding for such items on an international basis. They seem to have endless resources and once such objects are sold on the international market it becomes difficult to track them down. Many people are now wealthy enough to have private collections and only a limited number of items are seen. They can make it difficult for anyone, a state or an individual, to intervene. Perhaps the agencies involved will draw up a register to track such items abroad and to encourage people through strictly legal means to sell them in the marketplace. People who are involved in this business will usually know where such items are likely to reappear. We must preserve and protect such items for the benefit of the country and future generations and to enable us to promote our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> Deputy Ring referred to local displays. There is nothing to beat a local centre which displays works of art relating to that area. I support the idea of displays travelling around the country on an ongoing basis where adequate security is provided. However, I strongly support local displays of art. We must ensure that heritage houses, old castles or other buildings which are natural places to house such items are maintained. Countless heritage and historical associations have access to old buildings and it is time to protect them. I encourage the Minister to provide the necessary funding as soon as possible to maintain houses or buildings which are in danger. It will be too late to do this when we are alleged to have the money. I would love to have more time to speak on this issue. I hope I have an opportunity to discuss it further at a later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill, which is innovative and long overdue. For years our finer artefacts went into private ownership and they were lost to the State forever. This legislation provides us with a great opportunity to change that. When we pass legislation, we often do not commit the funds. However, the funds are the linchpin of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify who will purchase artefacts on behalf of the State. I am concerned that if a person in Sotheby's is recognised as being from the Department, it could inflate prices. I presume the Minister will appoint an agent to act on behalf of the State to purchase artefacts. Once a State agency is involved in the purchase of anything, prices are inflated and others are encouraged to continually push the price up. This issue should be examined. A person should be able to bid on behalf of the State without the auctioneers knowing the item is being purchased for the State.</P>
      <P>A maximum of £10 million will be provided for the fund. However, if the fund is depleted and an important artefact such as a manuscript or painting becomes available, is there provision in the legislation to put the necessary funds in place at short notice rather than having to wait to provide the funds in the Department's annual Estimate? An important document could be up for sale and the fund could be depleted to the point where there is not enough in it to make the purchase. Is there provision for discretionary funding because it would be a shame if an item of historical importance was lost to the State due to a lack of funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject earlier references to the fund being Dublin-orientated. The legislation covers the National Library, the National Archives, the Chester Beatty Library, the National Concert <Col N="344" /> Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Theatre Society and the Arts Council. I come from Cork and I feel as much a part of those institutions as anybody from Dublin. It was a little disingenuous of some Members to say the legislation is Dublin-orientated. I am confident the national cultural institutions will cater for people outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Cork will be the European City of Culture in 2005 and that provides a great opportunity for international exposure. I hope the Minister will use her good offices to ensure many of the artefacts that are on display in Dublin and outside Ireland currently will be transferred to Cork for the year so that they can be viewed not only by the people of Cork and Munster but by the many foreign visitors who will visit the city that year. Plans should be put in train immediately because many of these valuable artefacts, manuscripts and paintings are booked for exhibitions and displays throughout Ireland and the world over the coming years. I hope funds will be made available to the committee co-ordinating the various events that will take place when Cork becomes the European City of Culture in 2005.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been well thought out and it contains many good provisions. The State has shied away for too long from accepting gifts from citizens because of political correctness and so on. The legislation provides that the Minister, on behalf of the State, can accept gifts of money or property from companies or individuals. This is a positive development and the making of such gifts should be encouraged. There has been a great deal of reference to the Celtic tiger and our new found wealth in recent times. The legislation provides us with an opportunity to harness that wealth to the benefit of the wider community through the purchase of artefacts of historical importance.</P>
    <P>Chronicling historical documents involves enormous expenditure. There have been references to courthouses and so on and a large number of documents is available. It takes many hours and significant resources to research and chronicle documents for display so that the public can appreciate them. Can more funding be provided to bodies engaged in such activity? There has not been enough investment in this area over many years and we often read about librarians spending hours in dark dungeons conducting endless research before a manuscript is put on public display.</P>
    <P>I have outlined a number of issues, the most important of which relates to who acts on behalf of the State at an auction, whether it is held at Sotheby's or somewhere else. No State agency gets value for money. When private sector interests become aware that the Government is interested in purchasing an item prices are automatically inflated. It would also be a shame if artefacts were lost because the Bill is not more flexible in terms of providing discretionary funding when an item of importance to the State goes on sale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Ireland has been the source of a great deal of creativity over many years and that is accepted in the literary, artistic and music worlds. The Minister supports measures that encourage artistic development and such development must be continually progressed. However, we constantly have difficulties in regard to our architectural heritage. We are falling down as a society because many of the newer buildings throughout the State are mundane and boring. Buildings are part of our culture and we will have a poor legacy in terms of the retention and construction of buildings, particularly in cities. Exciting new architectural developments should be encouraged because most buildings which have been constructed over the past 30 or 40 years have been very similar. This probably has been due to concerns about cost but people will wander through our cities in years to come and will look at what we did at the turn of the millennium to ascertain our legacy. It will not be very good and planners also have a responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that over the next few years our national cultural institutions will bear the fruit of the purchasing power provided under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members agree this is excellent legislation. Its purpose is to establish a heritage fund to enable the State's cultural institutions to acquire items on behalf of the public. There has not been such a fund previously and I am pleased the Minister has recognised the need for it and has put it on a firm legislative footing. At the risk of us slapping each other on the back, particularly those of us from the teaching profession, there has been a refinement in recent years of our understanding of our heritage across a wide range of areas and there was no better demonstration of that than when we, as a nation, honoured ten Volunteers with a State funeral recently. The teaching profession has made an enormous contribution in terms of enabling a generation of young people to understand the nature of our heritage &ndash; buildings, literature, art etc. Successive Governments have done a great deal of work and have a great deal of which to be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of heritage sites at Muckross House and gardens in Killarney, the Melon farm near Omagh and Strabane, the Ceide Fields in County Mayo and the Blasket Islands centre would not have been contemplated a number of years ago. Other Members stated that the Bill refers mainly to Dublin but a great deal of development has taken place throughout the country as a whole. Consider what has been done at Dublin Castle. Who would have thought that anybody would have the vision to restore it to its current state? Development of the Chester Beatty Library has enabled us to understand that our heritage can sit well beside the art housed there. We must also remember that Dublin Corporation is involved in restoration work at Pearse <Col N="346" /> Street library. We have a great deal of which to be proud.</P>
    <P>The Irish Folklore Commission did a tremendous amount of work during its existence. A man who lived for many years in my constituency, the late Seamus Ennis, Ciarán Mac Mathúna and others did a great deal of work in collecting material for preservation. It might be worthwhile making another attempt at asking the school-going population to write down their understanding of our heritage because it has been 50 years since their predecessors wrote down such thoughts in their copybooks which were stored away by the Irish Folklore Commission.</P>
    <P>As our awareness of heritage increases, there is greater public demand for the State to ensure that items of national importance are acquired for the people rather than being allowed to go overseas or, if they have already been removed from the country, to remain there. There are many examples of national treasures being taken out of the country in the past and the Hugh Lane collection is a case in point.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to movable heritage such as artefacts, books and works of art that are rare and that have a value of over £250,000. A key point is that these should be of national importance and I wonder who will be charged with determining this. Such artefacts do not have to be of Irish origin but I am pleased that if they are of importance to the nation or the public, they will be covered by the legislation. Acquisitions will also be significant from an education and research point of view.</P>
    <P>This is an area in respect of which adequate provision has not been made in the school curriculum. In recent years the CSPE programme in post-primary schools has broadened the curriculum and helped a great deal. In that context, I wish to refer to the Ballymun oral history project which has been ongoing in that area, in the context of its regeneration, for some time. The project is supported by FÁS, the Department and Ballymun Regeneration Limited. However, a great deal more work must be done to develop, refine and make the project user-friendly. Academic historians must consider that oral history should be given recognition and that it should not just be dealt with as &ldquo;any other business&rdquo; on the agenda of an academic council. Oral history is a more developed area of study in universities abroad than in such institutions in Ireland. It has much to offer in terms of attracting potential tourists to Ireland but I believe that, regardless of this fact, we should develop it as a discipline.</P>
    <P>A large amount of work was carried out by a FÁS supported scheme in Finglas in recent years. People are inclined to think that an area such as Finglas, which was fairly recently developed, does not have a history or heritage. However, one must consider the contribution the Craigie family made to vernacular architecture and look at the original St. Canice's church in Finglas which was founded shortly after the Normans arrived in <Col N="347" /> Ireland, the structure of which is basically intact and the grounds of which are home to a high cross. In that context, there is a need for people to appreciate what exists in places such as Finglas and, as Deputy Kelleher stated, realise that there is no need for everything to be new or for us to raze everything to the ground in our rush to redevelop.</P>
    <P>One of the saddest things I was obliged to endure as a member of Dublin Corporation occurred when we were redeveloping the area around what are now the Civic Offices. It is sad to realise that some of the old city walls are buried underneath a multi-storey car park situated behind Jury's Inn in Christchurch Place and that the only way to gain access to these is through a manhole passage which is not easy to negotiate.</P>
    <P>In developing heritage sites we must remember that they need to be accessible. People must be able to see these sites. I accept that a fair amount of scorn was poured over the empty container discovered at the base of the foundations of Nelson's Pillar, but it was important that Pat Wallace, director of the National Museum, appeared on radio and television with John Fitzgerald, the city manager, and discussed what might have been found there.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the Minister should allow some flexibility in the fund in its earliest years. If major items come to light and need to be acquired on behalf of the people, a degree of flexibility should be exercised by the Government. I am sure nobody would have difficulty agreeing to an additional Estimate for such purposes, even in the slightly difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves at present, if we were to acquire particular artefacts. Although the House has given general approval to the Bill, people are concerned that when artefacts were acquired in the past, little was heard about them. On a previous occasion I referred to the fact that some very good material from the museum was stored in Daingean, County Offaly, and that this was never seen. However, I believe the National Museum has improved its record in respect of putting items on public display.</P>
    <P>As other Members stated, there should be displays of items of historical interest throughout the country. I accept that this might lead to insurance, logistical and security difficulties, but an effort should be made to arrange such displays. The Minister will be aware, if she has seen it, that at City Hall there is a fine exhibition of some of the artefacts found during the excavations of the Wood Quay area which can be viewed by the public. That is as it should be. Such artefacts should not be kept in a totally rarefied atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which the Minister will be hearing quite soon is the Civic Museum, which is hidden away in a building in South William Street. This museum is home to some extraordinary work which has been catalogued and stored away. We are making a proposal to the Dock<Col N="348" /> lands Development Authority to try to incorporate, if possible, the Civic Museum in stack A. A museum linked to the city and located in stack A would make a great contribution in terms of enhancing the existing museum culture in the city. I hope progress can be made in this regard.</P>
    <P>The final matter to which I wish to refer is Carmichael House, which is situated beside the old Richmond Hospital in North Brunswick Street and which is a fine building. As Deputy Kelleher stated, we sometimes abuse buildings. Carmichael House is a fine example of vernacular architecture of the Victorian era and it would be a terrible shame if it was allowed to become derelict. Money is needed to secure the roof and preserve the fabric of the building and if the Minister is in a position to assist in any way we would welcome it.</P>

      <P>We have seen unprecedented levels of prosperity in the recent past in Ireland and I hope that will continue to be the case in the future. However, we are not investing realistic levels of capital into heritage, our non-renewable resource. We have libraries full of policy documents regarding our heritage, but few adequately staffed resources to implement these policies. Much of what has been done so far is too little too late.</P>
      <P>A recent survey by the Heritage Council discovered that 68% of archaeological field monuments in Wexford had been destroyed and that the county would have no field archaeology such as ring forts, raths and standing stones by 2068. My own county of Kerry is not far behind, with the loss of 49.2% of monuments in recent years. This is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Despite our prosperity we have limited funds to prevent valuable heritage objects from being sold and taken out of the State. These objects are the jewels in the crown. For every heritage item we prevent from leaving the country, how many are shipped out the back door? We do not know as in many instances there are no accurate inventories, which are the raw data regarding our heritage resource. We do not have the manpower on the ground to educate, inform and implement policy and legislation. Many people are not aware that the standing stone in an adjacent field is unique and important on a local and national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that the national architectural inventory will take 15 to 20 years to formulate a list of protected structures, much of which will be destroyed before a basic record is compiled. Through lack of awareness, education and the manpower to protect them, our architecture, works of art, archaeological sites and the landscapes within which they sit are being scattered <Col N="349" /> to the four corners of the earth. We have policies, but the Minister must provide the necessary funding for proactive rather than reactive heritage and education policies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the £10 million will be an important source of purchasing funds. The sum of £10 million seems significant, however, given that the minimum purchase will be £250,000, this would allow for only 12 purchases in 2001. Over a period the fund will allow for only 40 purchases. Given the price of a Jack. B. Yeats painting, the fund would only allow for a small number of purchases. Therefore, in the context of the prices involved, the fund will make a small, but welcome, impact.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister refer to objects which are on loan to the National Museum? A number of collections are on loan to the museum, but will the fund allow the council to purchase some of these objects?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to national treasures, such as the annals of Inishfallen, which are legitimately housed in the Bodleian Library. Will the State approach the Bodleian Library to try to negotiate a price for the annals? The Emly shrine, which I saw in the Boston Museum of Art last year, is one of the finest treasures this country could have. Will this Bill allow for reasonable prices to be offered for such treasures? The Eileen Gray furniture collection was bought from Germany and is an invaluable addition to the National Museum. I welcome the Bill, but I regret I did not have more time to speak on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>Pat Wallace is a native of west Limerick and the Minister could do the constituency much pride in enhancing the profile of the Hunt Museum in Limerick by relocating the Ardagh chalice in it. The chalice was found in Ardagh and is a national treasure which should be relocated. The community in Ardagh built up a fine mini-museum to which it hoped the chalice would be relocated, but that proposal was not entertained by the National Museum for security purposes. However, if we wish to devolve the process and give additional status to a location such as the Hunt Museum, the Minister could do worse than relocate the Ardagh chalice to it.</P>
      <P>Castles throughout the country are testament to the tremendous work being carried out by Dúchas. Desmond Castle is situated in the square in Newcastle West. In the past I contributed financially to a programme to renovate the castle. However, such locations should be allowed to serve a limited amount of wine and food during functions. The level of insurance which such bodies are compelled to have is prohibitive and such castles should be made more accessible to the public. I appreciate the Minister's concern that people may fall down steps, but I am not talking about allowing excessive drinking. I am suggesting that people should have the luxury of a glass of wine at a cheese reception. However, this is not allowed at such a location.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to this debate which gave the House an opportunity to journey around the country, speaking about the various monuments and places of interest. It is natural that Deputies should highlight heritage interests within their constituencies as we are discussing this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is specific in nature as it refers to a heritage fund. I wish to allay the fears expressed by many Deputies that this will be a Dublin-centred Bill. The legislation is nothing of the kind and I would not agree with such an approach. Representing a constituency west of the Shannon, my approach is in line with those of Deputies on all sides who believe there should be participation and access with regard to our heritage and culture, and that we must provide the best opportunity for people throughout the country to enjoy and partake of our heritage.</P>
      <P>There are many provisions within the Bill which ensure that the legislation will not be Dublin-centred. For historic reasons the national institutions have been based in Dublin. The one exception is Turlough House in County Mayo which is an important branch of the National Museum. This has been a positive development for the institution and the national institutions generally. This development also proves that I have taken the issue of cultural decentralisation seriously.</P>
      <P>The investment at Turlough House was extremely expensive at almost £15 million. However, this demonstrates the Government's commitment to the regions. The number of people who have visited the location highlights the great interest in it and that it is of the highest calibre. I thank Deputy Ring and all in Mayo for the great day of celebration and welcome we had at Turlough House.</P>
      <P>The fund will not be Dublin-centred. Deputies will be aware that there are designated museums. Eight county museums have been designated under the National Cultural Institutions Act which means they have reached a particular standard. I will announce a further two such designations shortly. These museums are recognised as being of the highest standards in terms of environmental conditions and security, and there is an opportunity for a lending programme between the national institutions and these museums. In fairness to it, the National Museum, and other national institutions, have looked upon this issue favourably and the National Museum has operated a lending policy for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill refers to moveable heritage, the definition of which was the cause of some concern to a number of Deputies who queried whether this was clear in the legislation. The Bill is clear on this issue as it refers to the fact that a moveable object is a moveable heritage object and is an artefact. It refers to any object or collection of objects, including archaeological objects and objects relating to the decorative arts, natural sciences, history, industry or folkways, any book or <Col N="351" /> any manuscript, other material or part thereof, copyright and any work or any similar object or material. It is a wide and comprehensive definition. There should be no difficulty with the definition in this Bill as it is quite clear.</P>
    <P>In regard to the emphasis on giving the opportunity to the regions to partake in and enhance our culture, I am very proud that this Government has allocated £36 million to me. I asked specifically for this money so that we would be able to have what is known as the Access programme. Under the Access programme, we will have no less than 44 projects which will be up and running or the position of which will be improved thanks to that fund. Some £2.3 million has been allocated in principle to Sligo County Museum. Lismore Heritage Centre Museum in County Waterford has been allocated £110,000, Wexford County Museum has been allocated £1.3 million and the Civic Museum at Spanish Arch in Galway has been allocated £2.4 million.</P>
    <P>The question was asked as to why the Council of Cultural Institutions would be the body, vehicle or channel used in this case. The reason is that these people are the experts. We are talking about the directors of our national institutions. It is a pool of tremendous knowledge and experience and they will have that expert knowledge which will benefit the people generally in terms of advising and being able to work this fund.</P>
    <P>I was rather puzzled that the heritage fund was referred to as partitionist, although, in fairness, this was mentioned by only one Deputy opposite. Artefacts which may have originated in the North may be purchased from the heritage fund on the recommendation of the Council of Cultural Institutions and subject to my agreement. That situation would pertain so I do not understand that accusation.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to me by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge &ndash; Deputy O'Shea referred to this. When initiating this Bill, I said I was looking at the proposals being put forward. I said that before Committee Stage, I wanted to see the reports and accounts in both Irish and English. Between now and Committee Stage, I will look at the further proposals put forward by comhdháil.</P>
    <P>I refer to the reason there is a £250,000 threshold. This is a very important point and is crucial to this Bill. We are not talking about doing away with the acquisition funds that already exist and have been approved over the years in our national institutions. This is an additional fund. We are talking about an artefact of extreme national importance and significance, something very precious indeed, which would be very difficult for any of the national institutions to acquire. This is an additional fund and the national institutions will still have their own obligations and responsibilities in acquiring different artefacts. That is acknowledged. The reason for the £250,000 threshold is to make the point that an <Col N="352" /> artefact is of particular interest to the country and that it would be best that it remain at home.</P>
    <P>I refer to the £10 million. We are talking about £3 million over a three year period. The money does not have to be expended straight away &ndash; there can be a rollover. It does not mean everything that is likely to come to auction will be of that calibre and will not already be on the list of acquisitions or potential acquisitions of the national institutions. This will be reviewed because, as we know, the situation is ongoing and changing. It is a new approach. We will look at the operation of the fund and it will be reviewed annually. The review will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so there will be an opportunity for Members to express their views.</P>
    <P>The issue of record keeping and archives was raised. Deputy O'Shea asked about the position of the proposed public private partnership and the National Archives. The last day we discussed this matter in the House I said the go ahead had been given for the public private partnership by the Department of Finance and that we were talking about a very expensive proposal because it would be a very comprehensive one in terms of the new archives. The public private partnership has been sanctioned by the Department of Finance. The PPP approach is being examined by the Office of Public Works which is drawing up the contract and tender documents. If we are to have more new buildings and space, we will need staffing. At my intervention, seven new posts were sanctioned by the Department of Finance for the National Archives and some of those posts have been filled.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues arose during the debate. The battle sites have not been protected and I will look at this in the context of the National Monuments Acts. I agree with Deputies that this issue must be looked at and the best possible way to do so is in the context of the national monuments proposals which I will publish shortly.</P>
    <P>A number of references were made to our architecture and national monuments which do not come under the remit of this Bill. Given that they have been referred to, I will refer very briefly to them. Some 120,000 monuments are listed in the record of monuments and places. They are afforded protection under the National Monuments Act. Over 740 of those are in State care. I emphasise that over the past four and a half years since I have been given responsibility in this Department, I have ensured that there have been increases for the Heritage Council. We have given additional moneys for listed buildings at risk. Under the national development plan, I announced the allocation of £100 million and that we would see what we could do in regard to our monuments because they are of great interest and are very precious. A national inventory of architectural heritage has been initiated. Although it will take 12 years, if this legislation had not been introduced, we would have had to wait for over <Col N="353" /> 40 years for this work to be completed. That puts it into perspective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring and other Deputies said they would like to see artefacts in other centres throughout the country &ndash; I referred to that. Education is of importance and I will talk to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. We, in our Department, do what we can through our visitor services. I refer to Deputy Pat Carey's interest in the Irish Folklore Commission. It is one of the reasons I have supported what is known as the women's history project. I will make some statements very soon in regard to the oral history project which should be of interest to Members.</P>
    <P>This has been a very positive debate and I thank all Members for their kind words. This legislation will be of tremendous help not only to our national institutions. This fund will build up over five years, not three, as I said earlier, and there will be an opportunity on a yearly basis to review it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> and calls on the Taoiseach to remove the Minister for Public Enterprise from her current office.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Quinn and Sargent. It gives me no satisfaction that the immediate target of our debate this evening is the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. I have no hesitation in beginning my remarks by acknowledging that she is a member of an Irish political family which has given three generations of service to the State.</P>
    <P>This motion deals with mismanagement and incompetence across a number of areas for which the Minister for Public Enterprise has primary responsibility. However, the real responsibility for the incompetence and mismanagement goes far beyond her. It starts and ends with the Taoiseach. He has presided over it. He has been prepared to do nothing about it, even when confronted with the disastrous or near collapse of the State sponsored companies for which the Minister has responsibility. The responsibility is also shared by the Government as a whole which has not only tolerated the mismanagement and incompetence in the Department of Public Enterprise, but has, by its actions and inaction, contributed to it.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe now, but there were days when the very mention of State sponsored companies such as Aer Lingus, CIE and Aer Rianta evoked a sense of pride and achievement among Irish people at home and abroad. That sense of pride, sadly, has gone. The sense of achievement is gone. They are gone, not because of the workers who continue to show commitment and dedication even when the odds are stacked against them, but all has been lost because of Government incompetence and mismanagement. The Government's shareholder representative is the Minister for Public Enterprise. Never has a Minister been more inappropriately titled. She has stifled enterprise, meddled where she did not belong, failed to give direction when appropriate and floundered, flustered and blustered when faced with criticisms of her performance.</P>
    <P>The mismanagement and incompetence have taken many forms. The Minister has been indecisive, failed to deliver, presided over major cost overruns, sometimes managed to achieve the exact opposite to what she intended, served sectional interests and ignored the future while pandering to short-term needs. However, even she could not have achieved all this on her own. She has had a massive helping hand from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>Is it not somewhat bizarre that the Government has, for the first time in the history of the State, two Ministers whose titles include the word &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo;, one of whom deals with enterprise, the other with public enterprise? Yet, never has a Government been less enterprising. Never has <Col N="356" /> economic success been so incompetently managed. This incompetent Government has squandered our boom.</P>
    <P>Let me look briefly at a selection of the disasters over which the Minister has presided. I want to deal with Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Luas and the railways. I begin with Aer Lingus whose very future as a national airline is now threatened. With the collapse of Swissair and Sabena we see how quickly and dramatically things can change in the aviation industry. The problems of Aer Lingus, however, did not begin on 11 September, nor did they begin with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease earlier this year. The problems of Aer Lingus began when the Minister took up her appointment almost four years and six months ago.</P>
    <P>Let us remember the situation she inherited. Passenger numbers in and out of Ireland were never higher, Aer Lingus was massively profitable and the then Minister, Deputy Alan Dukes, mandated its board to explore the possibilities of the airline entering a strategic alliance, with or without the transfer of equity, and submit proposals to the Minister as shareholder. What did the Minister for Public Enterprise do? She had no consistent or clear policy. At various stages she favoured strategic alliances, the sale of the entire Government shareholding and the sale of less than 50% of the Government shareholding. She also flip-flopped on Government aid. Initially it was ruled out; then it was ruled in, provided the European Union agreed. She came to the House and asked us to enact the Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, which provided the legislative framework for an initial public offering. She appointed the necessary advisers and committed the Government to the same high fees she had already paid in the case of Eircom, but she wrecked any real possibility of a successful IPO by saying that she would, &ldquo;follow the Eircom model&rdquo;, a model which had already left almost 500,000 Irish people suffering serious financial loss. Did she seriously believe that anyone would ever again invest their hard earned money in anything in which she was involved after that disaster?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most humiliating episode in the sorry Aer Lingus saga was the attempt made by the Minister, and personally by the Taoiseach, to persuade the European Commission to be helpful. I cannot recall any occasion since we joined the European Union almost 30 years ago where an Irish approach was so glaringly and decisively rejected. This can hardly have come as a huge surprise when one remembers how arrogantly and insensitively the Minister for Finance, with the backing of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, gave Brussels the two fingers when it sought to bring us into line with European economic policy. Why should Brussels play ball on any issue with an Irish Government which so publicly, repeatedly and arrogantly refused to co-operate on overall economic policy? </P>
    <P>Let us also remember the damage done to our reputation in Europe by the extraordinary <Col N="357" /> cronyism in attempting to appoint Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to a European institution. The Tánaiste may think that nobody would remember that after a few weeks, as she once infamously said. The powers that be in Brussels still remember it and Ireland continues to pay the price.</P>
    <P>The failure of Aer Lingus is not simply a failure on the part of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. It is a failure on the part of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. It is a stark illustration of Government incompetence and mismanagement. So much for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Let us look briefly at Aer Rianta. Anyone who has used Dublin Airport recently will understand why it has been ranked number 39 of 48 airports surveyed by the International Air Transport Association. What did the Minister set out to do when she was appointed? She said she wanted to preside over the development of Dublin Airport so that it would become a first class facility with the potential to become a European hub airport. In the four and a half years that she has been in office, she has presided over a slide into chaos and Aer Rianta is in dispute with most of its customers. It does not know whether the Minister will allow competition at the airport. It does not know whether she will allow a new terminal to be built by someone other than Aer Rianta. In general, it is facing the same uncertainty that has brought Aer Lingus to its knees.</P>
    <P>I will give a small but extraordinary example of Aer Rianta's current activities outside Dublin. For many years, Aer Rianta has provided catering for the castles in County Clare, whose flagship is Bunratty Castle. These banquets have been, and should be for the future, one of the main tourist attractions in the mid-west, especially for the American market, but what happens when the cold winds blow through tourism, particularly from the United States? Aer Rianta announces that it is pulling out of the catering contract by the end of the year and the castles will have to find somebody else to do the job. This was a profitable activity from which Aer Rianta made £250,000 a year. This is like bowing to some kind of ideological god in the consultancy world who says that Aer Rianta should pull out of all core activity. Since Deputy Healy-Rae stopped it from pulling out of the hotels in Parknasilla, Killarney and elsewhere, it decided to pull out of catering at Bunratty Castle, despite making a profit.</P>
    <P>This is Aer Rianta as presided over by Fianna Fáil which has always said that it does not want to give foreign airlines too much access to Shannon Airport because they are inclined to reduce or eliminate their services when times get bad. What happens now, however, when times are bad? Aer Rianta, of which the Government is the sole shareholder, decides to pull out of the major tourism activity in the region. How can the Government expect the private sector to maintain the tourism sector if the first thing it does when things get rough is pull out of profitable enterprises? If the Minister has any interest in the mid-west, she <Col N="358" /> should do something about this issue before it is too late.</P>
    <P>When the rainbow Government left office in June 1997, there was a ready-to-roll, fully costed and EU supported plan for Luas. If it had been followed, the hard-pressed people of Dublin would now be travelling on the Luas system. A similar scheme in Montpellier in France, the planning for which started at the same time as Dublin, is already up and running. The people of that French city can now travel to and from work on their light rail system. The Minister, however, could not leave well enough alone. For no reason, other than it was a rainbow Government project, she decided that it had to be reviewed, looked at by consultants and, in her own memorable term, &ldquo;re-energised&rdquo;. The end result is plain for all to see. The only yard of track laid after four and a half years has been the toy track on Merrion Square, the latest political gimmick by a desperate Government. In the process, incidentally, hundreds of people were deprived of parking spaces and traffic congestion in the area has increased. Thank God it is being removed today. If the Minister wants to play with toy trains, she should invest in a good set and play with them at home, or write to Santa Claus.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, we have no Luas and Dublin's gridlock gets worse every day. This is another example of incompetence and mismanagement by the Government, in particular, by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the subsequent joint Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government were very specific. They undertook to develop high-speed inter-city rail services and to introduce integrated ticketing between bus, DART, rail and Luas in the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This was not just the Fianna Fáil manifesto, we are used to whoppers in that, it was transferred to the programme for Government. It also undertook to expand rail services in Cork by re-opening the Cork-Midleton-Youghal line, adding new commuter stations on the north side of Cork, and lastly to provide a rail link to Dublin Airport as a matter of extreme urgency. These commitments were made by the Government four and a half years ago when it took office, but not one of them has been honoured. As the Government prepares to face the electorate, the commitments now seem so remote that they are the subject of ridicule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality, reliability and popularity of rail transport have declined over the past four years. The Government has produced five separate blueprints for a new transport system for the Dublin area, but no action. It is typical of the <Col N="359" /> Government. Commuters criticise the traffic problems in voxpops on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, so a blueprint is produced. When it recurs six months later the Government says, &ldquo;Let's have another blueprint&rdquo;. When the issue is raised in the Dáil, the Minister goes to Cabinet and we have another blueprint. We have had five transport blueprints for Dublin in the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>Because of the sensitive personal issues involved, I will refrain from going into detail of the Minister's handling, in her capacity as shareholder representative, of the relationship with CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to saying that, yet again, we have witnessed a most extraordinary example of Government mismanagement and incompetence. The fault lies not just with the Minister for Public Enterprise but with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole. What I have talked about represents lamentable failure, incompetence and mismanagement. Above all, however, it represents a failure of leadership because at the end of the day, the buck stops with the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach is not a foolish man. He knows there has been incompetence on a massive scale but he has failed to deal with it and must now face the consequences either in this House or at the forthcoming general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the public's perception about the adversarial nature of politics, motions of no confidence in Ministers are a rare enough occurrence. Motions of no confidence signed by the three largest Opposition parties are rarer still, but on this occasion the time has come to say stop. The stakes are too high to allow the Minister to continue in office. Of course, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is not fully responsible for her own woes. She serves as Minister for Public Enterprise in a Government that is ideologically hostile to public enterprise. Her charge was to render her Department redundant but thankfully in that she has failed too.</P>
      <P>In fairness to her, the Minister has faced a number of particular difficulties. She serves with a Taoiseach more interested in having his photo taken with the Luas than in getting it up and running on the streets of Dublin. The Taoiseach is largely responsible for the Minister's woes. He has primary responsibility for implementation of the national development plan. His indifference in doing the work and in driving the projects along, making enemies and friends in the process, is not inconsiderable. He has handed over the levers of power in the Government to the ideological clique of the Ministers, Deputies McCreevy and Harney, and the Attorney General, Mr. McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> All this, however, cannot excuse the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who has been, sadly, out of her depth for some time. Her failure to deliver even a modicum of improvement, particularly in the area of transport is not just impacting upon the quality of the lives of all our citizens, it is also undermining our capacity for future economic growth and sustained competitiveness. In the future we may all be the poorer for the Minister's failures.</P>
    <P>It is a testament to the Minister's failure, for example, that the Labour Party website is being hosted from the United States, not Westport as was originally the case, due to our growing infrastructural deficit. This Government has made great play of its support for regional development. Schemes and formulas have been concocted to ensure maximum economic support from Brussels but when it comes to the simple task of delivering the goods at home, the Minister and this Government are simply not up to it. In the area of ensuring adequate broadband development on a nationwide basis, the failure has been total.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the handling of the crisis in Aer Lingus represents the straw that has broken the camel's back for the Opposition in respect of this particular Minister's record. On this issue, in particular, the Government's record has been shameful. It has not just been incompetent, it has been dishonest and deeply unfair to the 2,000 plus workers whose jobs are on the line at the airline.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the Government is conspiring to push the airline to the brink of collapse. Since the crisis in Aer Lingus broke it has done nothing really effective to assist the company. In all of this the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has been the Taoiseach's patsy. The crisis in Aer Lingus is not being treated as a potential disaster for north County Dublin and Limerick but as a means to pursue the Government's chosen policy of offloading the airline. So intent is the Government on offloading the airline that it is quite prepared to make a bogeyman of the European Commission and the European Union to do so.</P>
    <P>The State cannot invest in this airline we are told because the European Union will not let us. We cannot secure decent redundancy packages for workers who may have to leave the company because the European Commission will not let us. The European Union is to be this Government's fall guy for its failure to tackle the problems at Aer Lingus. It is a lie and there is no other way of putting it. Ireland has no formal application of any kind to invest in Aer Lingus before the European Commission. We are not looking for permission to invest in a viable airline. Europe exists solely as the Government's smokescreen for doing absolutely nothing, not yet anyway.</P>
    <P>When journalists inquire about what is going on they are told by the Government that the issue of State aid is not entirely dead. They are told that discussions are ongoing and that the Com<Col N="361" /> mission's so called decision on State aid is final, for now at least. On what basis are discussions ongoing? Why would the Government be discussing something it claims the European Commission has already refused? Could it be that the Government wants to sap any remaining morale in the Aer Lingus workforce before seeking to pull a rabbit out of the hat? I fear that might be the case. It is very cynical but we have come to expect that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>We are being told of course that the Commission has decided on a narrow interpretation of Article 87 by confining aid to airlines arising from the atrocities of 11 September to just flights cancelled directly as a result of it for the four days immediately following the atrocity. This is true but in my view the Commission is wrong and the Government should legally challenge this decision. What we have got instead is huffing and puffing not action.</P>
    <P>The State, as shareholder in Aer Lingus, is entitled to invest in a viable Aer Lingus. I believe the European Commission would be open to considering such a plan but the Commission cannot consider what it has not got before it and it is an act of national sabotage for the Government to pretend that all approaches have been explored exhaustively.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Government seems more comfortable talking tough with Aer Lingus workers than it is with Europe and that is no accident. Government spin doctors continue to keep the workers and their representatives under pressure with stories about the airline's closure. At a time of absolute crisis for thousands of Aer Lingus workers the Taoiseach who talks a great game about social partnership is prepared to abandon any semblance of it to adopt the tactics of the bully boy. Despite the protestations to the contrary Michael O'Leary clearly has some admirers in this Government.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to fathom who exactly is behind the Government's agenda. It may be the Minister, it may not. It is difficult to imagine that she would be behind her personal political humiliation of ruling the privatisation of Aer Lingus out one week and then being forced to publicly announce it the following week. If the Minister is not directly at fault, she is clearly not capable of taking on the culprits and consequently her continuation in office is the greatest threat to the long-term viability of Aer Lingus. On this issue and this issue alone, a Cheann Comhairle, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, should do the decent thing and resign from office.</P>
    <P>Her other failures stand as a checklist of some of the greatest problems facing our society. Her unveiling of a Luas carriage on Sunday last stands as a sick joke on the people of Dublin. Nothing was more pathetic than the reality of it and nothing was more pathetic than the Minister's speech and the fact that the Taoiseach had to hide behind the cabin and not come out for the photo opportunity so elaborately prepared for him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> Her failure to drive this project, or any alternative, since coming to office is at the heart of Dublin's transport chaos. As Minister she has stood idly by while Dublin's problems have been transported to every urban centre in the country. As Deputy Noonan said, there was a solution on her desk when she came into office but she refused, for whatever reason, to activate that and through interference, messing and meddling she has successfully delayed the implementation of the Luas project that is so needed in this city.</P>
    <P>Her one size fits all solution &ndash; privatisation &ndash; is to be extended to our State bus companies as well. Thankfully it has not happened. It would appear that once this Minister has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the future of a semi-State company she is then happy to disengage. She is intent on applying the Aer Lingus formula to other semi-State companies, such as the Great Southern Hotels, possibly with the same effect.</P>
    <P>Her obsession with flotations, one would think, might have been diminished by her experiences at Telecom. In fact, if there is one thing this Government is doing well it is using taxpayers' money to sell itself and its plans. At the moment taxpayers' money is being used to sell under-performing Ministers to boost their re-election plans. Three years ago it was used to sell the Telecom flotation. For those in the know, the get in and get out quick brigade, this was manna from heaven, money for those who already had it &ndash; another thing this Government excels at. For the rest it was a disaster and their final humiliation is dealing with a forced fire sale of their shares to Valentia.</P>
    <P>This motion sets out 15 failures, another 15 failures of a Government Minister. All of them are critical to our future economic prosperity. It will be the sad legacy of this Government that the four most prosperous years in the history of the State have coincided with its most under-achieving Government. But in terms of under-achievement, the Minister for Public Enterprise has been to the fore. In fact, she has excelled herself. The public simply cannot afford to see her continue in office. Aer Lingus certainly cannot afford to see her continue in office.</P>
    <P>I concede that the motion before the House is an optimistic one. It calls on the Taoiseach to take a decision in the national interest. In his four and a half years in office, and despite being faced with many similar questions, it is a challenge he has never risen to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>This three party motion supported by the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, is timely. I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is, from a personal point of view, a very charming person. This is certainly not a personalised attack so there is no room for charm in the contributions. It is both an objective assessment but also a very subjective one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of the unfortunate suburban rail passengers who daily witness fainting on our suburban trains. It is a phenomenon unique to our <Col N="363" /> rail system that passengers do not fall when they faint because they do not have room to do so. Windows on suburban trains are often locked, probably because trains stand outside overnight. There is an inhumane side to the running of our public transport system for which the Minister must take responsibility.</P>
    <P>When discussions on the national development plan began in 1998 the Minister for Public Enterprise said we were heralding a golden age of rail. We have waited with bated breath for this to come about. Meanwhile, the National Roads Authority, realising that the Minister and CIE were asleep, has managed to bag 750 kilometres of new motorway while the Minister boasts a mere 23 kilometres of railway, some of it a sham public relations stunt, and some safety work. Our railways are experiencing a continual sunset, not a golden age. As the Kingscourt line is now closed, we have a net loss of railway.</P>
    <P>With Treasury Holdings, Córas Iompair Éireann owns land at Spencer Dock, but so little is its interest in public transport that it failed to include a public transport link in its proposed development. The new plans coming forward for a rail link from Cork through Ennis and Galway to Derry, with a spur to Shannon, make wonderful public relations, but the money to finance these proposals has passed us by and we are left with the hollow ring of PR announcements and without delivery on the ground.</P>
    <P>The platform for change plan needs an additional £4.3 billion. Has the Department of Public Enterprise received a commitment for this money and from where will it come? Are we to repeat the charade of last Sunday's Luas photo opportunity again and again? We are facing the prospect of a public transport system which moves at walking pace.</P>
    <P>CIE's practices do not come up to international standards. Its passenger charter declares that a train is not considered late if it arrives within 15 minutes of the published time. Is this an acceptable standard?</P>
    <P>Well respected economists writing in business journals not averse to privatisation have warned the Government to think again before trusting our transport system to private enterprise. A leading economist says the latest turn in the Eircom saga highlights the &ldquo;blatant stupidity of the market liberalisation and privatisation pursued by successive Governments&rdquo;. The first mistake was to issue the initial mobile phone licence at the ludicrously low price of £15 million. This was granted to Denis O'Brien's Esat group and was undoubtedly a licence to print money. That licence accounted for a large proportion of the £2 billion plus paid by BT for the Esat group in early 2000. The mistake has been repeated with the issue of further mobile phone licences. It appears that when the Minister cannot make something work her solution is to privatise it. By following this policy she merely makes a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> In the energy sector many despair of the Minister's lack of imagination and planning with regard to the energy needs of the country. The Irish Wind Energy Assocation, which depends on the Minister for regulations to allow it to develop to its full potential, has stated that Ireland could generate 25% of its electricity from wind with no increase in electricity prices to the consumer. If this was done, there would be wind turbines on only 0.5% of the country, assuming no offshore development which has huge potential in itself. Thousands of new jobs would be created in manufacturing and research and we would be able to avoid large impending EU pollution penalties. We urgently need a proper national plan to develop this resource. The Minister must realise that the work being done in the development of wind energy falls far short of what is needed. It is her responsibility to ensure we do not have further shortages of energy as we approach winter.</P>
    <P>Is it because of local political considerations that the Minister appears to have a fixation with peat extraction and peat fired generating stations? This is a short-term and costly policy, particularly when wind energy is being neglected. In 1999 a judgment was made against Ireland regarding peat extraction. The Minister claims to be law abiding with regard to EU rules as they apply to Aer Lingus, but is she happy that Bord na Móna continues to breach the 1999 judgment by extracting an area greater than 50 hectares without an environmental impact study? It increases the level of anger among workers in Aer Lingus to hear that the Minister is happy to allow breaches of EU law in another area. That anger is deepened by her singular failure to drive home the case for exceptional State aid for Aer Lingus, which is allowed for under EU rules. As a transatlantic air service, Aer Lingus has a particular case. It is clear to me and to workers in Aer Lingus, many of whom are in my constituency of Dublin North, that the Minister is not pursuing this case to the extent possible. She must take legal action and be defiant in her approach to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Workers in other export industries are also angry and fearful at the failure of the Government to make a stand. The collapse of Aer Lingus would affect the export capacity of businesses located in Ireland which depend on transatlantic flights out of Dublin and Shannon.</P>
    <P>I do not focus merely on the responsibilities of the Minister for Public Enterprise. I also sound a clear warning that unless the Minister either changes radically or moves on, we will be left with a litany of disasters in the Department of Public Enterprise with problems in many companies in the public and private sectors. The Aer Lingus crisis is endangering the jobs of employees in various companies who have reason to be very afraid while the Minister remains in office. This is a <Col N="365" /> serious motion and its outcome is important for many.</P>

    <P>Mrs. O'Rourke: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;commends the Minister for Public Enterprise on her substantial record of achievement in building a secure platform for sustainable development in each of the pivotal infrastructural sectors of transport, energy and communications over the past four years and in particular:</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the progress being made to ensure Aer Lingus has a secure future and the Government's efforts to maintain the maximum number of sustainable jobs;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the significant investment in new facilities at the State airports and in financial support for the regional airports over the past four years;</P>
    <P>&ndash;commends the Minister for ensuring the future of the railway network after so many years of low investment and the securing of Government approval for a five year £430 million railway safety programme;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the unprecedented levels of capital and current funding for public transport;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the improvements to Dublin public transport, including the upgrading and extension of the DART system and the introduction of almost three hundred new buses in recent years;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that Luas has obtained light railway orders for its core routes in west and south Dublin and that construction is under way and on schedule for completion by the stated target date of October 2003;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the appointment of the telecommunications regulator by the previous rainbow coalition Government and the appointment of electricity and aviation regulators by this Government;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that, as a result of EU directives and national legislation, power generation is a fully liberalised activity licensed by the Commission for Electricity Regulation;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that an investment programme of record proportions in the transmission grid is under way and will bring the electricity infrastructure up to international standards;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the contribution that developments in sustainable energy are making to minimising CO*2 emissions;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" />&ndash;recognises the Minister's strong commitment in implementing the Government's campaign for bringing about the closure of Sellafield and supports the Government's current legal actions against the UK Government in regard to the Sellafield MOX plant;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the unprecedented level of investment in natural gas infrastructure that will bring both Corrib and imported gas to many new areas of the country as well as to existing customers;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that full liberalisation of the telecommunications market was achieved by 1999, ahead of target, and</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the initiatives undertaken by the Minister for Public Enterprise in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and in promoting the development of broadband communications networks in the regions.</P>
    <P>I thank the Opposition for their contribution to this motion but I am sorry that Deputy Noonan has left the Chamber. I wish to share my time with the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea. I trust that is in order.</P>
    <P>There was an era when Private Members' time in this House was used as a vehicle to advance the Opposition's policy platform. That was when the time was used to debate Private Members' Bills or policies drafted and published by the Opposition, but that time has long gone. For Private Members' time to be used constructively it is necessary to have an Opposition with something constructive to contribute. This is not such an Opposition. It is an Opposition without courage or vision, it is indolent and led by lazy leaders. It is a soft option Opposition which is prepared to criticise the proposals of others but has no policy of its own.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Opposition is unable to suggest solutions and engages in unfocused criticism. I do not know whether the lack of motivation and focus in Fine Gael is the result of their in-fighting and internal intrigue or disillusionment and despair, but it is palpable. If Fine Gael spent half as much time developing policies as it did soliciting and concealing offshore donations and evading tax, lazy motions like this would never see the light of day. Deputy Noonan is inert, inactive and unable. He appears to have exhausted himself in the course of the relentless whispering campaign he conducted against his former leader. For a man so active and agile while in the shadows, it is sad to see his sloth in sunlight. He was lively when he was plotting to get rid of Deputy John Bruton and sacking the old front bench.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>But when he got the job he became listless and lazy. It is a curious logic &ndash; perhaps unique to Fine Gael &ndash; that Deputy Bruton had to go because he was unpopular, but Deputy Noonan must stay because he is more unpopular. From the Government benches it is possible to see beyond Deputy Noonan. It is possible to see the cringing faces of the newly demoted &ndash; and those of the yet to be promoted &ndash; as he unleashes yet another tortured cliché. It is possible to see the wasted generations of Fine Gael who still wonder why it is 19 years since the people chose Fine Gael to lead a Government after a general election. The answer is slowly dawning &ndash; the answer is Deputy Noonan. The people have had enough of the politics of finger-pointing, the politics of carping criticism and the politics of relentless negativism. They want a Government which is united and decisive. Deputy Noonan will never lead such a Government.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Leader is no more than a collection of clichés which are worn, tired and tortured. Tonight he has called for my resignation. I will be here long after those who now sit behind and whisper about Deputy Noonan have sent him off. This motion is as predictable as it is lazy. It is a product of the feet-on the-desk and the head back school of politics. It is a symptom of &ldquo;the anything will do because we're going to give the same speech anyway&rdquo; approach. It comes from parties with nothing new to say who tonight have formed a lazy alliance in the hope that it passes for coherent opposition.</P>
      <P>The leadership of Fine Gael is lazy, but at least they have a leader. That is more than can be said for the Labour Party. It is utterly leaderless. Nobody knows what their leader stands for but everybody knows what he is against.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have attached the real record of progress across the divisions in my Department. If there is one thing I hate it is cowardice. Deputies Noonan <Col N="369" /> and Quinn hightailed it out of Dáil Éireann tonight because they could not bear to hear the truth about themselves. I now formally challenge the three Opposition Leaders, or their party spokespersons, to debate my record in office in any forum. I could spend hours going through all the detail but I will pinpoint a number of areas where this Government and my Department have made a real and enduring difference since 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government has spent £1.536 billion on improving public transport. Government subvention to CIE has risen by 60% since 1996; the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, progressively reduced the subvention in his three budgets. Government capital expenditure on public transport has risen by almost 700%&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;38 new DART carriages have been delivered and 20 new diesel railcars are in operation. The full Luas fleet of 40 trams are on the way. Dublin Bus has had 375 new buses delivered up until last year &ndash; the previous Government did not purchase even one bus in three years &ndash; and a further 141 buses are on the way between now and next year. Bus Éireann has had 148 new buses delivered with an additional 70 this year. Deputy Sargent should note that 229 miles of rail track have been renewed costing £500 million.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael and Labour left the railway system in a criminal state. Luas will commence in 2003, metro planning proposals are due to reach Government before Christmas.</P>
      <P>As regards broadband, £107 million has been provided to bring broadband to the regions which will leverage an additional £300 million from the private sector. The Government provided £60 million to encourage the global crossing international connectivity project to Ireland. Planning is well advanced on the Atlantic broadband corridor which will provide high speed links down the western seaboard between Donegal and Cork.</P>

Some 31% of the electricity market has been opened to competition with a further 40% opening next February, followed by full opening in February 2005. Markets for green electricity and combined heat and power &ndash; CHP &ndash; plants have been fully liberalised. Two major power plants providing 800 megawatts of power will come on stream in the first half of next year. Spending so far on sustainable energy projects is in excess of £15 million. The Commission for Electricity Regulation and Eirgrid have been established. The Government has finalised legal actions under the Law <Col N="370" /> of the Sea and the OSPAR Convention against Sellafield.</P>

He was at pains to point out that he had intimate knowledge of the importance of the airport to our region. So intimate was this knowledge that the Fine Gael MEP for Connacht-Ulster, Joe McCartan, was at the same time making a strong case in Strasbourg for scrapping the Shannon stopover, stating that the liberalisation of transatlantic services would benefit the economy of the west. We should not be too despondent. I am sure Deputy Jim Mitchell's delegation to EU headquarters has been equally impressive in convincing Aer Lingus workers that saying one thing in the Dáil and on the doorsteps of Dublin North and another in Strasbourg&mdash;</P>

I am sure the same workers will be heartened to know that Fine Gael's Deputy Richard Bruton was fighting their corner at the EU table as part of the Mitchell-led delegation.

    <P>The crocodile tears that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are shedding tonight for the plight of Aer Lingus workers are in stark contrast to their behaviour at the time of the Irish Shipping crisis. I still remember the sheer staggering incompetence with which the matter was dealt by the person who ironically recently led the Fine Gael delegation to the European Union, Deputy Jim Mitchell. Such was the incompetence, the lack of leadership and direction that the Government of the day finished up by liquidating this once proud Irish company which was as much a badge of our <Col N="374" /> statehood as Aer Lingus, for which the Opposition is shedding so many crocodile tears. The Government of the day finished up by selling Irish Shipping down the tubes, destroying it for a significantly greater price than what it would have cost the Government to save it, because Deputy Jim Mitchell bungled the figures. One statement contradicted another and finally when the real figures were revealed they contradicted all Deputy Mitchell's previous contradictory statements. More importantly, we remember not just the incompetence, but the callousness, the harshness, the coldness towards those who had spent their lives working in Irish Shipping.</P>

      <P>Anyone looking to be convinced about Deputy Michael Noonan's inability to comprehend and respond to serious national issues such as Aer Lingus needs no further evidence when they consider his call at Shannon Airport for the removal of what he called the political friends of Fianna Fáil from the board of Aer Lingus as his solution to the problems it was facing. Could this be the same Deputy Michael Noonan who raised political patronage to the level of an art form? Could this be the same Deputy Michael Noonan who served as a Minister at the same time in 1996 when the late Fine Gael fund raiser, Mr. David Austin, was appointed to none other than the board of Aer Lingus? He came in through the Lowry connection, but, of course, the Opposition knows nothing about that now. If Deputy Michael Noonan really believes the removal of political appointees from State boards is the key to improving their performance, then I would welcome his views on those of my constituents, well-known Fine Gael activists, whom he appointed to the Irish Medicines Board, the Irish Medicines Advisory Board, the VHI and every other sort of board and quango. Nothing was too big or too small. The only qualification was to be a Fine Gael supporter. I am sure every recruitment agency in this country will be queuing up to offer Deputy Michael Noonan a job after the next general election when he has retired as leader of Fine Gael, such is his expertise in finding jobs for his friends.</P>
      <P>No wonder Fine Gael lost the 1997 general election; half its time in government was spent finding jobs on State boards for party workers and friends of old and trawling for hacks to fill such boards. Anyone who ever voted for Fine Gael nearly met the qualifying condition for appointment. If there was only one vacancy on the blood board and Dracula was the only Fine Gael supporter&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil has made significant progress to secure the future of Aer Lingus and maintain the maximum number of sustainable jobs. We have agreed a £40 million redundancy package which takes account of redundancy costs and terms for 2,026 employees of the company. I commend my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for her part in ensuring this package will result in redundancy payments eight to ten times greater than statutory payments. Early retirement will be made available to pilots over the age of 48 years and <i>ex gratia</i> payments of £50,000, subject to a minimum of 20 years completed company service, will be paid. Job losses are never the best option, but lip-service in making a political football out of the lives of those who deserve leadership is a very poor alternative.</P>

I will not hoodwink those whose livelihood depends on it. I have no intention of taking political lectures from Fine Gael. One must look at the credibility and performance when in office of those making the criticisms. When it comes to swallowing principles it is well known that Fine Gael has the digestive system of an ostrich. I will not listen to lectures about the political competence of my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, especially when those criticisms come from people who, when they had the stewardship of the State, were the greatest job and investment destroyers in this country since the days of the Great Famine.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Gilmore, Naughten and Stanton.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House is particularly timely and appropriate. It seeks the removal from office of arguably the worst Minister with responsibility for public enterprise in the history of the State. Never before has a Minister made such an almighty mess of a Department and the companies for which it has responsibility. After four and a half years, what does the Minister have to show for her tenure of office &ndash; chaos on the railways, Aer Lingus in crisis, Luas way behind time&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;a botched flotation of Eircom and bedlam and traffic jams on the streets of our cities. There are few areas of the country that have experienced the profoundly detrimental effects of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke's term in office more than the north side of Dublin. Few areas have suffered as much from the incoherence and incompetence of the Minister on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>I will outline three glaring examples of the Minister's failure to deliver services and infrastructure to the north side of Dublin, with which I am sure many other Deputies will sympathise. In the first instance, the fiasco that has been the Minister's handling of the Luas project has been deeply felt on the north side of Dublin. In particular, I refer to the way in which she has effectively shelved the construction of the north side Luas line. The photo stunt last Sunday took the biscuit, but the way in which the north side Luas line has been handled beggars belief. The approach she has taken to this part of the Luas scheme has been epitomised by a failure to offer to the residents of the north side the same light rail facilities as will be available in other parts of the city. It seems the emphasis is solely on serving the needs of Dublin Airport and to hell with the needs of the residents of the north side of Dublin. However important it is to serve the airport, the people living in north Dublin are being forgotten as the Minister continues to filibuster about the north Dublin line. It seems at this point that we will not see the north side Luas line. Instead the emphasis is being placed on metro in order to provide a fast link from the city centre to the airport. That may be a desirable objective in itself, but it seems in the process that the needs of the people of the north side of Dublin, in terms of access to the city and jobs and services in other parts of the city, have been completely forgotten. It seems that the north side Luas line is indefinitely shelved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another deficiency of the Minister is her incompetent management of and policy for Dublin Bus. She has failed to recognise the principle <Col N="378" /> that if bus services in Dublin are to be enhanced, adequate subvention and support must be forthcoming. She has failed to adopt the approach taken in other European cities, most of which have bus services that have subvention rates in excess of 50%. In Athens the subvention rate is almost 80% while in Dublin it is derisory. At a time when there is a crying need for enhanced public transport, the Minister continues to expect Dublin Bus to operate with one hand tied behind its back and continues to bad mouth the company in the process.</P>
    <P>While I could continue for much longer the last area I will mention is Aer Lingus. The Minister may well go down in history as having presided over the deconstruction of one of our most treasured State assets. Her complete and absolute disregard and disdain for the company and its employees has brought home clearly to many people the true colours of Fianna Fáil in relation to protecting State companies. The refusal of the Minister and the Taoiseach to adequately address the Aer Lingus crisis at European level speaks volumes about their attitude to the company and to the thousands of its employees facing redundancies. The Minister has thrown social partnership out the window in Aer Lingus and has refused to engage in constructive discussions with its unions and management.</P>
    <P>These are only three of a litany of failures and fiascos that have characterised the Minister's term of office. There is little time left for this Government, but it is not too late to put someone in charge of the Department of Public Enterprise who at least knows what he or she is doing, unlike the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for sharing her time with me. I speak specifically on behalf of the commuters in my constituency who spend so much of every day stuck in the congested traffic of this city. All those commuters would have been greatly saddened to hear the pathetic excuse of Government's response tonight to the plight they experience every day, to hear the Minister, who is directly responsible for public transport, substitute her version of bluff and bombast for policy and product and to add insult to injury, to see the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, being sent to give his poor man's version of the &lsquo;town hall tonight' slapstick to distract attention from the Government's pathetic record on public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commuters whom I represent from Booterstown to Bray on average spend an hour travelling to work, if they work in the city centre, and an hour travelling home in the evening. Two hours a day five days a week is ten hours and that multiplied by 48 weeks of the year is 480 hours or 20 days. The average commuter in my constituency spends as much time stuck in traffic every year as he or she spends on annual leave. Worked out over the 40 years of a working life, that adds up to two and a half years or three and a half years of one's waking hours. That is a long sen<Col N="379" /> tence, a long time to be stuck frustrated in the traffic of this city.</P>
    <P>The release from that imprisonment is public transport. More than four years ago the then rainbow Government decided to proceed with the Luas project, a key component in the DTO strategy to give this city an efficient public transport system. The plan was to have Luas in place by 2002, but then there was a general election and the appointment of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, with responsibility for public transport. Her first decision was to reverse the rainbow Government's plan for the Luas system. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats had conceded to a section of the city centre business interests that Luas should be put under ground. The Minister commissioned a study by Atkins Consultants. To her discomfort, Atkins recommended that the Government should go ahead with the original rainbow Government plan to put Luas over ground but she binned the report and decided to put Luas under ground. All of that has resulted in a three year delay in the planning and delivery of Luas. It has probably put the city centre element of the project in serious doubt due to the geological uncertainty and the financial cost of the underground option. It has ripped the heart out of the DTO's strategy for an integrated public transport system in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, Dublin traffic has worsened, as the city has increased in size and most of its citizens have opted for the only available and reliable method of getting around at present, the private car. Public transport is spoken about, but it is ignored by the Government. In my constituency the DART has become overcrowded and often unreliable as the Minister has failed to provide the necessary additional carriages and trains.</P>

What the Minister and her Government lack in public transport delivery they make up in hard neck. Last Sunday the people who delayed work on Luas for the past four years paraded in front of a stationary Luas carriage on a make believe railway station as if they had come up with the idea themselves and they will take it all away for another three years. In another three years the Minister and her Government will be well out of office. Perhaps <Col N="380" /> then the frustrated Dublin commuter will be able to get a decent public transport system. Getting that in place has one precondition, getting the Minister and her Government off the tracks.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, had a cheek to give the statement he gave the House this evening. This is the Minister who cannot stand over what he has done in his Department in the past four and a half years. The dilapidated school buses are the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy O'Dea. They are death traps. Children are risking their lives every day when they travel on them to and from school. What has the Minister of State done about it? Nothing. There has been a report on his desk gathering dust for the past two years. It addresses the issue but the Minister has done nothing.</P>
      <P>This is the same Minister about whom some of the youth organisations have complained to the Taoiseach. They complain of his lack of ability to tackle the issues in youth affairs for which he is supposed to be responsible. That is the Minister who came to the House to defend the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>Last week Irish Rail announced its decision to lay off 300 of its 600 freight staff. In the same week, the Minister for Public Enterprise claimed she intended to develop the rail infrastructure, open closed lines and expand the capacity of Irish Rail. The decision by Irish Rail is a direct contradiction of Government policy and the Minister's statement. Soundbites rather than action have been the backbone of the Government.</P>
      <P>Take the Luas as an example. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent on the Luas PR machine. The only thing that has happened with regard to Luas is the PR attached to it. No action has been taken to deal with the cattle trains that bring people to Dublin from the west every Sunday night and home to the west every Friday evening. As my colleague, Deputy Higgins, described them, they are like the trains in Calcutta. What has the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, done about it? Nothing, other than spend money on PR&mdash;</P>

There are 12,000 licensed haulage vehicles on the roads but Government policy has ignored this problem and turned its back on the 300 Irish Rail freight employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why after nearly four and a half years in office has the Minister for Public Enterprise only now decided to concentrate on the development of the rail network? The <Col N="381" /> upgrading of the rail line between Athlone and Westport only became a political priority after a near fatality in Knockcroghery, County Roscommon. Otherwise the Minister would not have made the investment despite clapping herself on the back earlier this evening for doing so. Policy has been reactive rather than proactive. We still have the most archaic rail safety legislation in the EU. The rail safety inspector in the Department is such in name only, with no powers to compel Irish Rail to furnish relevant information.</P>
      <P>The shambles in the rail sector is similar to the situation in the electricity sector. Each winter since the Government took office, the power crisis has progressively got worse, yet the private sector has its hands tied in meeting the deficit due to the Minister's inability or lack of will to tackle the red tape of regulation. This is further compounded by the lack of capacity in the ESB to connect power to new homes throughout the country. Many young couples are tonight waiting six months for the ESB to connect power to their homes. It is as bad as getting telephones connected in the early 1980s. We will have to bring back Mark Killilea. He seems to be the only person who can address the problem. This problem also exists in Deputy Brennan's constituency.</P>

      <P>Look at the housing schemes that were due to be developed by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.

      <P>Eircom was supposed to provide broadband investment across the country. However, it has not provided fibre optic cable because it claims it is uneconomical. What has the Minister done? She has turned her back on the west. She does not give a damn because the fibre optic cable is now in Athlone so the rest of us can take a run and jump. Take the example of ADSL. The Minister spoke about high speed information technology and high speed Internet access. She talked and talked but implemented nothing. The funding has not been provided and she has not provided legislation to tackle these issues. All she has done is promote these matters through her PR, spin doctors and statements. There has been no action whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. I was amazed the Minister came to the House with a long speech but spent most of her time attacking the Opposition. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, had 15 minutes to make his contribution. He spent two minutes defending the Minister and the rest of his speech was an attack on the Opposition. He referred back to the time of Brian Boru, as another Member pointed out. I was worried when it started but I am more worried now. Surely the Government Deputies had something positive to say about the Minister rather than simply attack the Opposition. Things must be worse than we thought.</P>
      <P>I travel a good deal on trains. There were huge queues last weekend for the mainline train to Cork from Dublin. I have listened to my colleagues talk about the trains to the west, but the Cork to Dublin line is the flagship service. People want to travel by public transport but the Minister could not tell me last week when the extra carriages will be delivered. They are not even ordered yet after four and a half years in office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan referred earlier to the rail line to Midleton. This has been mooted for the past five years as a means of opening up east Cork. Everybody thought the project was a success. The local authorities have come on board and the strategic planning is in place. What did the Minister and Iarnród Éireann do? They ordered yet another feasibility study which has not yet started and will probably take another 12 months to be completed. In the meantime, nothing will happen with this line. I hope by then the Minister and Fianna Fáil will no longer be in office.</P>
      <P>We are still waiting for the sustainable energy Bill. It is due to come before the Dáil but the Government has not prioritised it. The Minister of State must take responsibility for that. It must be prioritised and I call on the Minister to bring it forward. It is extremely important.</P>
      <P>Eircom has been mentioned. Everybody watched the debacle when Eircom shares were touted and flouted around the country. Many people lost a lot of money on those shares. Compare that to the smoke and mirrors situation we saw this week with the Luas launch. That exhibition cost £25,000.</P>

The Taoiseach is now reported in the newspapers to be saying that Aer Lingus might not survive beyond the weekend. That is appalling.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister and the Taoiseach not to allow Aer Lingus to go to the wall. If it does go to the wall, there will be a serious impact on this country. Tourism has been mentioned. If Aer Lingus is lost, tourism will suffer. Tourism is already in serious trouble. We need a proactive infrastructure. People from America have told me that to get to the west of Ireland is a nightmare, regardless of whether one travels by train or car.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed miserably on all fronts. It gives me no great pleasure to tell the House that it is time for the Minister to go. I ask her to resign honourably so that we can see if somebody else in Fianna Fáil can do a better job, although there probably is nobody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment. One year ago County Cavan received excellent news when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced that the American company, Teradyne Incorporated, was to invest £50 <Col N="384" /> million in a major new industrial campus near Cavan town. The development was to create 740 jobs over a five year period. It was a great achievement to bring Teradyne, a major interconnect systems manufacturer, to Cavan. The announcement represented the first significant IDA supported investment in County Cavan in over 22 years. I compliment Teradyne on its decision to locate in Cavan.</P>
      <P>When the Government took office in June 1997 I enlisted the support of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to try to bring inward investment to County Cavan. I appreciate the efforts and wholehearted commitment to the creation of jobs in Cavan. Last Friday evening we heard the extremely disappointing news of Teradyne's deferral of the construction of a major new industrial campus. Everyone in County Cavan and adjoining areas is disappointed by the deferral. I know the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment are similarly disappointed, as they put a huge effort into securing the investment. There was a wholehearted joint co-operative effort by the executive of the local authority, local public representatives, the IDA regional manager and his staff and the county enterprise board to bring the project to County Cavan.</P>
      <P>Teradyne has set up in a temporary base in the IDA advance factory near Cavan, where 44 people are employed. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to help consolidate the 44 jobs. I hope the upturn in the economy in the next 12 months will mean that Teradyne can increase and expand its workforce considerably. My special appeal to the Government is to make every effort possible and give encouragement to Teradyne to retain and increase its present workforce in Cavan. I acknowledge Teradyne's statement last week that it has received the wholehearted co-operation of the statutory agencies in County Cavan and the support of the public at large. Teradyne knows it has come to a county with a good workforce, with committed and diligent people. I appeal to the Minister of State to do everything to help us get over this disappointing news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past Deputy Brendan Smith and I have disagreed, or agreed to disagree, on many issues and we will do so again in the future. We are in agreement on this issue, however. Last week's announcement caused devastation not only in Cavan town, but in the county and the hinterland. It was preceded by 24 hours by the announcement that full planning permission for the Teradyne plant had been granted, after an appeal to An Bórd Pleanála. Friday's announcement was more than people expected and they were greatly surprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teradyne's announcement of its intention to locate in Cavan was welcomed by the community. Its representatives were welcomed with open arms during their many visits to Cavan, when <Col N="385" /> many positive statements of the corporation's commitment to Cavan were made. We are happy that an advance factory has been set up outside Cavan town, where 44 people are employed, as Deputy Brendan Smith rightly said. We hope the jobs will be held in the hope there will be an expansion when the economy improves. I do not blame the Government for the downturn in the global economy, as it is not to blame. I do not blame the Government for the fact that Teradyne decided to pull out.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Taoiseach to take immediate action to redress this great disappointment. Teradyne's decision has had a devastating effect. Young couples involved in the information technology industry in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick had made plans to return to live in Cavan. They had speculated in the purchase of a house or site which could be developed. Investors had purchased sites as they thought housing would be in demand. All these plans have collapsed after last Friday. I ask the Minister of State and the Government to take personal action. The 94 acres that have been developed on the Cavan bypass form an ideally located campus, one of the finest sites in the country. The IDA should purchase the site to prepare it for the economic upturn, which surely will come.</P>
    <P>Another measure that is needed is the decentralisation of State offices from Dublin to Cavan to soften the blow of last week's decision. The Minister of State cannot disagree with my statement that it is impossible to get in and out of Dublin. I do not believe decentralisation should replace the Teradyne development, but it would show that the Government is interested in taking action to help us cope with this major disappointment. Such a gesture would bring a response from the people of Cavan, who do not depend on others to help them and who have shown they can help themselves with indigenous industry, which has been thriving. Cavan has not benefited from the economic arm of the peace process. It has not received a red penny. Cross-Border bodies were denied to Cavan and an agricultural body, ideally suited to Cavan, was placed in Cork. There is a case to be made for decentralisation to Cavan, which has waited 24 years for inward investment. As many of the suppliers to Monaghan Poultry Products, which recently closed, were Cavan farmers, there has been a double body blow. I appeal to the Minister of State not to ignore Cavan and to ensure Cavan will benefit in the short-term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Brendan Smith and Boylan for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I was also disappointed to learn of Teradyne's decision not to go ahead with its Cavan investment plan. I appreciate the huge disappointment of the people of the area. Having visited the area many <Col N="386" /> times and as someone who knows it well, I know that Cavan people are resilient.</P>
      <P>Teradyne is the world's largest manufacturer of automatic test equipment and a leading producer of advanced interconnect systems, the spinal columns of electronic systems. In 1990 Teradyne (Ireland) Limited was established in Blanchardstown to manufacture interconnection systems, creating 160 jobs. Some 230 people are currently employed there. In July 2000 the Government approved a proposal by Teradyne to expand its existing Blanchardstown manufacturing facility, creating 90 jobs, and create a further 740 manufacturing jobs over a period of five years in a campus development in Cavan. I deeply regret Teradyne's decision not to proceed with its Cavan investment plan. Teradyne has suffered under the current market downturn, as Deputies have acknowledged. The downturn has been further exacerbated by the events of 11 September. Sales for the quarter ending 30 September 2001 fell over 70% from the same quarter last year to $249.2 million, with a net loss of $169.9 million, making the Cavan expansion plan no longer a viable option.</P>
      <P>The initial commitment of Teradyne to invest in Cavan clearly endorses it as a suitable location for international investment. Teradyne's decision to reassess its position relates to the downturn in the world economic situation and is unrelated to the environment in Cavan, which is very positive. IDA Ireland last year opened a regional office in Cavan town, which is its headquarters for all regional development in the Border region. IDA Ireland will continue to promote Cavan vigorously and work across all agencies to co-ordinate the delivery of the infrastructural and education investment under the national development plan. This will be essential to Cavan's future as a centre for future foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>Over the last two years IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies, with the aim of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into areas with Objective One status, such as Cavan. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions. Other initiatives include putting a greater focus on marketing regions for specific sectors and improving marketing material for the regions. IDA Ireland's incentive package is strongly geared in favour of Objective One regions, in line with new EU state aid limits. As a result of the above initiatives, 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during 2000 in new greenfield investment projects have been secured for Objective One regions. This is a strong result, which came from intensive and radically changed marketing approaches by the IDA team, working in close partnership with the local authorities and third level colleges and universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the ongoing retrenchment in the US economy, the source of a significant proportion of overseas investment, the IDA continues to strive towards maintaining this level of investment in the BMW region. However, improved access is <Col N="387" /> crucial to attracting new overseas investment to the regions and, in this context, the importance of improved air and road access cannot be over-emphasised. This has been recognised in the national development plan which includes plans to bring our roads, railways and air services up to a standard consistent with a modern economy within the next six years. Availability of high quality telecommunications and energy supplies is also essential. IDA Ireland will be keeping in close contact with relevant infrastructure providers to ensure that they are aware of IDA Ireland's priorities. I assure the Deputies that the development agencies will continue to promote Cavan for additional investment and job creation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank your office, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me this opportunity to raise the important issue of inadequate policing in the Tallaght region. I am glad the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in the House to respond to this serious issue in my part of Dublin.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the decision was made to accord divisional status to Tallaght. Ridiculous as it may seem, until that point Tallaght was a sub-division of Crumlin for policing purposes. The Minister's last reply stated that Tallaght has a population of 101,000. The purpose of affording divisional status to the Tallaght region at the time of the rainbow Government was to enable greater resources to be put at the disposal of the local gardaí in terms of the policing demands of the region. Normally with divisional status comes extra manpower, vehicles and resources to reflect the divisional status of that region.</P>
      <P>There are 101,000 people in a complex area in terms of policing demands, yet the Minister's last reply to me stated that there are 157 gardaí in the area. Can one imagine the demands of three shift working five over seven days with 157 gardaí? The last time I raised this issue with the Minister we got five extra gardaí, which I thank him for and welcome. Every time I raise this issue we get extra gardaí, yet there are still only 157 gardaí there. Limerick, for example, has a smaller population yet, according to the Minister's last reply to me, it has 446 gardaí. How can that be justified? How can 157 people be expected in the conditions of modern society to police a region of more than 100,000 people on three shift working five over seven with the demands of turning up in court, etc.? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious problem in my area of Dublin. I say with a heavy heart that young people are losing confidence in and respect for the gardaí. That is due in no small part to the fact that law abiding citizens cannot get a garda when they need one. I do not mean this in a disrespectful way to the Minister, but this is not rural Ireland. Rural Ireland has many positive things going for it, but it does not have the policing complexity of a region like west Dublin or my own in <Col N="388" /> Tallaght. There are serious demands and if they are not met, others will come forward to fill the vacuum. That has happened in Tallaght in recent years. Others came forward in areas which were not policed or policed inadequately &ndash; speeding through an estate in a squad car is not an answer to policing &ndash; and made a name for themselves while posing as the defenders of the people when law abiding citizens could not get gardaí to respond to their distress.</P>
    <P>I am sad that we have not made any great strides on the question of community policing. I would like to see more gardaí devoted to policing these communities on foot and meeting and getting to know the people there. That cannot be done when the first people to be sent to the Border or to man foot and mouth exigencies are the community police.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to explain what has happened the building that was supposed to be built or extended to accommodate the new divisional status. There is still no sign of that building starting after four and a half years. I have suggested to the Minister privately that the piece of ground there has great development capacity in line with the architecture of the Tallaght town square and, at the same time, it would provide modern comfortable facilities for an adequate police force in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to explain the latest position with regard to Tallaght Garda station.</P>
      <P>The current position is that plans to provide substantial additional accommodation at Tallaght station are at an advanced stage. A revised sketch scheme for the work has been received from the Office of Public Works and is being examined by the Garda authorities from the point of view of meeting their needs. While I appreciate the Deputy's concern in relation to Tallaght station and the fact that it has taken some time to advance the building project, and I share that concern, it must be borne in mind that the resources available to cover Garda accommodation are limited and that priorities have to be set in progressing Garda building projects.</P>
      <P>In the general context of providing proper facilities for all gardaí to serve the public, the Government has significantly increased the allocation for capital works from £7 million in 1997 to £19.5 million in 2000. Since 1998 in excess of £51 million has been allocated in the Office of Public Works Vote for capital works on Garda properties. In anyone's language, that is a substantial sum of money. Similarly, since 1998 a sum of just under £21 million has been secured in the Garda Vote for the necessary maintenance works to Garda stations and I increased this allocation from £3.37 million in 1997 to £7.1 million for 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gardaí occupy 703 Garda stations and other units of accommodation around the coun<Col N="389" /> try, including married quarters, large complexes like Templemore and Garda headquarters and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied by them were built before the foundation of the State and were designed for a different era. This extensive resource, while invaluable in guaranteeing the provision of police services to the community, creates its own unique maintenance and refurbishment demands. Consequently, all Garda accommodation is continually under review to ensure it meets the operational requirements of the force. Where it does not, then the necessary works are prioritised and completed with the appropriate degree of urgency.</P>
    <P>I confirm to Deputy Rabbitte that I am anxious to expedite the transfer of Garda divisional functions to Tallaght as quickly as possible. In that regard my Department, in conjunction with the other parties involved, particularly the Garda authorities and the Office of Public Works, is making every effort to ensure that the necessary new works will be carried out with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is here this evening to reply to this issue. There is widespread and genuine concern among the public and gardaí in Tralee following a number of assaults on Garda personnel in recent weeks. As a result, six gardaí are on long-term sick leave. Last Wednesday night, Hallowe'en night, a female garda received hospital treatment after being set upon and a male colleague was bitten and had to receive seven stitches. This is not acceptable and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.</P>
      <P>Tralee is a growing urban centre with a population of more than 20,000 people. This is swelled by more than 3,000 students who attend the local institute of technology for eight months of the year. Tralee has also become a popular destination for weekenders who come to Tralee for the night life and its reputation as a fun town. Tourist numbers visiting Tralee have grown considerably since the early 1990s. Almost one million tourists now visit Tralee during the year. Despite the economic boom, Tralee is still a blackspot as regards employment opportunities. All these factors and more contribute to making the town a more difficult place to police than previously and demands greater investment in terms of manpower and other resources than is currently the case.</P>
      <P>There are 70 gardaí attached to Tralee Garda station. They are assigned to various duties. Eight members are in the traffic corps which covers the entire county and, as the population of County Kerry doubles for most of the tourist season, they are kept very busy and cannot be reassigned to other duties. There are ten gardaí in the detective branch investigating serious crime and three are in the drugs squad. There are two collators, a number of crime prevention officers and district clerks and two gardaí are confined to the PULSE programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> That leaves six gardaí to police Tralee at night when young people are on the streets and there is a greater threat of public disorder. Most of the time there are only two gardaí on the beat in the town with two on patrol in a squad car while the remaining two are engaged in community policing duties in the large housing estates. The squad car is regularly deployed to places such as Dingle, Ardfert, Fenit, Abbeydorney and Castlegregory in the Minister's constituency after 2 a.m. Most people are spilling out onto the streets from pubs and it is at this time that there is the greatest need for a Garda presence in Tralee. The gardaí on duty could be called out to far away towns and there are no back-up services or resources available for the unfortunate, isolated gardaí who are left behind to police the town when a large number of revellers are on the streets. Usually people become boisterous and public disorder results. It is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The chief superintendent in Tralee recently stated in <i>The Irish Examiner</i>:</P>
    <P>I would be very disturbed that our members should be subjected to attack, particularly injury. But because of the type of work we do, it can occur on occasions and while we try to minimise such problems, we can't always anticipate them.</P>
    <P>The people of Tralee and the gardaí who work there are disturbed. It is up to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, as the local representative and the man who made so much of the concept of zero tolerance, to put policing arrangements in place in Tralee and provide proper and adequate resources so that the Garda authorities can ensure there are foot patrols on the street and gardaí are not vulnerable to attack, which is totally unacceptable. Gardaí are also receiving intimidatory telephone calls at their homes and are put under other pressures by criminals on the streets of Tralee. I appeal to the Minister to act.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to set out for the benefit of the House the resources being made available to the Garda in Tralee. The Deputy asked if I would provide the necessary resources to support the Garda in Tralee. As the Deputy will appreciate I am responsible, as Minister, for the overall provision of resources to the Garda Síochána, while the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas.</P>
      <P>When the Government took office we gave a simple commitment in regard to Garda strength. We said we would increase the strength of the force to 12,000 and we have delivered on that commitment. By the end of next year, the strength of the Garda will stand at 12,000, the highest ever in the history of the State. The result will be an increase of 1,200 gardaí since I took office. I am proud we have fulfilled this commitment and kept our promise to the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> As regards the deployment of those gardaí, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the level of Garda manpower assigned to various areas, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. As well as increasing the strength of the force, I have also provided additional financial resources. The provision in the Garda Vote when I took office was £457 million while the provision for this year is more than £690 million. This is a significant increase by any standards.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda and ensuring that the number of Garda personnel is increased. Furthermore, never in the history of the State has there been such a major prison building programme to ensure those convicted of crime serve their sentences. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength &ndash; all ranks &ndash; at Tralee Garda station is 86. This compares with a strength of 76 in 1997. As the Deputy can see, there has been an increase of ten in the number of gardaí assigned to the station.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the Garda Commissioner regarding policing in Tralee and he has indicated that, following local discussions, extra gardaí will be deployed on the streets in the town at critical periods as and when required. In that context, the Deputy will be interested that the number of gardaí assigned to the Kerry division has increased since 1997 from 233 to 251.</P>
    <P>As regards policing arrangements, I am informed that the town and its 58 housing estates are regularly patrolled by gardaí on foot, motorcycle or in patrol cars. In addition, there are three community policing schemes which cover most of the housing estates, with one garda attached full time to each scheme and 31 neighbourhood watch and five community alert schemes, all of which have a liaison garda.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that intervening with young people at risk of falling into anti-social and criminal lifestyles is a very necessary and worthwhile investment. I have made £180,000 available to date for the CONNECT 7 youth diversion project in Tralee. I have no doubt this project is paying dividends in diverting young people away from trouble. As the Deputy can see, the Garda in Tralee is involved with the community across a range of initiatives. All this brings gardaí into regular and ongoing contact with the people they serve and reinforces and enhances the already excellent relationship between the gardaí and the community.</P>
    <P>While the number of indictable crimes reported for County Kerry in 1996 was 1,536, by 1999 this figure had fallen to 1,357, a decrease of 179 offences or 6%. The detection rate in County <Col N="392" /> Kerry is 48%, making it significantly higher than the national average of 42% and one of the highest in the country.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to comment on reported remarks made, in the context of crime in Tralee, about female gardaí not being able to cope with certain cases. Let me say loud and clear that female gardaí play a vital role across the full range of policing tasks. I am in no doubt that we have a more effective, attuned and responsive police service since women began to join the Garda in large numbers. I would be concerned &ndash; I am sure the Deputy will join me in this &ndash; if the message was to go out that female gardaí are not, as one newspaper headline quoted, &ldquo;up to the job&rdquo;. This is certainly not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue on behalf of the people of Cobh. Cobh is one of the largest towns in County Cork, with a population of more than 12,000, which is rapidly increasing. The town does not have a community centre, cinema, theatre, concert hall, swimming pool or playground. It has few facilities for young or old, it has no facilities for the handicapped and it has little industry. The people of Cobh, nonetheless, recognise the infrastructure deficit and have set out to build a community centre. Over recent years they have raised more than £300,000. A prime development site was donated to them by Cobh parish and they have obtained planning permission. It has also linked up with the COPE Foundation which is prepared to fit out and run workshops and recreational facilities for local <Col N="393" /> handicapped people in order to avoid the necessity of their having to travel to Cork city each day.</P>
      <P>A number of social problems exist in Cobh because of the lack of facilities there. Increasing numbers of young people are engaging in under-age drinking and being coerced into taking drugs. There is a high level of unemployment and Irish Ispat closed recently. People have become despondent on foot of what they perceive as a lack of interest in the town, which is not an island but which is cut off. Five applications have been made in recent years to various Departments seeking funding to assist their plans for development. To date, nothing has been received. At this stage, those who have worked very hard &ndash; to raise £300,000 in a town such as Cobh is not easy &ndash; have reached the conclusion that it may be a waste of time to apply for lottery funding. What can they do now? I hope the Minister will offer the people of Cobh a glimmer of hope this evening.</P>
      <P>Should these people continue with their work and what should they do with the money they have raised? Is the fact that the application does not contain adequate reference to sport &ndash; even though attempts have been made to skew it in that direction &ndash; a problem? Will funds be provided for such community projects in the future? I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will agree that if there is no community centre &ndash; a place for young and old people to come together &ndash; social problems will arise which will have to be dealt with by the Garda and others.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to use his influence in Cabinet to ensure that matching funds are released at the earliest opportunity to the people of Cobh who have come more than halfway at this stage and who are seeking assistance from the State in order to allow work on the community centre to proceed. If the Minister could indicate that before the year is out some Government funding will be made available, the people of Cobh &ndash; whose cause I was asked to fight &ndash; and I would be delighted.</P>
      <P>I look forward to what the Minister has to say and I hope he will have good news for the people of Cobh. I hope he has researched this matter properly and has something positive to say because the people of the town are in need of a lift.</P>

      <P>I wish to extend the apologies of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation for his inability to be present to take this debate. I thank the Deputy for raising this issue in relation to Cobh which must be one of the most beautiful towns in Ireland, if not Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme operated by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation provides funding towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities and is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of such facilities in Ireland. The <Col N="394" /> Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has allocated £106 million to 2,044 projects under the programme during the term of this Government.</P>
    <P>The sports capital programme is advertised on an annual basis. All the applications received are assessed in accordance with detailed assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme. The criteria include the extent to which the project will increase the levels of active participation in sport-recreational sport and-or result in improved standards of sporting performance; the extent to which the project will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the financial viability of the project, that is, has the club-organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area and the current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies. The applications are scored in relation to the full list of criteria and in comparison with the other applications from their county.</P>
    <P>These criteria have been in operation since the 1999 programme. Cobh community centre has submitted applications to the programme in each of the last three years. In 1999 and 2000, the organisation requested a somewhat unrealistic amount of funding in relation to the amount available, of the order of £1 million, particularly given the low level of sporting element in the project and the lack of its own funding, for example, in 2000 it only had 6% of the project cost when the criteria specify that a minimum of 30% must be in place. On both occasions, the organisation was informed of its assessment score and given indications of the criteria in which it had not scored well.</P>
    <P>In excess of 1,450 applications were received under the 2001 sports capital programme, 164 of which were from County Cork &ndash; including one from the Cobh community centre committee. Following this year's assessment process, the application from the organisation was unsuccessful. Once again its overall score in comparison with the other applications received from County Cork was not sufficiently high under all the criteria and the fact that it contained very little reference to sport was also a factor. The Department conveyed the decision to the committee in a letter dated 13 June 2001, together with a copy of the assessment conducted on the application including the score and explanatory comments under each of the criteria.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, intends to advertise the 2002 sports capital programme shortly and I understand that Cobh community centre has requested that an application form be forwarded to it. The organisation is once again advised to closely study the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme and the shortcomings of previous applications and to consider the project in this light. Should an application be received from the centre it will be given every consideration under the criteria and conditions of the programme.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the swimming pool programme is also administered by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation's Department. In relation to a pool for Cobh, the situation is that in July 1996 the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which operated the programme at the time, approved proposals by Cobh Urban District Council for a new swimming pool in the town. The UDC subsequently submitted contract documents, that is, detailed plans and specifications, to that Department in October 1997.</P>
    <P>The documentation was examined by the Department's technical advisers and found generally to be in order. However, during the discussions between the technical advisers and the <Col N="396" /> consultants for the project, the issue of management of the facility post-construction was raised and arising from these discussions the council has now made substantial changes to the original design and has submitted the documentation for revised part X planning. The council has been notified that further documentation is necessary before the programme's technical advisers &ndash; the Office of Public Works &ndash; can assess this proposal.</P>
    <P>The proposed site for Cobh swimming pool is adjacent to most of the schools in the town. The work will involve demolition of the existing facility, modification of the existing swimming pool tank and construction of a separate learner pool. Other ancillary accommodation includes a centralised changing village and administration areas. A segregated leisure centre is also included and comprises separate changing facilities, a gymnasium and aerobics room and a leisure suite including treatment rooms, steam room and sauna. Site works include access roads, staff and public car parking, hard and soft landscaping, boundary walls, external lighting and mechanical and electrical services infrastructure. This facility would be used to the maximum extent by schoolchildren during the day and the wider community in the evening and at weekends.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 November 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 102 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, confers a right to retain, as a tenant, possession of a formerly rent controlled dwelling for the lifetime of the person who was the tenant at the commencement of the Act on 26 July 1982 and for the lifetime of their spouse. Where a member or successive members of the tenant's family succeeded to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to retain possession under the 1982 Act continues to 25 July 2002 with a secured minimum tenancy period of five years even where this may extend beyond that date. Once protection ceases under the 1982 Act, successor tenants may apply to the courts for a renewable lease of up to 35 years under the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> In an effort to establish the number of tenants remaining in the sector and their status local authorities, at the request of my Department, carried out a survey of landlords in March 1999. As the results from this survey were unsatisfactory, local authorities were requested in October 2000 to carry out a further survey directed this time to the tenants. This was supplemented by notices in the national media which alerted tenants to the fact that the survey was being undertaken and asked them to contact their local authority if the authority did not include them in the survey.</P>
    <P>A total of 8,489 properties, identified from local authorities' registers of formerly rent controlled dwellings, were surveyed and 5,360 replies were received. Based on the survey results, it is estimated that some 1,700 properties currently remain within the sector, the majority of which are occupied by original tenants and-or their spouses whose right to remain in the dwelling will not be affected. It is estimated that the tenure rights of less than 600 successor tenants nationally will be affected by the changes to come into effect in July 2002.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, in particular, at the extent to which rent levels payable by successor tenants might increase in the post July 2002 situation. In consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, my Department is considering what action may be appropriate to support the situation of low income successor tenants and I intend that this matter should be resolved before the end of the year. Landlords and tenants affected will be advised of their rights in good time before the changes are due to take effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 486 and 507 together.</P>
      <P>The special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is administered by a task force under the aegis of my Department, provides assistance to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary conditions. In addition, health boards were advised in February 2000 that the scheme was extended to include the provision of heating systems, where necessary.</P>
      <P>The allocations to the boards are determined by the task force and are based on the statistical returns received twice yearly from the health boards, showing the level of activity within the area, the actual number of applications in hand and the estimated cost of these applications. I am satisfied that this is a fair and equitable means of allocating the available funding. It is a matter for the boards to apportion funding to each community care area, and to determine, within their allocation, the priority of individual cases in hand.</P>
      <P>The scheme itself is extremely effective, with 2,288 jobs completed in the period January to June 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, an increase of 33% on the same period last year and 2,360 jobs are under way. An increase of 24% in applications has also been recorded.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the valuable work being done, funding for the scheme has been increased significantly in recent years from £4 million in 1997, £5 million in 1998, £6 million in 1999 to £8 million last year and £8.65 million in 2001. The provision for the scheme in 2001 has been fully allocated and no additional funding is available in the current year. As the overall amount available for the scheme in any year is limited, it is not possible to dispense with the system of making separate allocations to the health boards. However, because the scheme is funded by the national lottery it has not been possible to allocate additional funding to the scheme from elsewhere in my Department's Vote where such funding might be available. This is an issue which I propose to resolve with effect from the coming financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The average waiting times for driving tests at each testing centre, as at 2 November 2001, are set out in the following table. The average waiting time for a test nationally is 14 weeks compared to 21 weeks this time last year. The target of ten weeks average waiting has been met at six of our test centres with an average waiting time of 15 weeks or less being achieved at 32 out of 49 test centres nationally.</P>
      <P>An additional 11 driver testers are in training and will be assigned to centres with the longest waiting times shortly. I anticipate that we will be at or close to our ten week target waiting time by the end of this year. The numbers on the waiting list have continued to reduce and are now 59,300 compared to 79,400 a year ago. This has been achieved despite a further 10% increase in applications in 2001 compared to the record 167,300 applications received in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the driver testing service was carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Government decided on 18 July 2001 to accept the recommendation of the PWC report that a public sector agency be established to deliver the driver testing service. Preliminary work has <Col N="401" /> already commenced in my Department to progress implementation of this Government decision.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases in which the European Commission has initiated legal action or announced that it intends to take legal action, arising from the failure by the Government to implement European Union directives for which his Department has responsibility; the steps he is taking to ensure that all of these directives are implemented in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently four cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action. The first concerns the making of waste management plans. While the formal judgment of the European Court is expected shortly, the Commission now acknowledges that Ireland has met its obligations in this regard.</P>
      <P>The second case concerns water quality in certain private rural water supplies. My Department is actively pursuing an intensive programme of measures to improve these supplies and achieve high water quality.</P>
      <P>The third case concerns non-compliance with the directive on polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls, PCB-PCT. The EPA's national hazardous waste management plan largely addresses the requirements of the directive. Further work by the EPA to identify all PCB holdings will address outstanding requirements.</P>
      <P>The fourth case, recently notified, concerns the designation of vulnerable zones under the nitrates directive. Ireland gave effect to the nitrates directive through dissemination, in 1996, of a code of good agricultural practice and appropriate monitoring of water quality since 1992. All available water quality data are being assessed with a view to designating nitrate vulnerable zones by end 2001.</P>
      <P>The Commission has announced its intention to take legal action, but no formal notice has issued, in one other case, in relation to the dangerous substances directive. For the purposes of this directive water quality standards have been established for phosphorous and 14 other substances. However, EPA monitoring indicates that dangerous substances, other than phosphorous, are not a problem in Irish waters generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission has also initiated legal action regarding late transposition of the Seveso II directive. Primary responsibility rests with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who substantially transposed the directive through regulations made in December 2000. Certain planning requirements arising under the directive were brought into force on 1 January 2001 by the planning and development Act, 2000. The outstanding planning requirements are contained in the detailed planning regulations currently before the Joint Oireachtas <Col N="403" /> Committee on the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the rural water programme grants of up to £1,600, 2,032, per house are available from local authorities for the provision of private sewage collection and disposal facilities by way of group sewerage scheme. I have no proposals at present to introduce a grant for the replacement of existing septic tanks by individual householders.</P>
      <P>The national rural water monitoring committee has reported to my Department with proposals for meeting the wastewater treatment and collection needs of small rural communities. The report recommends a pilot programme to test a range of new, small scale collection and treatment systems based on design, build, operate, DBO, procurement by local authorities. It also anticipates that the range of operations and services provided by DBO contractors would include the desludging of septic tanks and the treatment and disposal of sludges from all types of domestic wastewater treatment systems within the locality. I have approved the committee's recommendation and contract documents are currently being prepared for the pilot programme.</P>
      <P>Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the report envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside the immediate catchment of the new treatment systems. The confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes must await the results of the pilot programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 131 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national hazardous waste management plan was published by the EPA last July, relates <Col N="404" /> to the period 2001 to 2006, and will be implemented as rapidly as possible within that timeframe.</P>
    <P>Under section 26 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, relevant public authorities are required to have regard to the plan and, where they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to recommendations contained in the plan. As recommended in the plan, my Department will shortly establish an implementation committee which will be responsible for guiding its overall implementation.</P>
    <P>Other very significant elements of the plan will be addressed in the forthcoming policy statement on preventing and recycling waste. Improved collection and reception services for hazardous waste from household and commercial sources are already being put in place by local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to infrastructure, the plan identifies a requirement for landfill and thermal treatment capacity for hazardous waste requiring disposal, so as to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce our reliance on export outlets. A private company has announced proposals to develop a hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy, County Cork. As an exceptional measure, having regard to the polluter pays principle, it is intended that grant assistance will be available under the NDP to support the provision of landfill capacity for hazardous wastes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ensuring the quality of work carried out on streets, roads and footpaths by licensed contractors is primarily a matter for road authorities. Powers available under existing legislation, in particular section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, are already being used by urban road authorities to regulate the opening of roads by utilities. For example, Dublin Corporation is making extensive use of these powers through its directions for the control and management of roadworks in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>General guidance on the need for an efficient and expeditious approach to the carrying out of works, whether by road authorities or other statutory undertakers, is also set out in my Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A utilities and statutory bodies work group, chaired by the Dublin Transportation Office, was <Col N="405" /> established this year. The aim of the working group is to standardise the approach to roadworks through agreed codes of practice. The group is composed of representatives from various bodies and agencies currently involved in telecommunications network roll-out, including the Office of the Director of Communications, the DTO, the Departments of Public Enterprise and the Environment and Local Government, urban and rural local authorities, IBEC, Forfás, the National Roads Authority and Eircom. The director of traffic in Dublin Corporation is a member of the work group.</P>
    <P>A Communications (Regulation) Bill prepared by the Department of Public Enterprise, proposes,<i> inter alia</i>, to modernise legislation in relation to road openings by telecom operators. This Bill is currently being drafted by the office of the parliamentary counsel to the Government following approval of the general scheme of the Bill by the Government earlier this year.</P>
    <P>My Department is in communication with the Department of Public Enterprise with a view to ensuring that the regulatory framework which will apply to such operators will afford appropriate and updated powers to road authorities to regulate road openings by such operators in the public interest while recognising the benefits of further investment in telecommunications infrastructure. I am also considering a wider legislative updating to deal with this important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 93, 95 and 513 together.</P>
      <P>Certain fixed interest rate loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 carry rates in excess of current levels. These fixed interest rates reflect the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and are fixed for the life of the loan. The cost of reducing the fixed rates on these loans would be considerable and would have to be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Since 1980, borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This is a very significant concession. Borrowers with fixed rate mortgages from commercial lending agencies are obliged to pay significant redemption penalties of up to six months interest, or more, in the event of early redemption.</P>
      <P>On 25 February 2000 my Department undertook a survey of local authorities to determine the extent of remaining high fixed interest rate loans. The results of that survey showed that there were almost 44,000 individual fixed rate housing loans outstanding at that time, of which 38% were at 12.5% interest rates and the balance at rates under 12.5%. The average amount outstanding on an individual loan was less than £5,200, 6,602.63.</P>
      <P>In May of this year, it was established that the information supplied in response to the survey did not, in some cases, include tenant purchase loans. In view of this my Department requested all local authorities on 21 May 2001 to review, and update if necessary, the information supplied.</P>
      <P>Of the 42 local authorities issuing housing loans, 35 have responded to date to this second request. The number of additional cases included in the responses received to date is just over 19,000 which brings the overall total of fixed rate housing loans to some 63,000 and the average amount outstanding on individual loans to around £5,000, 6,348.69. My Department has consulted on a number of occasions with the remaining seven local authorities to establish the additional cases, if any, in these authorities and it is hoped to have their responses shortly.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of a reduction in the high fixed interest rates to the current local authority fixed rate of 5.3% would be in the region of £11 million in the first year declining thereafter as loans are paid off. My Department is examining the possible options in relation to these loans.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 104, 112 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and action on housing in relation to the provision of local authority housing is to achieve a total of 25,000 house starts in a four year multi-annual programme 2000 to 2003. Satisfactory progress will have been achieved by end 2001 with 5,000 starts last year and an expected 7,000 starts in the current year.</P>
      <P>The total number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities in 2000 was 3,207 units and the expected output this year should be around the 5,000 mark. This increased level of output is underpinned by an increased level of work in progress which will sustain a similar level of output in 2002. Voluntary housing output this year should be the highest level ever recorded at about 1,200 units compared to 951 last year and 579 in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the statutory assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at end March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households <Col N="408" /> in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts with local authorities my Department estimates that needs have increased by some 20% between March 1999 and March 2001. The next statutory assessment of housing needs is due to be undertaken by local authorities at end March 2002. This will be a comprehensive assessment of housing applications and will be undertaken in accordance with detailed guidelines to be issued by my Department by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Information available from the 1999 assessment of housing need indicates that more than two thirds of households assessed as in need of local authority housing were on the local authority waiting list for less than two years and it remains the case that a significant number of households on waiting lists are housed within two years. Some applicants for local authority housing, however, are on lists for longer periods on the basis that their priority for housing is relatively lower compared with the needs of households who have been allocated housing. Local authorities do not maintain waiting lists for houses being sold under the affordable housing scheme. Houses are advertised locally as they become available.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given to tackling this need. The local authority housing programme is, of course, only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists is being met. I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme together with the increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of around 11,000 households be met this year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households.</P>

      <P>The annual reports of the National Roads Authority detailing road accident statistics include details of casualties classified by road user type and age. The latest report, Road Accident Facts 2000, is available in the Oireachtas Library. It can be seen from this report that the highest number of casualties for the age groups recorded occurred in the 25-34 age group. The total num<Col N="409" /> ber of casualties in that age group was 2,676, which represents 21% of the overall total for the year.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to provide a firm estimate of future demand for provisional driving licences, but having regard to the demographic profile and trends in recent years it is anticipated that demand for first time provisional licences in the lower categories of licences will be of the order of 350,000 to 400,000 over the next five years. Since June 2001, all first time applicants for a provisional licence are required to have already passed the new driver theory test.</P>
      <P>Education and information are recognised in the Government road safety strategy 1998-2002 as being vital to forming good road safety habits in younger people who are the adult road users of the future. The National Safety Council was assigned the lead role by the Government strategy for road safety for the development of a resource pack on road safety for input into the social, personal, health and education programme in the new primary school curriculum. The resource pack called Be Safe was launched in September 2000 and over 30,000 copies of the pack have been distributed to primary school teachers, principals and boards of management.</P>
      <P>The NSC has also developed a secondary school transition year resource project on road safety. This resource was pilot tested in 20 secondary schools throughout the country and was launched on 10 September 2001. This resource will complement existing activities in secondary schools. The council also regularly targets young drivers in its public media campaigns.</P>
      <P>My Department was represented on a task group set up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in autumn 2000 at the request of the Minister for Education and Science to look at the whole area of driver education. The task group submitted its report to the Minister for Education and Science and I understand that he has authorised the NCCA to proceed with the research phase of a project on driver education recommended in the report.</P>

      <P>The latest official data on packaging waste arisings and recovery are contained in the national waste database report for 1998, published by the EPA in March 2000. The EPA estimates that 11,780 tonnes of aluminium packaging waste arose in the household and commercial waste streams in 1998. This includes aluminium beverage cans as well as other containers, such as aluminium trays for fast food, carton tops etc. <Col N="410" /> However, the proportion of aluminium cans within this waste stream is not given and my Department does not have information on the number of aluminium beverage cans placed annually on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>Based on data supplied by Repak Limited &ndash; the voluntary compliance scheme established by Irish industry to finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste &ndash; 719 tonnes of aluminium beverage containers were recovered for recycling in 1998. This tonnage represents 6% of all aluminium packaging waste but would represent a higher proportion of aluminium beverage cans placed on the market.</P>
      <P>Repak Limited has further indicated that it supported the collection and recovery of 800 tonnes of aluminium beverage containers last year &ndash; an increase of 81 tonnes over the 1998 figure.</P>

      <P>The national climate change strategy, which was published in November 2000 and is available in the Oireachtas Library, sets a ten-year framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto protocol. The strategy identifies a range of cross-sectoral and sector-specific measures to achieve the necessary reductions equitably and with economic and environmental efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> Implementation of the strategy is being co-ordinated by a cross-departmental climate change team which is chaired by my Department and has met on 12 occasions since January 2001. In addition to overseeing the successful implementation of the strategy, the team has established necessary consultative arrangements and will develop a robust and comprehensive set of indicators at a sectoral and national level, oversee the quantification of costs and benefits of implementing specific measures, and undertake the biennial review of the strategy, beginning in 2002, in consultation with Comhar.</P>
    <P>Work is under way on the development of a long-term communications strategy addressing awareness of climate change, and Comhar has prepared proposals for this; sub-groups on inventory data, emissions trading, negotiated agreements with industry, and economic analysis have also been established.</P>
    <P>Substantial measures identified in the strategy for their potential to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions limitation are under way at a sectoral level. They include a new renewable energy competition announced on 25 May 2001, and the granting of full market access to electricity from combined heat and power. Two new gas fired electricity generating plants will also be in place by 2002 using the most carbon efficient fuel which will be twice as efficient as existing plants. Substantial investment in public transport in the NDP will reduce reliance on the private car, especially in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Necessary changes to the building regulations to reduce energy requirements have been accelerated to ensure full implementation well ahead of the 2005 date in the strategy. On 27 September the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced the publication of consultation documents on the proposed amendment of Part L of the building regulations relating to conservation of fuel and energy. The radical upgrading of the thermal performance and insulation standards for new houses will have effect from 1 July 2002 and will result in a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide of more than 300,000 tonnes per annum by 2012.</P>
    <P>While emissions of greenhouse gases are currently over 20% above 1990 levels, and on a business as usual basis with continuing economic growth are projected to rise by up to 37% above 1990 levels by 2010, the national climate change strategy is specifically designed to make the necessary reductions to move away from these business as usual projections over the coming decade. Sectoral measures included in the strategy are intended to reduce emissions by over 15 million tonnes CO2 equivalent per annum. During the commitment period 2008 to 2012 this will ensure that our target is met effectively and on time.</P>

    <P>Official statistics in respect of 2000 will not be available until early next year. However, Repak Limited, the voluntary compliance scheme established by Irish industry to co-ordinate the collection and recovery of packaging waste, has reported that approximately 146,000 tonnes of <Col N="414" /> packaging waste were recycled under the Repak scheme in 2000. It is expected that over 25% of packaging waste &ndash; approximately 200,000 tonnes &ndash; will be recycled in 2001, in accordance with the targets set down in the packaging directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The number of road deaths in 2000 was 415. This is a 12% decrease on the 1997 level of 472. In 2000, 1,640 people were seriously injured on our roads which represents a 24.8% reduction on 1997 levels. Provisional returns for this year show that 332 people have been killed on the roads in the ten months ended 31 October compared with 347 for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly pursuing the implementation of its strategy for road safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Irish Government. The strategy has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Implementation of the strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report &ndash; July 1999 &ndash;  second progress report &ndash; August 2000 &ndash; and third progress report &ndash; July 2001 &ndash; detail progress with key actions. Copies of these reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The third progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. The level of roads deaths reduced by 12.1% between 1997 and 2000, and serious injuries decreased in the 1997-2000 period by almost 25% relative to a reduction target of 20% by end 2002. The interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been exceeded.</P>
    <P>Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 268 schemes completed by end 2000 and a further 88 approved. On the other hand, surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reducing speeding and increasing seat belt wearing. Drink driving, despite stricter enforcement, also remains a major problem.</P>
    <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. Over 224,000 on the spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 2000, compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. Fixed speed cameras are in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2000, approximately 84,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. The number of detections for drink driving in 2000 increased by 24% over 1998. Evidential breath testing was ahead of target by end of 2000 with 25 instruments in operation. It is intended to extend this to 40 by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy also provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was published in March 2001 and will be introduced in the Oireachtas shortly. My Department is also working to ensure the availability of a national driver file complete with penalty points functionality within the present year.</P>
    <P>Ensuring compliance with the targets of the road safety strategy commands the full effort and support of the Government and its agencies. By reference to the estimates set out in the strategy in 1998, over 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Act, 2001, allows for the introduction of a salary type payment of local authority members by way of regulations made with the consent of the Minister for Finance. In this context I received a joint submission from the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the General Council of County Councils and the Local Authority Members Association and last week met a joint deputation. The associations elaborated on their submission and a useful exchange of views took place as regards the proposal and related matters. The views of the associations, together with available funding and other relevant factors, will now form the backdrop to the design and implementation of the new system.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste provides that, not later than July 2003, member states must prepare a national strategy for the reduction of biodegradable waste going to landfills. Progressive targets are set in the directive so that bio-degradable municipal waste quantities consigned to landfill must be reduced to 35% of the total amount, by weight, of this waste produced in 1995 by 2016.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These targets were anticipated in the 1998 policy statement Changing our Ways, which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for a minimum national 65% reduction over fifteen years, in bio-degradable wastes consigned to landfill, and the development of composting and other feasible biological treat<Col N="417" /> ment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of bio-degradable waste per annum.</P>
    <P>These targets have also informed the development by local authorities of local and regional waste management plans, and pilot composting projects have already been put in place by a number of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am currently finalising a policy statement on preventing and recycling waste.

      <P>The most recent statistical information on Irish waste arisings is provided in the EPA's national waste database report for 1998, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>This report estimates that 1.22 million tonnes of household waste was generated in 1998, compared to an equivalent figure of 1.32 million tonnes in 1995, the first year in respect of which the national waste database was compiled. Earlier data are unreliable. Data on waste arisings per household are not available in NWD reports.</P>
      <P>In general, the EPA cautions that care must be taken in making comparisons between 1995 and 1998 waste data, as it can be difficult to determine the extent to which variations reflect real developments, or are a function of improved reporting and methodology.</P>
      <P>In this instance, while there is an apparent reduction in the quantity of household waste arising, the 1998 report suggests that the 1998 figure is simply a more accurate reflection of the actual quantities arising as the difference between reported quantities collected and estimated quantities arising is considerably less for 1998 than for 1995.</P>
      <P>The EPA's principal method of obtaining data on municipal waste, including household waste, for the 1998 report was through a questionnaire circulated to all local authorities, supported by information obtained from waste contractors and recycling organisations, and from waste composition surveys conducted by or on behalf of local authorities.</P>

      <P>Under planning legislation, each planning authority is obliged to prepare a development plan setting out an overall strategy for the planning and development of its area. Such plans would include the policy of the authority in relation to the provision of one off single houses. Decisions on individual applications are also a matter for each authority in accordance with its development plan or for An Bord Pleanála in the case of an appeal.</P>
      <P>As regards single houses in rural areas, it is essential that the farming community and those working on the land should be able to live in the country. However, a continuation of the current trends in one-off housing, particularly with regard to urban generated development, that is, development by those working in urban areas, will have significant implications in terms of a range of issues such as transport, the possibilities for strengthening many of our towns and villages, landscape and tourism and protection of ground and surface waters. All of these issues will be further considered in the context of the national spatial strategy now being finalised. The report Sustainable Development &ndash; A Strategy for Ireland, published in 1997, indicated that in general there should be a presumption against urban-generated, one-off rural housing adjacent to towns.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he is taking arising from the recent report of the Ombudsman which found that the administration of the planning system was in a state of collapse; if, in view of the Ombudsman's findings, he will consider the establishment of a planning inspectorate to enforce planning regulations and conditions and investigate complaints from the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the proposition that the planning system is in a state of collapse. Planning applications have increased significantly in recent years in line with the growth in the economy. Planning authorities have responded to this increase by improving their productivity substantially. However, the expansion in the demand for <Col N="419" /> planning permissions has in the short-term stretched the resources of planning authorities, and this has led to difficulties, in particular in relation to planning enforcement.</P>
      <P>I consider that strong and visible enforcement is critical to ensure that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. I, therefore, brought forward simplified and strengthened provisions on enforcement in the planning and development Act, 2000. These changes will address concerns identified by the Ombudsman, in particular the requirement on local authorities to keep complainants updated as enforcement actions proceed.</P>
      <P>The planning and development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August 2000. Because of the scale and complexity of the Act, and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. Draft regulations which will enable the development control provisions of the Act to be brought into force, have been prepared by my Department and sent on an informal basis to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. Oireachtas approval of the regulations is required and I hope to be in a position to make the regulations shortly.</P>
      <P>I have also been concerned to ensure adequate staffing levels of local authority planning departments through a variety of measures. My Department has approved numerous requests from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála for sanction for additional planning posts, both professional planners and administrative staff, although I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts. Nevertheless staffing levels are increasing.</P>
      <P>The most recent survey by my Department of the larger local authority planning departments, that is, county councils and county borough corporations, carried out in July 2001 found that the overall level of serving staff, both administrative and professional, had increased to 1210, which compared with a figure of 1090 in January 2001, 1066 in October 2000, 994 in July 2000 and 895 in September 1999. I have also liaised with the Minister for Education and Science and the third level education sector on ways of producing more planners through the education system. In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being pursued.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman's report acknowledged that these changes were being made, and stated his intention to monitor the area closely over the coming year. In light of this and because I believe enforcement is properly carried out at local level, I do not propose to establish a national planning inspectorate in relation to enforcement.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year Bord Gáis submitted a proposal for the installation of natural gas central heating in those local authority dwellings served by its existing and proposed distribution network at a cost of £3,500 per unit &ndash; July 2000 prices &ndash; the cost to be met by local authorities and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. Where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated housing estates, the installation of central heating may form part of the works undertaken. Local authorities may seek approval to the use of their internal capital receipts, which are surplus to the requirements of their local authority housing programme and remedial works scheme, for <Col N="421" /> improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing my Department has no capital allocation from which to fund the installation of central heating in local authority housing generally or to meet the costs which would arise from the implementation of the Bord Gáis proposals in this regard. However, it is open to individual local authorities to enter into negotiations with Bord Gáis or any other competent agency with regard to the installation of central heating in their rented dwellings. For example, I understand that Dublin Corporation hopes to install, from its own financial resources and in co-operation with Bord Gáis, gas fired central heating in 2000 of its dwellings which lack the facility.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the negative impact that heavy goods vehicles can have particularly in urban areas. For example, the road accidents facts 2000 report, which has been prepared and published by the National Roads Authority, shows that 74 of the 415 road accident fatalities involved goods vehicles. A copy of that report is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Some 90% of freight in Ireland is carried by road. A balanced approach must be adopted, therefore, that takes into account environmental, health and safety issues while at the same time facilitating the movement of goods. Measures are included in the national development plan which will, on completion, significantly improve the traffic situation in both urban and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NDP includes an amount of £4.7 billion for the improvement and maintenance of the national road network in the period 2000 to 2006. This is a threefold increase in the level of investment in national roads provided for in 1994-99. This funding will ensure: development by 2006 of the major inter-urban routes to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard; further major improvements on other national primary routes, and an improvement of national secondary roads, with emphasis on routes which are of particular importance to economic and regional development, including links to the strategic corridors, <Col N="422" /> roads serving key ports, airports, tourists areas, industry and multi-purpose roads.</P>
    <P>This upgrading of the road network will involve the by-passing of, and the removal of through-traffic from, many towns and villages.</P>
    <P>In the case of Dublin, the Dublin Port Tunnel when it is completed in 2004, will very significantly reduce the number of heavy goods vehicles using the city centre. A regional freight study is to be undertaken by the Dublin Transportation Office as part of its integrated transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area to 2016. This study will identify appropriate routes and identify measures for the better management of general goods distribution for freight trips to and from Dublin Port, Dún Laoghaire Port and Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>With regard to rail services, the review group on Iarnród Éireann which reported to the Minister for Public Enterprise on 4 July 2001 identified in its report, The Way Forward, a number of major questions to be addressed with regard to the future of the rail freight business and recommended that a more thorough study of the issues be commissioned as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I understand that this will now be pursued by the Department of Public Enterprise in the context of likely changes in freight transport, distribution and logistics and the particular contribution which rail freight can make to goods distribution and the alleviation of road congestion. The forthcoming report to be made to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources by the task force on port logistics will also deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with the question of rail freight.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 117, 519 and 565 to 567, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of recent events, the Government established a task force on emergency planning under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, which meets on a regular basis to ensure that preparations are in place for a co-ordinated response to possible nuclear, chemical or biological threats. In addition, the office of emergency planning has been established in the Department of Defence to take a lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat from international terrorism and from any escalation in international terrorism, including <Col N="424" /> co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies involved.</P>
    <P>This office is also exercising an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements now in place. The existing lead roles of Departments in respect of emergency planning for their own areas of responsibility remain in place.</P>
    <P>Major emergency planning in Ireland, which involves the broadest range of agencies, is based on a Government framework for a co-ordinated response of the front line agencies, that is, local authorities, including fire, the Garda, health services and also other agencies such as utilities and the voluntary sector who may be called on to assist.</P>
    <P>Major emergency plans are in place in all local authority areas and may be activated by the local authority, the Garda or health service. These plans are updated regularly by the authorities in the light of relevant developments, changes in contact details for agencies and personnel etc. and are exercised, including interagency exercises, periodically.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this emergency planning framework is effective. However, in the light of recent events, my Department has advised local authorities to review their major emergency plans and local plans, including plans for security and protection of water resources and drinking water supplies, to ensure that they are up to date and effective. Local authorities have also been advised that information about current plans should be available to all service providers and to the public. Under the general oversight of the Government task force, my Department recently issued guidance for the emergency services on response measures in the event of the release of chemical agents.</P>

      <P>My Department, through the local authorities, is providing record levels of capital funding for the upgrading of quality deficient, privately sourced group water schemes. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, £420 million, 533 million, will be invested in the upgrading and renewal of rural water services infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Last year I introduced a new 100% capital grant for the provision of essential water disinfection and treatment equipment in quality deficient group schemes, together with a substantial increase in the level of subsidy towards the operational cost of these facilities. At the same time I increased the grant for improvements to group water scheme storage and distribution systems to 85% of cost, subject to a maximum cost of £6,000 per house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the introduction of these new and improved grants, I made regulations in December 2000 which require group water schemes to meet the standards set out in the EU drinking water directive by end 2003. I have also secured <Col N="426" /> Government approval to bring forward a new Water Services Bill which will,<i> inter alia</i>, make statutory provision for a licensing system to regulate group water schemes and to set operational standards, including water quality standards.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing, I do not propose to provide grant assistance for individual water supplies where an alternative group scheme</P>
    <P>supply is available.</P>

      <P>The need for a particular focus on vulnerable road users, including cyclists, was a specific recommendation of the high level group on road safety in its second progress report on the Government strategy for road safety.</P>
      <P>The annual road accident facts reports prepared by the National Roads Authority reveal that in the last six years 119 cyclists have died as a result of traffic accidents, of which 37 were killed in Dublin. In 2000, the number of cyclists killed was ten which is the lowest number of fatalities reported in 40 years and comprises just 2.4% of all fatalities compared to 8% a decade ago. Of these ten fatalities, I understand that five were in respect of accidents involving goods vehicles with two of those occurring in Dublin.</P>

    <P>My Department, in association with the Dublin Transportation Office, has published a design manual for cycle facilities entitled provision of cycle facilities, National Manual for Urban Areas &ndash; March 1998, which was circulated to all local authorities. The manual is intended to assist local authorities to provide cycle facilities to a uniform and high standard. Ensuring the safety of cyclists <Col N="428" /> was an important consideration in developing the manual, which drew on international practice, particularly from the Netherlands and the UK. The manual sets out comprehensive guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities, specifically addresses the need for continuity in relation to cycle facilities and shows examples where this can be achieved with particular reference to the question of continuity through junctions and at pinch points. The DTO is now reviewing the cycle manual in the light of experience since 1998. All of the reports mentioned are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The recycling of post-consumer plastic beverage containers and other types of plastic packaging is generally more problematic than the recycling of other packaging materials, due to the light weight to volume ratio, sorting and pre-treatment requirements, high end market specifications and associated costs involved. Accordingly, the recycling rate of plastic packaging is generally lower than that of other packaging materials.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a number of operators collecting and carrying out initial reprocessing of plastic packaging containers. Information on these can be found in the recently published Recycling Directory of Ireland, which provides comprehensive information on material recyclers and reprocessors. A copy of this directory has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>A range of initiatives to expand recycling performance generally will be proposed in the forthcoming policy statement on preventing and recycling waste. In particular, it is intended to pursue a producer responsibility initiative for the collection and recovery of plastic packaging containers.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 571 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, which was published on 28 March 2001, has the principal purpose of providing for the introduction of a penalty points system. It is intended that this legislation will be debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas within the present year.</P>
      <P>In addition to new legislation, a number of other initiatives must be taken to facilitate the introduction and administration of a penalty points system. Section 25 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which will require full driving licence holders to carry their licences while driving, will be commenced at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The administration of the system will also need to be supported by the computerisation of the national driver file, NDF, which is currently being completed. In parallel with the completion of the NDF, a project team involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service has developed a business specification for a penalty points functionality to be added on to the NDF. The consultancy contract for taking this work forward has been awarded and it is intended that the necessary work for the addition of a penalty point functionality to the NDF will be completed by end 2001.</P>
      <P>The successful operation of the penalty points system will also depend on IT improvements being developed by the Garda Síochána and Courts Service in relation to fixed charge payments and court convictions for penalty point offences.</P>
      <P>In the context of the development of the proposed penalty points system, the operation of such systems in other countries, including the separate systems in Great Britain and Northern Ireland were examined. However, it must be recalled that the design of a penalty points system needs careful consideration in Irish circumstances because of the exclusive constitutional role of the courts in the administration of justice.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Traveller Accommo-</P>
      <P>dation) Act, 1998, requires local authorities in carrying out the statutory assessment of needs under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, to include a separate assessment for the needs for caravan sites for Travellers. The assessment must include the assessment of need for sites with limited facilities, normally referred to as transient sites, to take account of the annual pattern of movement of Travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1998 Act, each local authority is required to have regard to the need for transient sites as identified in its assessment of need in preparing its Traveller accommodation programme. The majority of programmes indicate that provision will be made for transient sites. Standards for transient sites were included in the guidelines <Col N="431" /> for accommodating transient Traveller families which were issued by my Department in June 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently written to all relevant local authorities stressing the need to progress implementation of all aspects of the accommodation programme, including the provision of transient facilities, and requesting that local authorities consult with adjoining authorities to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the provision of transient sites. My Department will be following up with local authorities to ensure progress in the provision of transient facilities, as part of its ongoing monitoring of progress in the implementation of the programmes generally.</P>
    <P>My Department will also prepare, in conjunction with the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, a protocol which will govern the management and operation of the sites by local authorities and the use of the sites by Traveller families.</P>
    <P>While a provision is included in the Local Government Act, 2001, enabling the Minister to reduce or withhold any grant or any other money due or otherwise payable to a local authority where it has failed or substantially failed to comply with a statutory duty, I have no proposal at this stage to resort to this power in relation to the provision of Traveller accommodation.</P>

      <P>As regards modern biotechnology and the environment, my Department's position is fully set out in the policy statement on genetically modified organisms and the environment issued following an extensive public consultation. The contained use of genetically modified organisms is regulated under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations, 2001, and the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms to the environment is regulated under the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994. The purpose of both regulations is environmental protection, including human health considerations arising in that context. The 1994 regulations will be replaced next year with new regulations transposing EU Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EPA is the competent authority for the 1994 and 2001 regulations, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no function in relation to individual notifications for the contained use of genetically modified organisms, or the release of such organisms into the environment for research and development pur<Col N="432" /> poses. Competent authority functions in EU environmental legislation on the marketing of genetically modified organisms are also a matter for the agency under the 1994 regulations. Where issues in relation to marketing notifications cannot be resolved at competent authority level, initiation of the relevant Community-level procedures, in accordance with EU legislation, is a matter for the European Commission.</P>
    <P>A wide range of biotechnology related issues and developments at national and international level were addressed in the report of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and issued in October 2000.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides for a total investment of £4.7 billion &ndash; 1999 prices &ndash; in national road improvement and maintenance over the period 2000-06, a threefold increase on the 1994-99 period. The NDP also sets out a strategic framework for the development of the national roads network over the coming seven years.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the NRA, within the NDP framework, to promote detailed programming of the work required and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
      <P>In the light of the planned expansion of the national roads programme, my Department has approved a range of staffing proposals, both at NRA and local authority levels, designed to ensure adequate organisational capacity to deliver the greatly expanded national roads programme envisaged by the NDP.</P>
      <P>While, in common with many other organisations, NRA and road authorities may experience some difficulties in recruiting staff for their purposes, good progress is being maintained with the development of the national roads network as mandated in the NDP, including on the five key inter-urban routes. A number of important projects have been completed this year, including Dunleer-Dundalk, M1, Southern Cross route, M50, Croom by-pass, N20, Kilmacthomas by-pass, N25, and Blackpool by-pass, N20.

      <P>Modernising waste management is an urgent priority, in order to support social and economic development and effective environmental protection. Access to adequate waste services and infrastructure is a significant consideration in investment decisions at both national and local level. Current shortcomings in this regard represent a potential impediment to continued inward investment, as well as a threat to environmental quality.</P>

      <P>Following the enactment of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001, all local authorities have now made waste management plans, most on a regional basis, and are now engaged in plan implementation. In addition, a national hazardous waste management plan was published by the Environmental Protection Agency in July.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 94 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, all planning authorities completed their housing strategies by the end July 2001 deadline.

To assist local authorities the Department issued guidelines and a model housing strategy in December 2000.

      <P>Housing strategies and other Part V provisions are one of the central elements of the Government's policy of increasing the supply of housing, making housing more affordable and promoting better social inclusion. Housing strategies are intended to bring greater order and certainty into how housing is planned and provided and as to the level of house building required in an area over the next few years, the type of housing needs to be catered for and the extent of zoned building land which may be required. All of this should make it easier for developers to plan and complete their building programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has written to planning authorities on a number of occasions asking that <Col N="437" /> they consider the adequacy of their staffing to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. In line with this concern, my Department has approved requests from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála for sanction for additional planner professional planner posts. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out by my Department of the larger local authority planning departments, that is, county councils and county borough corporations, carried out in July 2001 found that the overall number of serving staff, both administrative and professional, had increased to 1,210 which compared with a figure of 1,090 in January 2001, 1,066 in October 2000, 994 in July 2000 and 895 in September 1999. In relation to professional planners, the July 2001 survey identified the total number of serving professional planners at 346, an increase of some 40 since July 2000. Vacancies in this professional group nonetheless persist and must continue to be addressed.</P>
      <P>In relation to An Bord Pleanála, in July 2000 I approved an increase of 29 additional staff &ndash; nine professional planners and 20 administrative staff. An additional four administrative staff were approved in July 2001, bringing the authorised staff complement, excluding board members, to 138, an increase of 53 since July 1997. The board recently contracted 47 additional planners to work on a fee per case basis &ndash; 44 of these are UK based. In addition, seven private planning consultancy firms have been engaged by the board to provide professional reports on 600 smaller type appeals cases. Again the majority of these firms are UK based. To expand capacity at board level, I have increased the number of board members from ten to 12 and I am in the process of filling these posts. All of these measures should enable the board to make major inroads over the coming months into the backlog that has built up.</P>
      <P>A variety of measures have been taken to maximise the supply of professional planners to the planning authorities. At present, two third level institutions, University College Dublin and the Dublin Institute of Technology at Bolton Street offer third level planning courses. From September 2000, an increase in the capacity of the existing planning course at UCD and the introduction of new courses at both UCD and Dublin Institute of Technology will result in a trebling of the output of graduates from these courses to 75 per annum from next summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being pursued. In this regard, my Department along with a number of local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, participated in the FÁS Jobs Ireland Campaign earlier this year in the UK and South Africa to source professional planners on a contract basis. In the second phase of the recruitment campaign, the <Col N="438" /> Local Government Management Services Board has taken the lead role. An advertisement for agencies to sources construction professionals &ndash; planners, engineers, quantity surveyors, architects, etc. &ndash; for contract work was lodged in the Official Journal of the European Union in June. Proposals were received from 13 agencies and are currently being evaluated.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness includes a commitment that five local authorities would establish social inclusion units. In the event, I have decided that each of the local authorities involved in strand I of the Programme for Re-vitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development, RAPID programme, which focuses on disadvantage in urban areas, should have such units. This means that eight new units are being established, Dublin Corporation already having such a unit in place. The nine local authorities involved are as follows: Cork Corporation, Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council, Limerick Corporation, Louth County Council, South Dublin County Council, Waterford Corporation and Wicklow County Council.</P>
      <P>I have also decided to provide funding totalling £0.9 million per annum over a three year period to the nine local authorities concerned to support the work of these units. Recruitment of staff has commenced for all new units and it is expected that they will be in place by the end of this year or early 2002.</P>

      <P>The Companies (Fees) Order, 2001, S.I. No. 477 of 2001, provided for the introduction of a progressively increasing late filing fee where a company fails to file an annual return with the Registrar of Companies within the statutory due period. The order came into effect on 26 October 2001. Advance notice of the new late filing fees was heavily advertised by the Companies Registration Office.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, practitioners in this area would have been well aware, from the passage of the Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000, through the Oireachtas, of these and other proposals aimed at improving the level of compliance by Irish companies with their filing obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> Companies with their financial year ending on 31 December 2000 still have until 16 December 2001 to submit their annual return to the Companies Registration Office to avoid incurring a late filing penalty. Companies with a financial year ending later than 31 December 2000 will have even more time to submit their annual return without penalty &ndash; for example, companies with a financial year ending 31 March 2001 will have until mid March 2002 to submit their annual return without incurring a late filing penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of traders want to behave honourably and responsibly during the changeover to the euro. Many traders recognise that it makes good business sense to be in a position to start trading confidently in the new currency on 1 January and have taken the necessary steps to ensure that they will be in a position to do so. Retailers in particular will be in the front line during the changeover process and will have a crucial role to play in facilitating acceptance of the euro by consumers. Retailers, therefore, have a special responsibility to ensure that they have taken all the necessary steps to be ready to start trading in euros from 1 January.</P>
      <P>Now is the time for retailers, who have not already done so, to start using the extensive advice and support available to them through Government initiatives such as the Forfás Business Awareness Campaign, as well as the assistance of trade representative bodies such as IBEC, RGDATA and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, to prepare for the changeover.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the euro should not, of itself, require any trader to increase prices. Of course, it is open to any business to increase their prices if they want to do so. In the absence of a strict regime of price control that would require all price adjustments to be approved in advance there is no way of proving whether or not such increases are justified. Likewise it is open to traders to decrease prices, as presumably many will, during the period of the post Christmas sales. This is the norm in an open competitive market.</P>
      <P>The retail market, in particular, is highly competitive and at the end of the day those who seek to take advantage of the introduction to the euro to introduce unwarranted price increases will be punished by the market. Consumers need to realise the power that they themselves have if they feel they are not being treated fairly &ndash; and that is to take their business elsewhere. This is the ultimate sanction for any trader who seeks to take advantage of the changeover.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe that dual display of prices is the key to helping consumers and traders alike prepare for and become more confident in using the euro. Through exposure to dual display consumers can compare prices between Irish pounds and euros and build up a scale of values for themselves in the new currency. That is the objective of the national code of practice on dual display of prices. The benefits of co-operating together to ensure the smooth introduction of the euro have also been recognised by the groups of traders who participated in drawing up their own sectoral codes of practice on dual display of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large numbers of traders who have already signed up to the codes of practice are entitled to display a special logo approved by the Director <Col N="442" /> of Consumer Affairs as evidence of a commitment to carry out the changeover fairly. These traders recognise that it makes good business sense to be in a position to demonstrate to their customers that they have made a commitment not to seek any unfair advantage from the changeover. I strongly urge retailers in particular who have not yet done so to contact their trade association or the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs without any further delay and sign up to one of the codes of practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the recent Amnesty report titled, Ireland and the Arms Trade &ndash; Decoding the Deals. From the outset, I wish to reject totally the suggestion in the report that my Department's export controls system is designed to frustrate parliamentary scrutiny and careful attempts to discover the level and extent of exports of controlled goods. The Department operates one of the more transparent systems of reporting within the European Union. This was clearly recognised by a partner organisation of Amnesty &ndash; Saferworld. In a 2000 report entitled, Transparency and Accountability in European Arms Exports Controls, Saferworld concluded that, with regard to dual-use exports, the Irish system allows the greatest level of transparency, with the publication of monthly statistics on the Internet.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, always room for improvement. It is clear from the Amnesty report that many of their concerns regarding exports from Ireland of controlled goods arise in the context of the provision of information. I have asked my officials to examine how the information presented in this regard can be improved to increase further the level of transparency and address these concerns.</P>
      <P>The Amnesty report raises some further important issues in the area of export controls, for example, with regard to brokering, licensed production and end-use monitoring. These issues are the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs in the context of Ireland's participation in a number of international non-proliferation regimes and the EU.</P>
      <P>The two Departments have already taken steps to ensure that our practice of recording denial notifications in relation to exports of military goods is fully compliant with the requirements of the EU code of conduct.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into employment in the open labour market. Through CE, participants are provided with valuable opportunities for development and training. Participation is usually for a period of one to three years depending on the individuals' unem<Col N="444" /> ployment record and age when commencing on the programme.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on CE are being mainstreamed. This process involves the transfer of CE funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for these services. The short-term nature of participation on CE is not compatible with the needs of certain sectors of the community, including personal assistant services where a continuity of care is required. The proposed mainstreaming would have positive implications for the provision of these services in the future in terms of creating more permanent funding conditions for their delivery.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children, which has primary responsibility for funding in this area, is supportive of the proposal in principle, and the two Departments, in consultation with FÁS, are now looking at the modalities involved. I hope that these discussions can be completed as soon as possible enabling the proposed new funding arrangements to be put in place by Department of Health and Children at an early date.</P>

      <P>The management of industrial property and its marketing to suitable overseas companies is a day to day matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that since January 1999, there have been nine site visits to the Kilbarry Industrial Park, which have been arranged by IDA Ireland for prospective foreign direct investment projects.</P>
      <P>There are three IDA Ireland assisted companies operating in the park &ndash; Yves Roches, Flextronics and Option International &ndash; which employ a total of 671 people. Flextronics announced an expansion to create 300 jobs in April 2000 and has completed the building for this expansion. Option International was located elsewhere in the city and relocated to the Kilbarry Industrial Park in March 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also two Enterprise Ireland client companies located on the park &ndash; Seamar Chemicals and Techsources Manufacturing Limited. The Kilbarry Industrial Park is a very important part of the industrial infrastructure in the Cork region and Enterprise Ireland brings it to the <Col N="445" /> attention of any indigenous Irish manufacturing company seeking suitable premises in the Cork area or to manufacturing companies wishing to expand outside Dublin City. Approximately ten inquiries are received by Enterprise Ireland each year resulting in about six visits to the park.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has recently received planning permission for the construction of three new buildings in the park, which will come on stream as demand requires, reflecting IDA Ireland's active involvement with the park.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is the designated managing authorities for two of the operational programmes under the national development plan. These are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme. My Department is also responsible for a number of measures under the regional operational programmes. Measures in the operational programmes are administered by the State agencies under the aegis of my Department. Expenditure broken down at county level is not available. The information below shows the expenditure allocated and spent in the two regions.</P>
      <P>As regards the southern and eastern region, under the productive sector operational programme, the agencies involved in implementing measures are IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. The allocation of spending in the southern and eastern region by these agencies in 2000 was 264.1 million and of this 38.2 million was spent. The allocation for the full year 2001 is 477 million and provisional returns from the agencies indicate that 78.6 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While expenditure, under the productive sector operational programme by the development agencies has been less than forecast, their expenditure on investment and other programmes overall is on target. There is a number of reasons for the low expenditure on the productive sector operational programme. Expenditure was still continuing in 2000-01 in respect of commitments made up to the end of 1999 under the industry operational programme 1994-99. In addition, there was a considerable delay in a number of measures in obtaining State aid approval from the European Commission. Also with new schemes there is an inevitable time-lag from the launch of schemes to the receipt and evaluation of proposals and the incurring of expenditure. It is anticipated that the level of expenditure under <Col N="446" /> the programme will come on target over the next two years.</P>
    <P>Under the employment and human resources development operational programme the agencies involved in implementing measures are FÁS and Enterprise Ireland. The allocation for spending in the southern and eastern region under the operational programme by these agencies in 2000 was 636.91 million and of this 514.09 million was spent. The allocation for the full year 2001 is 636.67 million and provisional returns from the agencies indicate that 285.931 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the regional operational programmes the County Enterprise Boards are responsible for implementing the measure. The allocation for spending in the southern and eastern region in 2000 was 18.9 million and of this 18.6 million was spent. The allocation for the full year 2001 is 20.1 million of which 8.8 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>
    <P>As regards the Border, midland and western region, under the productive sector operational programme the agencies involved in implementing measures are IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. The allocation of spending in the BMW region by these agencies in 2000 was 158 million and of this 8.2 milllion was spent. The allocation for spending in 2001 is 203.7 million and provisional returns from the agencies indicate that 21.2 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>
    <P>Again expenditure, under the productive sector operational programme by the development agencies has been less than forecast, their expenditure on investment and other programmes overall is on target and again the same reasons apply as in the southern and eastern region. There was a considerable delay in a number of measures in obtaining State aid approval from the European Commission. Also with new schemes, there is an inevitable time lag from the launch of schemes to the receipt and evaluation of proposals and the incurring of expenditure. In addition, expenditure was still continuing in 2000-01 in respect of commitment made up to the end of 1999 under the industry operational programme 1994-99. It is anticipated that the level of expenditure under the programme will increase over the next two years.</P>
    <P>Under the employment and human resources development operational programme, the agencies involved in implementing measures are FÁS and Enterprise Ireland. The allocation for spending in the BMW region under the operational programme by these agencies in 2000 was 247.69 million and of this 220.11 million was spent. The allocation for spending in 2001 is 242.63 million and provisional returns from the agencies indicate that 116.5 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the regional operational programmes the county enterprise boards are responsible for implementing the measure. The allocation for spending in the BMW region in 2000 was 11 <Col N="447" /> million and of this 10.8 million was spent. The allocation for spending for the full year 2001 is 10.8 million of which 4.8 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the closure of the company, the Government approved, at my request, a proposal to seek funding from the European Coal and Steel Community, ECSC, to enhance the statutory entitlements of workers made redundant as a result of the closure of the company. My Department then applied to the European Commission for the maximum available amount of 3,000, £2,362.69, per worker of ECSC re-adaptation aid under Article 56(2)(f2&gt;b) of the ECSC Treaty for the workers and also for certain on-site contract workers who were made redundant as a result of the closure of the company and who qualify for aid under ECSC rules due to the nature of the work carried out by them.</P>
      <P>I have also obtained agreement from the European Commission to change a provision in a 1991 convention between Ireland and the European Commission on terms and conditions for the granting of aid provided for in Article 56(2)(b) of the ECSC Treaty. Before this amendment was made to the 1991 convention, workers over a certain age would only have qualified for aid on the condition that they retired permanently from economic activity.</P>
      <P>It is expected that a formal decision on the application will be made by the European Commission later this month. If the Commission's decision is favourable, it is expected that the funds would be transferred by the Commission to my Department a few weeks after the formal decision, which would mean that the funds might be available for disbursement to the workers by my Department in December, at the very earliest. However, I should emphasise that this is the minimum estimated timeframe and it is very possible that the funds would not be available until early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the conditions for receipt of ECSC aid is that the member state concerned should pay a special contribution to the redundant workers which would at least match the amount to be paid by the Commission. The Government has already <Col N="448" /> agreed to the provision of this matching funding and I intend to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in the Dáil at the earliest opportunity to finance the matching payments of 3,000, £2,362.69, per worker. I am confident that my Department will be in a position to issue these matching payments to the workers before Christmas.</P>

Amounts in respect of interest and expenses are also not included above. At present I have no plans to amend the legislation governing the insurance compensation fund.

      <P>Under the Community Trade Mark Directive (89/104/EEC), Governments are entitled to object to trade marks that consist exclusively of indications of geographical origin. The purpose of such objection is to protect the rights of other traders and exporters by preventing any single company from obtaining a monopolistic right to a place name such as the name of a country. In this regard, any decision I would take to object to the registration of a trade mark exclusively indicative of Irish origin would be taken regardless of which part of the island of Ireland the goods were produced in. In the case to which the Deputy refers, I considered that the three trade marks in the applications in question consisted exclusively of indications of geographical origin, and my objection was made on this basis.</P>
      <P>In addition to these three applications, the company concerned has four other trade mark applications, and two previously registered trade marks, which are the subject of objection by the Irish Dairy Board. These objections are at the appeal stage. While I am not a party to the appeal, I did express concerns to the Greek authorities in relation to aspects of the cases.</P>
      <P>Apart from the nature of the trade marks, I was concerned at the use of the shamrock. The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property protects the shamrock from registration in any of its member countries, including Greece, save with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. No application for consent has been received. I am also concerned that where trade marks contain elements that are indicative of Irish origin, but not exclusively so, they should not be deceptive as to origin. In the case that the Deputy has raised, I have been informed that the Greek company in question is using trade marks indicative of Irish origin on produce from outside the island of Ireland. The use of a trade mark indicative of Irish origin on produce from Northern Ireland is, of course, not at issue.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that over the past three years over 200 industrial jobs have been lost in Ballinamore, County Leitrim; and the plans her Department have for putting in place the provision of industrial jobs to Ballinamore in the next number of months. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that over 200 jobs have been lost in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, over the past three years. When Ballinamore Textiles closed in 1998 with the loss of approximately 180 jobs, I established the Leitrim task force under the chairmanship of Mr. Paddy Fahy, the then county manager. My Department's industrial development agencies participated in this task force, which reported to me in May 1999.</P>
      <P>As part of this report, IDA Ireland, the agency under my Department's aegis with responsibility for the attraction of overseas investment, stated that its target location in County Leitrim was Carrick-on-Shannon. As a result of the report, IDA Ireland set about targeting new business for Leitrim and MBNA was approved support to set up a contact centre in Carrick-on-Shannon with a target of 300 jobs in a new state of the art facility. The first phase of the building has been completed and 150 people have been recruited, which is ongoing at this time. The agency continues to market Leitrim for new business and has reached agreement with the new owners of Emerald Star to establish a small contact centre &ndash; five jobs in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
      <P>As part of the task force, IDA Ireland agreed to the construction of a new 24,000 square foot advance building in Carrick-on-Shannon, which is currently nearing completion and is being marketed by IDA Ireland for new business. Enterprise Ireland, which is the agency under my Department's aegis with responsibility for the development of indigenous industry, is promoting a number of initiatives designed to increase the job creation potential in Ballinamore. Enterprise Ireland has and will continue to promote Ballinamore to potential investors or company expressing an interest in relocating or starting up a business in the area. The agency's north-west regional office promoted County Leitrim at the recent Into the Regions event held to promote regional locations to east coast companies planning to expand their businesses. The agency is currently dealing with a number of potential investors arising from this event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the range of initiatives which Enterprise Ireland is promoting in the Ballinamore area are the hosting of business seminars, venture capital schemes, cross-border initiatives and support for the establishment of an enterprise centre. The agency is currently in discussion with Ballinamore Ballyconnell Canal Community Development Company Limited, <Col N="451" /> trading as Ballinamore Development Company, with regard to developing a new enterprise centre in the region, and has recently submitted a business plan to Enterprise Ireland's north-west regional office. The provision of an enterprise centre will help facilitate the development of new enterprises with a view to the creation of more jobs in the area.</P>

      <P>The difficulties being experienced by businesses in getting public liability insurance are attributable to a number of factors. There has certainly been a contraction in the number of players on the market in the past few years. The insurance cycle is also in that phase where prices increase. Moreover, I understand that the events of 11 September have accelerated price increases and have caused re-insurers to review the cover they are prepared to offer to insurers. All of this is felt by the consumer in the forms of higher prices and curtailed availability of cover.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to intervene in the matter of pricing or underwriting of insurance. I would encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of ameliorating the worst effects of the current circumstances, for instance, by better management of risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a salmon farming operation in Killary Harbour and a former salmon farming operation at Portside, Inver Bay, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>All marine salmon farming operations are subject to regular inspection under the national sea lice monitoring programme which is overseen by the Marine Institute. Sea lice levels are set with the objective of maintaining levels as close to zero as practicable. The levels determine the use of approved targeted treatment regimes. Irish lice control parameters are the most stringent of all salmon producing countries.</P>
      <P>Licence conditions pertaining to the Killary operation set down specific thresholds for average levels of egg bearing lice. These limits are more stringent than those set down under the national monitoring programme. In the case of the Killary operation, the Department notes that the lice threshold was exceeded by the company in early March 2000 primarily because of delays in the availability of a new sea lice treatment, due to reasons beyond the company's control. The Department is satisfied that the company took immediate and effective corrective action to reduce lice levels below the threshold laid down in the aquaculture licence and that lice levels at the farm have since that time remained below that threshold. The Department continues to keep sea lice limits at salmon farms under general review and to closely monitor the levels on all farms.</P>
      <P>Under regional programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 £25 million in EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to aquaculture development. Grant aid in the amount of approximately £750,000 was recently approved for the Killary operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision by the Minister of State to grant a ten year aquaculture licence for the Portside operation in February 1999 followed consideration of an application which was supported by a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement which was published. That decision was appealed by third parties to the independent statutory Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board. The operation's short-term trial licence for salmon cultivation, which was granted in March 1999, expired in February 2000. In March 2000, ALAB decided to uphold the appeals against the grant of an aquaculture licence for the Portside operation. The operator indicated to the Department that he was considering making an application to the High Court for a judicial review of ALAB's decision, as he was specifically entitled to do under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. The time limit for doing so ran out in June 2000. In the event, however, the operator did not pursue the option of judicial review and advised the Department that he would harvest the fish within <Col N="456" /> weeks as soon as they would be ready for harvesting. Harvesting was completed in July 2000. It will be appreciated that harvesting of farmed fish generally takes some weeks to complete, being influenced by key factors such as market availability, weather, labour, equipment and processing availability, etc.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to irregularities as defined by European Council Regulation 2988/95. I am aware of a possible irregularity relating to the provision of funding under the harvesting sub-measure of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, OPARDF, 1994-1999. The alleged irregularity was discovered by my Department in February 2000. The Department of Finance was notified in May 2000 and advised the European Commission of the alleged irregularity in June 2000. Payment of grant assistance was suspended pending further inquiries. Such inquiries are continuing. I have no knowledge of any other alleged irregularities.</P>

      <P>Public investment, excluding private contribution, of over £1 billion has been provided <Col N="457" /> under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 in respect of the marine and natural resources sectors. This investment is spread across the two regional operational programmes, BMW and South and East, the three inter-regional or sectoral operational programmes, the rural development programme and the cross-Border initiatives. It is not possible at this time and within the time available to provide a breakdown on a county basis of expenditure to date by my Department under the NDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, and other NDP implementing bodies, are at present rolling out the installation of an NDP computerised reporting system that <Col N="458" /> will, among other matters, provide details of expenditure on a county basis. Much expenditure, such as that on marketing, training and RTDI, can only be attributed indicatively on a county basis. In addition, NDP allocations by county were not made in so far as the programmes administered by my Department are concerned. While the disaggregation by county of expenditure to date by the Department under the NDP cannot at present be provided I am providing, in the table below, details on a regional &ndash; BMW and South and East &ndash; basis of allocations and actual public expenditure to date under the plan.</P>

The analysis confirmed than the material was organic to nature but there is no evidence of its source or origin. No algae were detected. I stress that, because of current movements, the material could have originated outside the area. I have no information to suggest that the slick was harmful and I am advised by my officials that there is no evidence of the slick at present. Should any material from the slick have drifted onto the beaches, the clean up is a matter for the local authority.

      <P>The implications of the Kyoto Protocol and its mechanisms are among the issues which international donors must take into account in planning their activities under the environment related headings of their development co-operation programmes. The clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol allows developed countries to gain reduction credits on their own national obligations to reduce emissions, by investing in projects that will reduce emissions in developing countries. The Government has decided, however, that we will not adjust our development <Col N="462" /> co-operation priorities in order to facilitate the achievement of domestic commitments arising from the Kyoto Protocol.</P>

      <P>The Government would be opposed to the use of force in any effort to resolve the issue of Taiwan. In this regard, I have been encouraged by a recent major policy address by President Jiang Zemin, at the Commemoration of the 90th Anniversary of the Revolution of 1911 on 9 October 2001, in which he clearly committed China to pursuing the reintegration of Taiwan by peaceful means on the basis of the one-China principle.</P>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments have accepted the one-China principle, as have the overwhelming majority of UN members and our EU partners. During the EU-China summit in September this year, China reiterated its principled position on the settlement of the Taiwan question in accordance with the basic principle of &ldquo;peaceful reunification and one country, two systems&rdquo;. I hope that the parties will be able to find a way to initiate dialogue at an early date.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach met with Premier Zhu Rongji, during the Chinese State visit in September and raised the case of the detention in China of Trinity College student Zhao Ming. Premier Zhu gave a commitment to convey the interest of the Irish Government and people on this case to the Chinese judicial authorities. The Irish Embassy in Beijing has been following the case of Zhao Ming and has been informed by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that, arising from Premier Zhu's statement, the concern of the Irish authorities had been brought to the attention of the Chinese judicial authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Zhao Ming is apparently a member of the body known as Falun Gong, which was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999. He is a Chinese citizen and therefore subject to the laws of China while in that country, including those in respect <Col N="463" /> of Falun Gong. As he is not an Irish citizen, Ireland has no consular function in this matter. This matter currently rests with the Chinese judicial authorities. I will report to the Dáil on this subject as I receive further information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Security Council in its Resolution 1360 of 3 July 2001, and in previous Resolutions, has given the UN Secretary General a mandate to pursue consultations with the Government of Iraq. The Secretary General, the Security Council and the UN office of the Iraq programme have repeatedly sought Iraqi co-operation to address the obstacles to alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people. Ireland, as a member of the Security Council, has been fully supportive of those efforts.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue with the UN Secretary General on 29 October during my most recent visit to New York, including the question of his continuing to explore with the Iraqi Government the prospects for both the improved implementation and reform of the sanctions regime, and the eventual suspension of the regime in the context of Iraq's compliance with the council's demands that it allow United Nations arms inspectors to verify that it is not engaged in the production of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. However, to date, Iraq has not shown that it is willing to engage seriously with the UN.</P>
      <P>Iraq has failed to place a single order for medicines in the first six months of 2000. Despite the criticisms contained in the Secretary General's latest report of slow contracting and other obstacles to the implementation of the humanitarian programme caused by Iraq, the government of Iraq has not furnished any reason to account for its failure to place such orders in a timely fashion. It would be for the UN office of the Iraq programme to pursue this matter with the Iraqi authorities.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as a member of the Security Council, has deplored the failure of the government of Iraq to co-operate effectively with the programme and to serve the interests and needs of its own people. We have called on Iraq to co-operate fully with the UN, and to meet all of its responsibilities and commitments under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council so that sanctions can be suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> At the same time, I believe that there are immediate steps which the members of the Security Council could take to improve the humanitarian and long-term situation of the people of Iraq. I would, in particular, like to see rapid progress in negotiations to place the sanctions regime on a new basis. The Security Council has under consideration a revised system for the importation of goods into Iraq, under which all goods could be freely imported except for those on a narrowly focused list of items that are considered to have possible military application, which would still need the approval of the Iraq Sanctions Committee. This would do away with many of the current, cumbersome procedures. Additionally, the new regime would greatly facilitate action in the Iraq Sanctions Committee, in that the practice of certain member states of placing an unreasonably high number of holds on contracts would no longer apply.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it has not been possible so far to reach the necessary level of agreement in the Security Council on these reforms. We have been active with fellow members of the Council at a number of levels in urging flexibility. The issue is due to be considered again by the Council at the end of this month.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers, entitled &ldquo;Still beyond the Pale . . . ?&rdquo;, was commissioned by the Irish Housing Forum in London to analyse the response of social landlords to the specific housing and health needs of London's Irish community. CARA is one of the four organisations which make up the Irish Housing Forum. Among the main recommendations of the Report are that local authorities ensure that there is an Irish dimension to all equality policies, that local authorities and housing associations should do this by monitoring lettings to Irish people with a view to increasing the allocations of social housing to Irish people and that existing and new funding programmes should look specifically at the need to meet Irish needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report was officially launched by the then Irish Ambassador in London on 20 July this year. The Ambassador underlined the usefulness of developing co-operation between groups serving the Irish community and local and central government bodies in Britain. The report was prepared with the support of the British Housing Corporation and the British Commission for Racial Equality. Their representatives attended the launch as did a wide range of Irish community <Col N="465" /> organisations including the Federation of Irish Societies and the Action Group for Irish Youth. The embassy brought the report to the attention of the Interdepartmental Committee on Emigration on 19 July in advance of its publication on the following day.</P>
    <P>The Irish community organisations themselves have a central role to play in achieving the objectives of the report. In addition to their efforts, the embassy has met with representatives of the Irish Housing Forum to discuss ways in which the embassy can help to bring the recommendations of the report to the attention of the appropriate central government authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>Plans to protect and safeguard British nuclear installations, including Sellafield, from terrorist attacks are a matter for the UK government and relevant authorities in the UK. According to the UK Department of Trade and Industry, with whom the Irish Embassy in London has been in touch, the UK civil nuclear industry is strictly regulated and meets all international and national requirements. The UK's civil nuclear sites apply stringent security measures regulated by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security, the UK security regulator. The security regulator works closely with the Health and Safety Executive, the UK safety regulator, which provides advice on the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes, at nuclear installations. Security and safety precautions at nuclear sites are kept under regular review. Both regulators are reviewing all relevant precautions in the light of the recent terrorist attacks in the USA. It is not, <Col N="466" /> as I understand it, UK government policy to disclose details of security measures taken at civil nuclear sites.</P>
      <P>As regards the response in Ireland, to any attack on an installation, I would like to refer the Deputy to my reply to Dáil Question No. 111 on 25 October 2001 and Dáil Question No. 85 on 17 October 2001, in which I gave details of the Irish Government's national emergency plan for nuclear accidents; details of the international and EU procedures for early notification of a nuclear accident and the bilateral arrangements which exist between Ireland and the UK whereby the UK authorities would notify us of nuclear accidents or incidents.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defence has been given overall responsibility by the Government for emergency planning in regard to any potential terrorist attack on Ireland or any attack likely to affect Ireland. In this connection, an office of emergency planning has been established in that Department and is working with key Departments, including my Department, to co-ordinate a full response to any emergency.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Dáil Question No. 208 of 16 October 2001, the draft final report of the Cork area strategic plan proposes, among other things, the development of commuter rail services between Blarney and Midleton operating <i>via</i> Kent Station and the construction of a number of stations in between. However, a rail service to Youghal is not envisaged under the plan at this stage. I understand that Cork Corporation and Cork County Council have recently adopted the plan. Iarnród Éireann expects shortly to put out to tender the undertaking of a detailed feasibility study so that all aspects of the rail proposals can be examined in depth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the seven years of the national development plan, it is proposed to invest £2.2 billion, 2.8 billion, in public transport. The Greater Dublin Area will benefit from a £1.6 billion, 2.03 billion, investment in public transport and £650 million, 825 million, is being allocated under the NDP proposals to address regional transport requirements.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the expenditure to date on a county by county basis. However, overall to end-June 2001, almost £451 million, 573 million has been spent on public transport projects. The main objectives of the investment is to upgrade the mainline rail infrastructure, rolling stock and facilities; upgrade the suburban rail and DART network; develop the light rail network; develop the bus services in Dublin, in the major provincial cities and towns and to develop and improve rural bus services. These combined objectives will be achieved through: mainline rail investment in safety and renewal; enhanced suburban rail services through increased capacity on the DART and outer suburban rail services; increased frequency of suburban rail services; introduction of the LUAS services in 2003; regional bus improvements (provincial cities, rural and main routes from and to Dublin; Dublin city bus improvements; ongoing fleet replacement and re-equipment by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath; and accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities.</P>
      <P>The NDP monitoring committee established by my Department, which includes representatives from the CIE Group and the Department of Finance, is responsible for overseeing progress, both financial and physical, of the public transport projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the airports measure of the national development plan, a sum of £14 million, 17.8 million (1999 prices) has been allocated to assist <Col N="476" /> with necessary infrastructural upgrades and improvements at the six regional airports in Ireland. The allocation is £6 million, 7.62 million for the two regional airports in the S&amp;E region at Farranfore, (Kerry) and Waterford and £8 million, 10.16 million for the four regional airports in the BMW region at Carrickfin (Donegal), Galway, Knock and Sligo.</P>
    <P>There has been no expenditure to date of this amount. However, my Department is currently examining and assessing the projects which have been submitted for support under the NDP by the six regional airport authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Under the sustainable energy priority within the framework of the national development plan, £113.7 million, 144.4 million is earmarked for investment in the south and east region and £61.5 million, 78.1 million in the Border, midland and western region. My Department has overall responsibility for the administration of this funding and the Irish Energy Centre which operates under the aegis of my Department, is the main conduit for implementing this Priority. While expenditure to date in 2001 of £2.35 million, 2.99 million has been incurred in the south and east region, this would also have an impact in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>Under the communications measure of the national development plan, an amount of £43.4 million, 55.1 million was allocated in 2001. As the projects involved are infrastructual projects spanning many counties, no county breakdown is available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> I have been advised by Iarnród Éireann that work on the track between Dublin and Maynooth cost approximately £43 million, 55 million, including the provision of 20 additional diesel railcars which were delivered to Iarnród Éireann to provide enhanced services on the route. Of the total amount invested in the line, 65% came from European Union and 35% from Exchequer funds. Some additional work in relation to level crossings and stations is proceeding satisfactorily and Iarnród Éireann has advised me that this work will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed me that the full service is now in operation and there are 24 services each way daily between 06.40 hours and 23.10 hours, and that there is approximately a 100% increase in peak hour capacity.</P>
    <P>In terms of return on investment, the project has added significantly to the level and quality of service on this corridor which is consistent with the Dublin Transportation Office's long-term strategy for developing public transport in the greater Dublin area.</P>

The security committee includes the Secretaries General to the Government, the Depart<Col N="481" /> ment of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Defence, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>A high level contact group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the Government Departments immediately concerned, was set up to monitor developments. The emergency services, under their aegis, were asked to ensure their arrangements were fully up to date.</P>
    <P>Since then the security committee has met on a number of occasions and the high level contact group has met regularly. At the Government meeting on 18 September 2001, arising from a report of the high level contact group, Ministers were asked to ensure that all necessary measures were being taken to monitor and respond to the evolving international situation.</P>
    <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is taking place. The attacks on the US have clearly changed the context for such emergency planning. Since the 1980s, the emphasis in planning was on peacetime emergencies, whereas now we are faced with new threats arising from international terrorism. In those circumstances the Government decided on 2 October 2001, to set up an office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>The new office is taking the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat from international terrorism and from any escalation in international tensions, including co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies involved; and, exercising an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements.</P>
    <P>The existing lead role of Departments in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will of course continue. At the request of the Taoiseach, I am chairing an emergency planning task force established to oversee emergency planning in light of the current international climate. The task force held its first meeting on 18 October 2001, which the Taoiseach attended, along with the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise. The task force comprises senior representatives from all of the key Departments and agencies charged with responsibility for emergency planning.</P>
    <P>The task force has been meeting regularly to review the various emergency planning and response issues. A further meeting was held this morning, the next meeting is scheduled for 8 November 2001, and further meetings are scheduled for next week. The establishment of this emergency planning task force and the setting up of an office of emergency planning at the Department of Defence and the ongoing work being done by Departments and agencies clearly shows <Col N="482" /> the serious commitment of the Government to providing a co-ordinated and effective response to situations such as those that have arisen recently.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that, in the interests of security, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific measures taken or being undertaken to guard against or to counter such terrorist attacks. As I have mentioned in the House already on 18 October 2001, the National Civil Aviation Security Committee (NCASC), which is chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise and which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, civil and military representatives from my Department, has convened eight special meetings to date since the events in the US. At those meetings, the NCASC has been reviewing existing aviation security procedures for Irish aviation in the light of the current security situation and is examining specific security proposals. As regards the handling of a hijacked aircraft, procedures have been agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) for the exchange of relevant information between member states.</P>
    <P>As I also indicated to the House on 18 October 2001, in light of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States I am having the question of acquiring training aircraft with interceptor capability for the Air Corps examined.</P>

      <P>The military authorities advise that it is not possible to identify the precise number of incidents of suicide relating to persons who are serving members of the Defence Forces. This arises from the fact that inquest verdicts are not forwarded to the military authorities as a matter of routine administration. In other words, it would be necessary to review the inquest verdicts of every case of the death of a member of the Defence Forces, where an inquest was applicable, in order to ascertain this information.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;para-suicide&rdquo; encompasses a very wide range of self-harmful behaviour and acts. No specific database which can be studied to ascertain with accuracy the incidences of para-suicide within the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces have had formal policies and procedures on sexual harassment and bullying in place since February 1996 and these are outlined in an administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships. Lectures and briefings in this area have continued over the years as an integral element of the training syllabus on recruit, cadet and career courses, and in addition on those occasions when troops are undergoing training for duty overseas.</P>
      <P>Early this year, the Defence Forces commenced a re-examination of procedures to bring them into line with the best state of the art practice in both the wider public service and in the private sector. In April, the section in the administrative instruction, which deals with the procedures concerning allegations of bullying, was revised to reflect this. The report of the Government Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, published in March of this year, requires all public and private organisations to reassess their policies. The Defence Forces will actively participate in this review and re-assessment exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All incidents of sexual harassment brought to the attention of the military authorities are <Col N="484" /> thoroughly investigated. Additional procedures are also being put in place by the Chief of Staff. Each barracks will have a female liaison officer, known and available to all females in barracks. Each formation commander will arrange women's days on a periodic basis to cover issues such as interpersonal relationships and women's health issues.</P>
    <P>An internal information campaign of posters, and a simplified &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; booklet, will convey the essential message of the administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships. Briefings and open discussions with mixed gender attendance are to be conducted by formation commanders and will continue on a periodic basis. I am satisfied that the military authorities are quite properly emphasising again the serious nature of this subject for all personnel. The importance of establishing the proper environment cannot be over emphasised. The Chief of Staff has stated that commanders at all levels should bear in mind that it is a command responsibility to ensure that the military environment is free from any form of sexual harassment and bullying. He has further stated that any failure by a commander to ensure that such is the case, or to deal adequately with complaints of sexual harassment or bullying, would be considered a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>The Chief of Staff has established a special military steering group to examine these issues. I invited Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, to join the group as an expert civilian chairperson. Her task is to determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures, and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area. She has been joined by two other civilian experts, who previously worked with her on the original Government task force, and by senior military personnel, including the Deputy Chief of Staff, Support, and a senior female Army officer. Dr. Doyle and the joint civilian &ndash; military group will now proceed to produce a report by March 2002. The Defence Forces fully recognise that the singular nature of the military environment does not give anyone a general licence for bullying or harassment of any kind. Such behaviour will not be tolerated.</P>

      <P>Since the first confirmed case of Foot and Mouth Disease in Great Britain on 21 February, my Department, in co-operation with a range of other Departments and agencies, has had measures in place to prevent the spread of FMD from Great Britain to this jurisdiction. These measures, including disinfection and other arrangements at Dublin Port, have been singularly successful in limiting the number of FMD cases in this State to just one.</P>
      <P>I am already on record as expressing, on my own behalf and on behalf of the community at large, our gratitude to staff from all agencies, including the Garda Síochána, whose commitment and perseverance in playing their part to protect this country against the FMD threat has been unswerving. I have no doubt that there is agreement that the measures employed were absolutely necessary in the face of a crisis, not just for the agriculture sector, but for the economy generally.</P>
      <P>In relation to the incident at Dublin Port referred to by the Deputy, this involved a number of motor cyclists, including several off duty members of An Garda Síochána, coming from a motor cycle meeting in Great Britain by ferry, and related to the disinfection of their vehicles and the clothing they were wearing. One of the individuals concerned has made an official complaint and the matter is at present being looked into by the customer service section of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, perhaps, inevitable, in the context of a national emergency involving the imposition of <Col N="486" /> additional controls and a measure of unavoidable inconvenience on the many thousands of travellers coming from Great Britain and elsewhere, that there would be a limited number of cases where individuals were unhappy.</P>
    <P>In this instance, and quite properly, the matter in question is being dealt with under the formal customer complaints procedures established by my Department. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate mechanism through which to deal with such issues.</P>

      <P>The main element in the EU Commission's proposals for reform of the sheepmeat regime is that the current variable ewe premium should be replaced by a fixed ewe premium of 21. In the negotiations on the reform my aim is to ensure that the best possible support regime is put in place for Irish sheep producers. In the discussions I have been pressing for the fixed premium to be set at a level which ensures a reasonable income for sheep producers and bears some relationship with the premium payable in other sectors. I am also anxious to ensure that the new supplementary premium, which replaces the rural world premium, continues to be paid to all existing beneficiaries in disadvantaged areas. The question of the introduction of an extensification premium for sheep producers in the context of the reform of the regime has also been raised by me. </P>

      <P>The person named applied on 13 cows and one heifer under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme persons with more than 15 livestock units must submit an area aid application if they wish to be paid in excess of 15 livestock units. As the person named did not submit a 2001 area aid application and as he has already been paid on 2.25 livestock units under the 2001 ewe premium scheme his payment under the 2001 suckler cow scheme is limited to 12.75 livestock units or 13.15 animals.</P>
      <P>Therefore the 80% suckler cow premium entitlement to the person named is £1,707.98. An amount of £1,029.74 has been recouped from this in respect of arrears of annuity that are owed to the Land Commission and payment for £678.24 issued on 26 October 2001.</P>
      <P>A herdowner must submit a valid area aid application for the relevant year in order to be considered for payment of disadvantaged areas compensatory allowances scheme.

      <P>The person named was paid suckler cow premium for 2000 on a total of 37 animals. A post-payment cross-check revealed that one on the animals listed on the application had been disposed of within the six months' retention period and that he had not notified the Department either of the disposal of the animal or of its replacement. He was requested to clarify the position and if he had replaced the animal, to submit his bovine herd register and the cattle identity card of the replacement for examination. He submitted the cattle identity card of a replacement animal but did not submit the bovine herd register. A reminder to forward the bovine herd register was sent to him on 17 May 2001 but no reply was received. The matter has now been reviewed in the light of the new CMMS database and it has been decided that the suckler cow premium payment for 2000 is in order. The extensification premium for 2000 which was held up pending the receipt of the bovine herd register will be issued shortly.</P>
      <P>In mid-January 2001 all registered herdowners were sent EXPR.1 Forms on which they were asked to indicate their wish to participate in 2001 extensification premium. The closing date for receipt of the EXPR.1s was Friday, 16 February 2001. On 12 March 2001 those herdowners who had not returned their EXPR.1s by 16 February 2001 closing date were sent reminder letters requesting them to indicate if they wished to participate in the premium. They were requested to reply within seven days of receipt of the letter. The Department continued to accept EXPR.1 Forms up until 22 May 2001, the final date under EU regulations by which requests to participate in 2001 extensification premium had to be received.

      <P>My Department is currently represented on an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of Finance, which is currently examining the best location in the longer term for responsibility for legislation which requires the services of a professional veterinarian. At present, in so far as the discharge of food safety related functions at premises slaughtering animals and processing foodstuff for the home market is concerned, each local authority is responsible to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland under service contract arrangements. The work of the interdepartmental group is ongoing and, when finalised, its conclusions will form the basis for decisions which will be made at Government level on the longer-term future of this service following expiry of the current service contracts at the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>As regards funding, under relevant legislation &ndash; the Abattoirs Act, 1988 &ndash; each local authority was given responsibility to recover costs either partially, or wholly, through fees imposed on premises subject to inspection by them. However, since it became evident in late 1996 that many local authorities had to varying degrees not been fully discharging their statutory functions in this area &ndash; linked at least in part to their inability to recover the requisite costs from the industry &ndash; Exchequer assistance has, with Government approval, been paid through my Department's Vote. These <i>ad hoc</i> funding arrangements have continued in the era of the local authority-FSAI service contracts. In the current year, provision has been made for total Exchequer assistance to local authorities of £4.566 million. Funding will be paid in each case on the basis of certification by the FSAI that the local authority concerned has met its contractual obligations to that body.</P>

      <P>The area aid application relating to this herd number was subject to an inspection in 1998 in which an overclaim of some 28% was determined. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92 when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore in this case, as the overclaim was greater than 20%, any area aid linked payments issued in respect of 1998 must be recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amounts paid under 1998 schemes were £2,804.60 in respect of suckler cow premium, <Col N="492" /> £862.60 in respect of extensification premium and £2,133 in respect of cattle headage-beef cow. The amounts of £2,804.60 and £862.60 have been recovered from recent scheme payments but £2,133 is still outstanding and will be recovered from future payments.</P>
    <P>The bulk of this area aid overclaim was caused by the fact that the applicant who is now deceased applied for area aid in respect of a commonage parcel but failed to provide proof of his entitlement to this commonage. However in the event that the person named feels that a review of this case is now justifiable and if she provides supporting documentation, I would be prepared to have the matter re-examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage <Col N="493" /> purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped &ndash; lowland, £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped &ndash; lowland, £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; and mountain type land £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid £1,728 on 24 September 2001 in respect of 14.4 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare and including an additional sum of £1,080 under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission for farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The additional sum is equal to 90% of the difference between the average sum of the headage payments under the 1998, 1999 and 2000 headage schemes and the amount paid under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 2002 national reserve under category D. This category was reserved for farmers who apply regularly for the suckler cow premium and who require additional quota to ensure the future viability of their holdings.</P>
      <P>Category D ranked in priority after category A, first time applicants under 35 years of age; category B, farmers with holdings on offshore islands; category C, organic farmers registered with the Department. A special category, category E, for farmers in the Cooley Peninsula also held priority over category D.</P>
      <P>All the available quota of 3,048 premium rights was distributed to eligible applicants under categories A, B, C and E.  There was no quota available to make any allocations to any applicant who applied under category D.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>There will be approximately £24.6 million available from the national envelope under Agenda 2000 in 2002 for distribution among beef producers. This compares with £16.4 million available for the current year which was used to top up the slaughter premium for beef breed heifers and to top up the suckler cow premium in respect of replacement suckler cows in order to encourage a more rapid replacement of suckler cows.</P>
      <P>Consultations on the allocation of the national envelope have just been completed between my Department and various farming organisations, some of which have put forward specific proposals, including the prioritising of young farmers, for the allocation of the additional £8.2 million available for next year.</P>
      <P>I will be taking a decision on the matter within the next few weeks when an examination of the ideas put forward and the options open to me has been completed.</P>

Details of those allocations were announced last week.</P>
      <P>With regard to the permanent allocation of that seven million gallons, I am currently considering the options that are open to me and a decision will be made on this very soon.</P>
      <P>Over five million gallons were allocated in a scheme for younger dairy farmers with effect from the 2000-01 milk quota year, and in addition, a further four million gallons were allocated to younger dairy farmers in the current year.</P>

Following detailed consultations, I announced last week the rules for these partnerships. A statutory instrument giving legal effect to these rules will be signed by me in the next few days. This measure will be introduced on a pilot basis initially and will be subject to a detailed review after 12 months. The question of introducing partnership arrangements in other sectors can be examined in the light of experience gained in the operation of such schemes in the dairy sector.</P>

    <P>I expect that the revised scheme, which has been submitted to the European Commission for approval, can be fully funded within the overall allocation of 1,490.7 million for the measure in the CAP rural development plan, 2000-06.</P>
    <P>The number of overall winners under the revised scheme increases from 72,000 to 80,000, the additional 8,000 all being farmers whose holdings include mountain land. All farmers with mountain type land only will gain under the scheme now being proposed when compared to what they would receive under the scheme agreed as part of the CAP rural development plan. It is estimated that some 5,600 farmers with predominantly lowland farms but with some mountain type land will lose an average of £415 from 2004 onwards when compared to the average amount paid to them under the old animal based headage schemes in the years 1998 &ndash; 2000. A similar situation also applies outside the hill areas.</P>
    <P>Maps of mountain type grazing are stored in digital format and are not readily printable to a scale that would be useful for farmers. However, from next year pre-printed area aid applications will identify those land parcels which are designated mountain type grazing.</P>

      <P>In excess of 2,100 applications have been received in my Department under the scheme of investment aid for farm waste management. Some 300 of these applications have been rejected or returned to farmers or consultants for further information. The reasons include deficient or incomplete documentation in relation to applicant's non-farm income, lack of sufficient detail to determine planning permission requirements of proposed works and income unit declarations not corresponding to records held in my Department of livestock numbers on applicant's holdings.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to providing a quality customer service for all its customers. The protocol on direct payments to farmers, agreed under the PPF with the social partner farm organisations, launched in July 2000, reinforced this commitment to delivering a quality service and recognised the importance of the contribution of direct income payments to the financial position of farmers.</P>
      <P>The protocol, building on the progress made under the charter of rights for farmers and the customer service action plan 1998-2000, sets out a programme for further improvements in the quality of service, its delivery and the information provided for farmers as well as setting specific delivery and service targets for the wide range of direct income payments to farmers. In addition it clarifies how schemes will be administered, gives greater clarity to the inspection procedures and sets out how and when farmers will be advised of problems with applications.</P>
      <P>Among the schemes covered under the protocol are the on-farm investment schemes, including the scheme of investment aid for farm waste management. Compliance with the protocol is monitored by the protocol monitoring and review committee. Feedback is very positive and has acknowledged a significant and sustained improvement in the quality of service in recent years.</P>
      <P>All applications under the farm investment schemes are processed in accordance with standard procedures. These procedures are considered to be the minimum necessary to ensure that applicants fully comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme. The scheme documents and the application forms themselves include checklists of documents required to support a valid application. In addition, as part of the information campaign surrounding the launch of these schemes, my Department held regional information seminars for consultants and advisers, who prepare applications for farmers.</P>
      <P>To deal with individual problems which are not resolved otherwise, the Department operates a formal complaints procedure through which farmers may have complaints about the quality of service they receive resolved. Details of the complaints procedure are available at all the Department's public offices.</P>

      <P>Under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme there is a minimum stocking density level required of 0.15 livestock units equivalent per forage hectare in the calendar year preceding the year of application for compensatory allowances. This is to ensure that the land is being farmed, and to prevent problems of undergrazing and is a requirement laid down by the European Commission. The minimum stocking level will not apply where agri-environment or other recognised environmental measures require a lower stocking density. In addition, farmers who are unable to meet the minimum stocking level but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>When the common organisation of the market in agriculture, COM, was reformed in 1992, and support for farming moved largely away from market supports to direct support for farmers, the EU put in place a system to ensure a standardised approach to those direct payments in the various member states. A regulation was introduced requiring each member state to establish an integrated administration and control system, IACS, for the various area aid and animal premia.</P>
      <P>The regulation governing the integrated administration and control system &ndash; Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 &ndash; requires member states to carry out on-the-spot inspection of a minimum number of the claims; 5% for area aid and 10% for animal premium schemes. The regulation requires that on-the-spot inspections shall be unannounced and cover all the agricultural parcels and animals covered by one or more applications. Advance warning limited to the strict minimum necessary may however be given, although as a general rule, this should not exceed 48 hours. Advance notice is given of on-the-spot inspections for the cattle and area aid schemes. However, in the case of the ewe premium scheme most inspections are unannounced.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, compliance inspections under the rural environment protection scheme, early retirement scheme and installation aid are required to be unannounced. In the case of inspections relating to on-farm investment schemes, inspection times and dates are arranged with the applicant.</P>
      <P>In summary, unannounced inspections are envisaged under the regulations governing certain schemes and are an important feature of the controls required in ensuring that EU funds are not misappropriated.</P>
      <P>Under the protocol on direct income payments to farmers, which I agreed with the social partner farm organisations in July 2000, a code of practice has been established in relation to the conduct of unannounced inspections by this Department's inspectors. A safety statement has been prepared for staff carrying out on-the-spot inspections and they are advised of safe inspection procedures.</P>

      <P>The North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, has, as one of its stated objectives, the enhancement of co-operation in relation to animal health matters on both parts of the island of Ireland. Structures have been established to pursue this aim, and discussions have already taken place in relation to the development of complementary animal identification and traceability systems, in relation to the arrangements in place to prevent illegal cross-Border trade in animals, in relation to the development of programmes for dealing with various animal diseases and in a number of other areas.</P>
      <P>It has certainly been recognised in the wake of the FMD crisis that it is in the interests of the farming community on both sides of the Border to develop complementary systems which will enhance the animal health status of the island of Ireland as a whole. The structures established under the NSMC provide a mechanism for identifying possibilities for further collaboration and practical co-operation in a range of animal health areas on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>This is not to say that the establishment of a single veterinary regime is without its difficulties, and in particular, the high incidence of BSE in the UK has meant that there has been a complete ban on the exportation of cattle from Northern Ireland since 1996, and this is likely to remain in place, certainly in the short-term.</P>
      <P>However, there is already a great deal of equivalence in the veterinary regimes operated north and south of the Border. There has been a very high level of co-operation between ourselves and Northern Ireland on animal health issues, and I will continue to focus on developing this relationship both at ministerial and official level in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>Mechanical grading trials were carried out in Ireland in August 1999 and March 2000 and the results were communicated to the European Commission in March 2000. Similar trials were also carried out in Germany, Denmark and France. These trials were the subject of discussion at beef management committee meetings in March and April 2000.</P>
      <P>The consensus of opinion was that the trials in Ireland had been carried out in a highly professional manner. While the three machines involved achieved high accuracy results in relation to conformation and meat content of the carcasses, they were less accurate in relation to fatness and, in general, they failed to attain the standards set down by the European Commission in a draft regulation setting standards to be met by these machines prior to their approval for classification purposes. Following discussion in the beef management committee, the Commission agreed to carry out a pilot test to examine whether the standards and procedures set out in the draft regulation were practicable.</P>
      <P>Germany was selected as the venue for the pilot test and a trial was carried out in September this year in which my Department was involved. The results of this trial are unlikely to become available until early next year. It is hoped that the European Commission then will set down standards for the approval of automated classification systems. It will be necessary to have an authorisation trial carried out on any proposed system in Ireland to ensure that it meets the approved standard. While continued progress is being made in regard to mechanical classification, it is likely that it will take some time yet for the introduction of a system which meets strict European Commission standards. I fully support the introduction of a mechanical classification system and I will do what I can to progress the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>With the introduction in June of this year of the national sheep identification system, NSIS, Ireland has, for the first time, full traceability for all sheep on an individual animal basis. Every sheep which moves from a holding within the State or which is imported into the State and every sheep carcase processed in any of our processing plants is now fully and individually identified and full traceability is now possible. All sheep remaining on holdings are required to be individually tagged by 15 December next. I attach great importance to this development which is of significant benefit to the sheep sector, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the various requirements which it has been designed to address, I believe that the NSIS system is simple to understand and operate. It avails of opportunities offered by modern technology and is also cost efficient from the perspectives of flock owners processors, tag suppliers, the Department and purchasers of Irish sheepmeat. I accept that it does impose a measure of additional work on flock owners and others, but this will be the case with any worthwhile system of identification and traceability. I regard such extra effort as an investment in the future of the sector and in its capacity to meet the requirements of markets and ever more discerning consumers. It should also be recognised that individual identification provides the flock owner with a valuable management tool, a fact which has been publicly recognised by a number of flock owners since the NSIS became operational.</P>
      <P>My Department is monitoring the implementation of the NSIS on an ongoing basis and will address any significant difficulties should they arise. I am pleased to report that the system generally is working well and that sheep presented in marts and factories are properly tagged and documented. I look forward to full compliance by flock owners with the requirement that all sheep remaining on holdings are tagged no later than 15 December next.</P>
      <P>It is worth pointing out that from June to date more than eight million tags have been issued by approved suppliers to almost 40,000 flock owners. This represents almost all of the flock owners in the country. While I regard the introduction of the NSIS as a major achievement, it is a system which can be built upon and which can evolve and be further developed in line with technological advances and the requirements of the sector as a whole.</P>

      <Quest>the average time it takes to consider an appeal by the REP scheme appeals committee.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The average time from the lodging of an appeal to a decision on it by the REPS appeals committee is between four and five months. When an appeal is lodged, it is first investigated by my Department's inspectors and they prepare a report for the appeals committee which meets regularly to deal with a list of cases presented to it. Straightforward appeals may take considerably less time to finalise, but more complex issues, or cases where additional information or investigation is required, may take longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The REPS appeals committee has held 14 all-day meetings so far in 2001 and further meetings will be arranged as required. Some delays at the investigation stage arose earlier this year when my Department's inspectors could not visit farms because of the precautions against the spread of foot and mouth disease. While this backlog is being addressed as quickly as possible, my Department's inspectors have to deal with the inspection of appeals along with their other work, which includes the processing of new scheme <Col N="508" /> applications. Applications for REPS are being received in very large numbers at present and they must be dealt with in compliance with the targets set down in the protocol on direct payments to farmers.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 36 cows and seven heifers under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of his application it was found that one animal, tag number MZA835942, did not have a required date of last calving. My Department wrote to the person named on 25 September 2001 and again on 10 October 2001 concerning this matter. A reply was received on 16 October but on further examination the date of last calving given did not match our records, which showed no calving details registered for this animal on the cattle movement monitoring system. My Department wrote to the person named again on 17 October advising that in order to avoid any further delay in the processing of the application the details should be registered as soon as possible or to submit a letter from his veterinary surgeon with details of calving, if the cow had a calf which died at birth. A reply from the person named is awaited.</P>

A REPS II plan, prepared as all plans are, by an approved REPS planner in consultation with the person named, was submitted on 28 September 2001 and the commonage share was declared in this plan as ineligible for payment by the applicant and his planner.</P>

      <P>A condition of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. In this context a certain percentage of these applicants must be subjected to an on-farm inspection. As the person concerned was a headage recipient in 2000 and as the stocking density of the holding was 0.12 livestock units per forage hectare in 2000, he is among a number of applicants who have been selected for an on-farm inspection. If his holding meets the requirements, payment will issue as soon as possible following the on-farm inspection.</P>

      <P>Following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain, trade in sheep, pigs and other susceptible species between the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and this jurisdiction was prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general trade in live animals, including sheep, between member states of the European Union is governed by EU legislation requiring,<i> inter alia,</i> that animals must be accompanied by appropriate health certification and must be <Col N="516" /> properly identified. However, prior to the foot and mouth disease &ndash; FMD &ndash; crisis, special arrangements were in place under a bilateral agreement with the Northern authorities, which exempted trade in sheep and pigs on the island from the full rigour of normal intra-community trade requirements. Against the backdrop of FMD, it has been decided to revert for the time being to a situation in which intra-community rules will govern trade in live animals between both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>Based on this approach, trade in the importation of sheep from Northern Ireland for immediate slaughter was permitted to resume from 30 July 2001. All such sheep being imported from Northern Ireland must be individually tagged on departure from that jurisdiction and be in compliance with EU trade rules. The importation of sheep from Northern Ireland for breeding and for fattening purposes is at present under examination with a view to re-opening the trade between North and South in the near future. Sheep which may be imported for these purposes will attract the relevant import tag requirements of the national sheep identification system (NSIS) and be in compliance with the relevant EU certification regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is represented on an inter-departmental group, chaired by the Department of Finance, which is currently examining the best location in the longer-term for responsibility for legislation, which requires the services of a professional veterinarian. At present, in so far as the discharge of food safety related functions at premises slaughtering animals and processing foodstuff for the home market is concerned, each local authority is responsible to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland under service contract arrangements. The work of the inter-departmental group is ongoing and, when finalised, its conclusions will form the basis for decisions, which will be made at Government level on the longer-term future of this service following expiry of the current service contracts at the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>I am aware that views have been expressed in the context of the recent foot and mouth outbreak about the importance of local services. I have no doubt but that this perspective will be taken fully into account by the inter-departmental group when considering the longer-term future of the service.</P>
      <P>As regards funding, under relevant legislation &ndash; the Abattoirs Act, 1988 &ndash; each local authority was given responsibility to recover costs, either partially or wholly, through fees imposed on premises subject to inspection by them. However, since it became evident in late 1996 that many local authorities had to varying degrees not been fully discharging their statutory functions in this area, linked at least in part to their inability to recover the requisite costs from the industry, Exchequer assistance has, with Government approval, been paid through my Department's Vote with the objective of ensuring availability of the financial resources necessary to allow local authorities fully discharge their responsibilities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc </i>funding arrangements referred to have continued into the era of the local authority-FSAI service contracts and are still in place. In the current year, provision has been made for total Exchequer assistance to local authorities of £4.566 million. Funding will be paid in each case on the basis of certification by the FSAI that the <Col N="520" /> local authority concerned has met its contractual obligations to that body.</P>

      <P>I am answering this question on behalf of all Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the Mount Street crèche in Dublin is the only one available to civil servants. Under health board regulations, the number of places <Col N="522" /> which can be offered by a crèche is governed by the ages of the children involved. There are between 25 to 30 places available in Mount Street, depending on the age of the children.</P>
    <P>A place in the crèche costs £85 a week. This is the rate required to fund the crèche. It should be pointed out that the rate is significantly below rates for crèches of a similar high standard elsewhere in the city area.</P>
    <P>A place in the crèche costs £85 regardless of the attendance pattern of the member of staff. However, two part-time employees may agree to share a place and thus reduce their individual costs. If a place in the crèche was made available at a reduced rate to a part-time employee who did not have a partner, the crèche would not remain viable unless the fees were increased for all other parents using the crèche.</P>
    <P>As announced in budget 2001, I have allocated £10 million over two years to fund a major expansion in the provision of child care for civil servants. Departments have carried out surveys of their staff to ascertain their child care needs. In the light of these surveys, proposals are being drawn up by my Department in conjunction with the Office of Public Works for a number of crèche projects both in Dublin and around the country. Steps are also being taken to establish a central body which will advise Departments, contract with the providers of child care and generally supervise the operation of the new crèches.</P>
    <P>A new Civil Service crèche in Marlborough Street, Dublin will shortly be opening. It is expected that this crèche will provide a further 30 or so places.</P>

      <P>Save in so far as may be provided by specific enactment in each case, the legislation required to give effect to the Financial Resolutions of each year shall be enacted within that year.</P>
      <P>In the case of Financial Resolutions passed on a budget night held in December, Article 17.1.2 requires that, unless otherwise provided by law, such resolutions must be enacted into law by the end of that year, that is, by 31 December.</P>
      <P>The bringing forward of the date of budget 1998 to December 1997 raised the issue of how to comply with this requirement. The procedure adopted in the Appropriation Act, 1997, following legal advice, was to allow the enactment of the legislation required by Article 17.1.2 to be deferred to the year 1998 and this procedure has been followed in every Appropriation Act since then. This means that the resolutions are enacted as is usual in the subsequent Finance Act.</P>
      <P>As regards the usefulness of the Article in question, I understand that the constitutional review group and the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution, 1996-97, the O'Keeffe committee, has recommended some changes aimed at clarifying the meaning of the Article.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy, in asking this question, <Col N="524" /> is referring to the provision that I introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, which while reducing the capital gains tax rate from 40% to 20% for disposals of development land which had planning permission for residential development also stipulated that this 20% rate would be increased to 60% for disposals after 5 April 2002. This was the carrot and stick approach recommended in the first Bacon report in order to bring to the market land suitable for residential development.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Act, 1999, I continued this approach by extending the 20% capital gains tax rate for disposals up to 5 April 2002 of land zoned for residential development and disposals to the National Building Agency and to the voluntary housing sector. In the Finance Act, 2000, I reduced the rate of capital gains tax on the disposal of development land generally to 20%.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of these changes I believe the supply of residential land increased considerably in the last two years and there was a big increase in the number of full planning permissions granted in 2000 as compared to 1999. In other words, there was good reason to believe that the impending 60% CGT rate had served its purpose in speeding up disposals of residential development land. Furthermore, if the 60% rate of CGT were to apply from 6 April 2002 it would have meant that the rate of CGT on zoned residential land would have been three times that on zoned commercial land which could have resulted in land being diverted from residential to commercial development.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in the Finance Act, 2001, I withdrew the provision dealing with the introduction of the 60% capital gains tax rate on the disposal of residential development land which was to take effect for such disposals on or after 6 April 2002. The 20% capital gains tax rate, therefore, will continue to apply to all taxable disposals, whether of land or other assets.</P>

      <P>I have received written representations on behalf of this company, and the company was also referred to in a parliamentary question to which I replied on 9 October 2001. The position is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI, aims to use its resources as cost effectively as possible. To this end, the ECBI uses independent professional surveys of public awareness to inform the content of its public information, including advertising, campaigns, and to identify groups most at risk of low awareness of the euro. <Col N="525" /> The ECBI also uses a specialist media-buying agency in selecting the media to be used to convey its advertising messages in the most cost-effective way, both to the public generally and to low awareness groups. The board uses television, radio, press and outdoor advertising.</P>
    <P>In the press area, the ECBI was advised by its media-buying agency that it is more cost-effective to use the mass circulation of national newspapers to communicate messages on the euro to the public as a whole and low awareness groups, and so the focus of press advertising has been on the national press. The paid provincial press has been used on occasion to supplement the communication of key messages, in view of the role of such press in regional areas. As regards Dublin, not all households receive a local newspaper, so that use of the newspapers suggested by the Deputy would still have to be accompanied by national newspaper advertising, with a resultant impact on cost effectiveness; in addition, the ECBI is advised that its advertisements are already seen by an extremely high proportion of Dublin people. It is also relevant to point out that the board has received over 150 requests for print advertisements.</P>
    <P>Finally, the board provides information extensively by non-advertising means, including direct to households as well as through other mechanisms. In this context, the board has sent a leaflet to every household every year since its establishment in 1998 and has been distributing a 24 page handbook on the changeover to every household in the State during October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The current tax system has a number of personal income tax allowances and credits which are related to the care of incapacitated or disabled individuals. These are the incapacitated child allowance, the dependent relative allowance, the tax allowance for the employment of a carer, medical expenses relief, covenant relief and the home carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>The incapacitated child allowance can be claimed by a parent-guardian for a child who is permanently incapacitated. It amounts to a tax credit in a full year of £320, 408. Where more than one child is permanently incapacitated, an allowance may be claimed for each child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dependent relative allowance, now a tax credit, is granted to an individual who maintains at his or her expense, a relative of the claimant, or of the claimant's spouse, incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself, the widowed father or widowed mother of the claimant or of the claimant's spouse, whether <Col N="526" /> incapacitated or not, or a son or daughter of the claimant who resides with the claimant and on whose services the claimant, by reason of old age or infirmity, is compelled to depend.</P>
    <P>The employment of a carer allowance may be claimed for employing a carer for an incapacitated person and applies at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate for expenses up to £10,000, 12,700, per annum. Since the 1999 Finance Act, the allowance is now available to all family members who employ a carer in respect of a totally incapacitated person. This means that a number of family members can now share the cost of employing a carer and share the allowances between them subject to the overall ceiling of £10,000, 12,700, in any one year.</P>
    <P>Medical expenses relief is available for unreimbursed medical expenses and is of particular benefit to those with regular medical expenses and is available to those individuals who incur expenses of more than £100, 127, per annum or for families who incur expenses of more than £200, 254, per annum provided these expenses are not reimbursed by any other agency, health board, insurance company, etc. There is no upper limit on what can be claimed and the relief is also available at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax. A taxpayer can claim medical relief on behalf of himself-herself, his-her spouse and children and his-her dependant relatives. The scope of the relief was widened in the Finance Act, 2001, to cover the cost of educational and psychological assessments, speech and language therapy services for children and routine maternity care.</P>
    <P>Income tax relief at the marginal rate is also available for those who covenant income to certain individuals. Unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of permanently incapacitated minors other than from parents to their own minor incapacitated children. Unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of permanently incapacitated adults.</P>
    <P>The home carer's allowance of £3,000, 3,810, per annum is available to those spouses of married one income families, where one of the spouses works in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons. It may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed to tax. For the purposes of the allowance, an incapacitated person is a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity.</P>
    <P>In addition to the tax allowances-credits there are two payments made by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in respect of carers.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is a means tested payment for carers on low incomes who look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that there has been a number of improvements in the carer's allowance scheme in recent years. These include: a substantial easing of the means test such that <Col N="527" /> the first £125, 159, of weekly income in the case of a single person, or £250, 317, in the case of a couple, is now disregarded in assessing entitlement; the extension of the free schemes to recipients of the carer's allowance; and the introduction and subsequent increase of the annual respite care grant which now stands at £400, 508, with two grants payable to any carer looking after more than one person.</P>
    <P>A new carer's benefit scheme was introduced in 2000. This scheme enables employees to give up work temporarily to care full time while still retaining their employment rights. This new benefit is payable at a rate of £96.50, 123, per week for up to 15 months and, as an insurance-based scheme, eligibility is based on a person's PRSI contributions record rather than means.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce any new additional tax allowances as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Act, 2000, included provisions, subject to a commencement order, for the introduction of a special scheme of targeted relief in respect of the purchase of milk quotas under guidelines to be issued by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for the introduction of the milk quota restructuring scheme. It was subsequently considered that the commencement order should be delayed pending the result of a High Court challenge to the scheme. The judgment of the High Court was appealed to the Supreme Court with the decision of the High Court in favour of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development being upheld by the Supreme Court in a ruling on 30 March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the introduction of any new scheme of this nature, European Commission rules on state aids must be respected. When it emerged that the Commission has decided to open proceedings under Article 88(2) of the EC treaty against the Spanish authorities in respect of the operation of an interest rebate scheme for the purchase of <Col N="528" /> milk quotas, it was considered necessary to delay the signature of the commencement order until clarification on the matter was received from the Commission.</P>
    <P>I am happy to state that following the conclusion of discussions between Commission officials and officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, I signed the commencement order on Thursday, 1 November 2001. Any necessary legislative changes to backdate the order to 6 April 2000 will be included in the Finance Bill, 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there are specific rules governing the basis of assessment and the payment of preliminary tax in the commencement years of taxation under the self-assessment system, for example, in the commencement years of trading.</P>
      <P>Assessment: Year 1 &ndash; taxed on the profits from the date of commencement of trading to the end of the tax year &ndash; for 2001, the tax year ends on 31 December 2001; Year 2 &ndash; taxed on the profits of the 12 month accounting period ending in the tax year or the actual profits for the tax year, whichever is the lesser; Year 3 &ndash; taxed on the profits of a 12 month accounting period ending in the tax year.</P>
      <P>Preliminary tax is a taxpayer's estimate of his-her income tax payable for a tax year. Preliminary tax must be paid by 31 October in the tax year, so as to avoid interest charges when the final tax liability becomes known. For the tax year 2001, preliminary tax had to be paid by 31 October 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For an existing business, preliminary tax is calculated as follows: 90% of the final liability for the current year; or 100% of the final liability of the immediately previous year or 74% of the <Col N="529" /> 2000-01 liability in the 2001 &lsquo;short' tax year; or 105% of the final liability of the year preceding the immediately previous year.</P>
    <P>There is an exception in the case of a taxpayer being taxed under the self-assessment system for the first time, for example, commencing to trade.</P>
    <P>A taxpayer may have difficulty in calculating preliminary tax due in his-her first year. Interest will not be charged if the taxpayer does not pay preliminary tax in his-her first year.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case referred to by the Deputy, payment of preliminary tax for the tax year 2001 due on 31 October 2001 is optional. The commissioners recommend that he-she pay preliminary tax in the first year as near to the final tax liability as he-she can estimate.</P>
    <P>However, in the second tax year of trading, in the case in question, the tax year 2002 which will be assessed on profits earned in the first 12 months of trading ending in 2002, the taxpayer must comply with the 90% payment of the 2002 tax liability or 100% rule for 2001. Because of the &lsquo;short' tax year in 2001 this equates to 135% of the 2001 tax liability <i>viz. </i>100/74 x 100%. This will ensure that the taxpayer meets the preliminary tax obligations for 2002 and therefore avoids an interest charge when the tax bill for the tax years 2001 and 2002 are finalised.</P>
    <P>Revenue has produced two leaflets to help taxpayers starting in business and entering the self assessment tax system for the first time. They are entitled, Starting in Business &ndash; a Revenue Guide, and, A guide to Self Assessment. Copies of both leaflets have been sent to the individual referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy has put down a similar question to other Ministers and their responses will indicate NDP expenditure in the areas for which each Minister is responsible.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Finance, my Department is responsible for the direct allocation and spending of funds under the technical assistance operational programme and also the peace programme. The amount spent on each of these programmes is not currently available at county levels but at regional and national levels.</P>
      <P>In the NDP-CSF technical assistance operational programme 2000-06, the total allocation for the State as a whole in 2000 and 2001 is 4.4 million, £3.47 million, of which 0.359 million, £0.282 million, has been spent from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2001. These amounts can be broken down between the BMW and the southern and eastern regional assembly areas, with the BMW's regional assembly allocation being 1.6 million, £1.26 million, in 2000 and 2001, of which it has spent 0.16 million, £0.126 million, from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2001. The southern and eastern regional assembly area was allocated 2.8 million, £2.21 million, in 2000 and 2001 and spent 0.199 million, £0.156 million, from 1 January 2000 to 30 June 2001. Spending on technical assistance traditionally accelerates as programmes progress.</P>
      <P>My Department is also responsible for the allocation and spending of funds for the peace II operational programme. The peace II programme was only agreed with the European Commission this year, therefore no spending has occurred on this programme to date. Spending is anticipated to begin very soon now that matters have been resolved. Currently there is ongoing expenditure under the peace I programme for the 1994-99 national development plan.</P>

      <P>I am directly responsible for the superannuation schemes for established civil servants and for non-established State employees. Under these schemes, on the death of a pensioner who was a member of the relevant spouses' and children's scheme, pensions are payable to the surviving eligible spouse and eligible children. For the purposes of these schemes, a child is defined as a person under 16 years of age or a person under 22 years of age who is undergoing full-time edu<Col N="531" /> cation or training within the terms of the relevant scheme. The definition of a child also includes a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself and who when the incapacity first occurred was a child as defined above, that is, under the age of 16 or 22 years as the case may be; in such cases no age limit applies to the pension.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Superannuation Act, 1956, an established civil servant may surrender part of his or her pension to provide a pension for a nominated beneficiary. The nominated beneficiary may be the person's spouse, father, mother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, son-in-law or daughter-in-law. The allocation can be made in favour of one person only and the allocated amount is payable only if the civil servant dies after retirement on pension. Normally, the civil servant will be retiring on grounds of age and notice of allocation must be given more than six calander months before the date of retirement; a civil servant retiring on grounds of ill-health is not permitted to make an allocation of pension.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>
      <P>Nos. 320, 321 and 323 together.</P>
      <P>The Government recognised the unusual and serious nature of the extreme weather conditions of November 2000 and moved quickly to approve a humanitarian aid scheme to assist those most severely affected by flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the nature and extent of the damage caused and the lack of consolidated information, the Irish Red Cross was given the task of assessing the levels of hardship and the extent of <Col N="532" /> funding required to bring relief to the victims of hardship. The Irish Red Cross Society has considerable professional experience in dealing compassionately, impartially and effectively with the disbursement of such humanitarian funds. The final amount assessed and recommended for the scheme was £2.75 million.</P>
    <P>A special bank account was set up by the Irish Red Cross to receive and disburse the Government humanitarian aid. The Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works, were not involved in the determination of the levels of humanitarian aid to victims of flooding. Administration of the scheme was the sole responsibility of the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    <P>It was clearly indicated that humanitarian aid allocated by the Irish Government through the flood relief scheme was granted as a gesture to those affected by the flooding between 5 and 7 November 2000 and was not intended as compensation.</P>
    <P>In total, 447 applications for humanitarian aid were received and processed and a total of £2.75 million was disbursed by the Government. All applications were dealt with on a strictly confidential basis in accordance with the Red Cross fundamental principle of impartiality and its experience in disaster relief both nationally and internationally. A special task force consisting of both assessment and administrative personnel was set up within the Red Cross to operate the scheme in order to get aid to those in need as speedily as possible. Those affected by flooding could claim eligibility for humanitarian aid under the following headings: (a) death, (b) serious injury, (c) homelessness, (d) damage to home, (e) loss of income and (f) extreme hardship. The majority of the humanitarian aid was disbursed in relation to damage to home and substantial portions due to homelessness and loss of income. However, in most cases humanitarian aid was allocated with reference to a plurality of criteria.</P>
    <P>Administration of the scheme was successful in that applicants received their allocations within eight weeks of submitting applications, a timeframe which included the two holiday periods of Christmas and new year. All applicants acknowledged receipt of cheques.</P>
    <P>Applications were received from 17 counties, across all four provinces, with the majority from the southern, south-eastern and eastern regions. The largest number came from County Tipperary, largely reflecting the high number of people living in Clonmel who sought Red Cross aid. A significant number of claims were also received from the Enniscorthy area of County Wexford and the Arklow, Avoca and Aughrim areas of County Wicklow. The percentage breakdown of applications per count was as follows: Tipperary, 30.5%; Wexford, 19.2%; Dublin-Westmeath, 12.6%; Wicklow, 12.3%; Cork,</P>
    <P>9.6%; Kilkenny-Carlow, 8.3%; other, 7.5%.</P>
    <P>As the humanitarian aid scheme was administered on a strictly confidential basis between the Red Cross Society and individual applicants it <Col N="533" /> was decided not to publish the breakdown of the disbursements on a smaller geographical area than county as it was considered that to have done so could have led to identification of individual applicants. In the circumstances, I trust that the Deputy will appreciate that I am unable to supply the information requested by him in relation to specific areas within County Cork.</P>

      <P>The Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, gave the Commissioners of Public Works powers to undertake drainage schemes to alleviate localised flooding.</P>
      <P>Since the passing of the 1995 Act seven flood relief schemes have been completed at the following locations: the Mulkear river, Newport, County Tipperary; Nanny river, Duleek, County Meath; Sixmilebridge, County Clare; Gort town, Bridge Street, County Galway; Lacken (Ardrahan), County Galway; Mulkear river, Cappamore, County Limerick and Maam Valley, County Galway.</P>
      <P>In addition, four other flood relief schemes are currently at construction stage as follows: Bandon river, Dunmanway, County Cork; Suir river, Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary; Nore river, Kilkenny city and Hazelhatch, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>A number of other schemes are at various stages in the feasibility study or design process: Suir river, Clonmel; Barrow river, Carlow town; John's river, Waterford; Ennis, County Clare; Cregaclare and other locations in south Galway; Mallow and Fermoy, County Cork; Enniscorthy, County Wexford; Tolka river, counties Dublin and Meath.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is also funding schemes where the works are being carried out by the local authority: Freemount, County Cork; Drumcollogher, County Limerick; Bridgend, County Donegal; Scotch Quay, Waterford city; Kinvara, County Galway and Belhavel, County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Following the severe rainfall and consequential flooding in November 2000, additional demands for assistance have been received and the Office of Public Works is in accordance with many other local authorities about feasibility studies and schemes which the authorities wish to carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further important initiative which the Office of Public Works has currently under way is the proposed development of a flood mapping programme. The objective of this programme is to develop, and make publicly available, maps and reports accurately detailing areas of land in Ireland which have been subject to flooding. The implementation of the programme will have <Col N="534" /> wide-ranging benefits, providing relevant and important information to assist with the following areas: (a) sustainable land-use zoning for strategic development plans, including route selection for national and regional infrastructure; (b) appropriate development control, including the review of individual planning applications; (c) identification of needs for flood mitigation measures, and (d) planning and management of flood warning and response. This formidable and complex programme which will take several years to complete will include the development of an Internet-accessible GIS-database system and extensive data collection and detailed mapping.</P>

      <P>However, in the Finance Act, 1998, I provided for capital allowances in relation to nursing homes. These allowances apply in respect of capital expenditure incurred from 3 December 1997 on building new nursing homes, upgrading or extending existing homes or converting existing buildings into nursing homes. The allowance is 15% of the qualifying capital expenditure in years one to six, with 10% in year seven, subject to certain conditions.</P>

The taxpayer ceased employment with his previous employer on 11 May 2001, and commenced his current employment on 8 June 2001. The inspector of taxes has now amended the taxpayer's certificate of tax credits and this is in the process of being issued.</P>

      <P>Extensive preparations for the introduction of euro notes and coins have been under way for some years. As part of these preparations, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has been sending a 24 page handbook on the changeover to every household in the country. The changeover to the euro is within my area of responsibility and is a major event for the public. As the handbook is the key information source for the public about it, it was appropriate for me to appear in the television advertisement referred to by the Deputy. The advertisement was designed to promote awareness of the handbook and to encourage people to read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advertisement was scheduled to run in tandem with the distribution of the handbook and, <Col N="536" /> accordingly, was transmitted from 1 October to 4 November. The production cost of the advertisement was £57,875.45. The transmission costs were £103,941.76, both figures are exclusive of VAT. The total cost was £161,817.21, exclusive of VAT. The advertisement was transmitted 84 times on RTE 1, 16 times on Network 2, 80 times on TV3, 47 times on TG4, 106 times on Sky One and 70 times on Sky News. The average unit cost per transmission was £257.92 exclusive of VAT. The ECBI's specialist media buying agency estimate that 86% of all adults will have seen the advertisement at least once, 82% of ABC1 adults will have seen the advertisement at least once, 87% of C2DE adults will have seen the advertisement at least once, 84% of farmers will have seen the advertisement at least once, 79% of adults aged 15 to 34 will have seen the advertisement at least once, 90% of adults aged 35 to 64 will have seen the advertisement at least once and 94% of adults aged 65 or over will have seen the advertisement at least once.</P>

      <P>Section 34 of the Finance Act, 2001, restores tax relief for interest on borrowings to purchase, improve or repair certain rented properties converted into multiple residential units before 1 October 1964, when the 1963 planning legislation came into force. Relief under section 34 of the Finance Act, 2001, is available, subject to certain conditions, in respect of rental income from pre-1963 properties purchased on or after 5 January 2001. The relief consists of a deduction in computing the profit from the rent from the property in respect of interest on money borrowed to purchase, improve or repair the property. Returns of income, on which the relief will be claimed under self-assessment, for the first year for which the relief may be claimed, 2000-01, are not due to be filed by taxpayers until 31 January 2002. However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is only the net profit figure, after deduction of the interest, which will be recorded by them. Accordingly, Revenue statistics will not identify the number of landlords claiming under section 34.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The terms of the grant in-aid scheme for orthodontic treatment described by the Deputy had been proposed by the Northern Area Health Board &ndash; NAHB &ndash; of the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA. However, the board has received legal advice to the effect that such a grant-in-aid scheme would conflict with the statutory provisions of the Health Act, 1970. Additional funding of £495,000, 628,000, has been allocated to the Western Health Board &ndash; WHB &ndash; this year for orthodontic services of which £420,000, 533,000, was for an orthodontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the WHB has informed me that a specialist in orthodontics was recently recruited &ndash; the board envisages that he will start work this month. In addition, the board currently has two dentists in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. I am confident that these developments on aggregate will increase the number of patients in orthodontic treatment. I am informed by the chief executive officer of the WHB that at the end of the September 2001 quarter there were 1,589 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board of which 187 patients were being treated under arrangements with private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons who are ordinarily resident in Ireland but who do not qualify for a medical card automatically have category two eligibility. Persons in this category are subject to in-patient charges in a public ward in a public hospital of £26 per night to a maximum of £260 in any 12 month period.</P>
      <P>At present long-stay charges can be made under two sets of regulations. Charges can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives &ldquo;shelter and maintenance&rdquo; rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants. Charges can also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Persons with dependants are not liable for these charges.</P>
      <P>The over-riding consideration in applying long-stay charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of long-stay care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance. In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship. It is accepted that the position regarding eligibility is complex and that, in the interest of equity and transparency, it should be made more clear. The whole eligibility framework for health services generally is one of the key issues to be addressed in the new health strategy currently being prepared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of <Col N="546" /> subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment)(No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the cost of providing residential or respite care will vary from case to case, depending on the individual needs of the persons availing of the service. My Department reviews the average cost of providing these services on an annual basis using the costs associated with the previous year's actual developments as a guide. In 2001 the average cost used for additional residential and respite places was £35,000, 44,440.83, per place. In addition to the funding provided for around 70 respite places at an average cost of £35,000, 44,440.83, per place, provision was also made for a further 40 high support respite places at a cost of £50,000, 63,486.90, per place. Four places were allocated to each health board region as part of the development <Col N="551" /> of an overall response to the needs of persons with major challenging behaviour.</P>
    <P>My Department is reviewing the average costs which would be associated with any proposed developments in 2002 as part of the Estimates and budgetary process which is under way.</P>

The national physical and sensory disability database development committee was established in December 1998 by my Department to prepare detailed proposals for the development of such a national database. When complete, the database will provide a detailed picture of health service requirements in the sector over a five year period. Phase 1 implementation included the collection of data in four community care areas, including one in the Western Health Board area. As a result of the information collected, the development committee has now finalised its recommendations and these are being considered by my Department. It is hoped that the database will be rolled out at a national level over the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 370, 376 and 387 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that in relation to the provision of multidisciplinary support services for the St. Joseph's intellectual disability services, Portrane, additional funding was allocated from the 2001 development funds to enhance the level of speech and language, physiotherapy and social work services available to the services. However, St. Joseph's services are experiencing ongoing difficulties in the recruitment of allied health professionals. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally.</P>
      <P>The process of transferring 30 residents to the new facilities in Clonmethan is ongoing. The Northern Area Health Board expects to submit an application for planning shortly in respect of the new residential and day facilities on the St. Ita's campus for a further 60 persons. It was essential that an overall control plan was developed for the campus as a whole before decisions could be taken on the siting of the new facilities for the St. Joseph's services. While detailed work was ongoing in relation to the brief for the project, definitive plans and costings for the facilities could not be completed until this process had been finalised.</P>
      <P>A site has been sourced in Lusk for the development of a complex similar to Clonmethan which would accommodate a further 30 residents from the St. Joseph's services. As part of the national development plan proposals, the provision of additional accommodation for a further 30 residents on the grounds of St Brendan's Hospital is also planned. In addition, the authority has informed me that over £1 million in capital funding was invested in existing facilities in St. Joseph's intellectual disability services between 2000 and 2001 to improve infrastructure, services and facilities for residents.</P>
      <P>My Department is working closely with the authority and the Northern Area Health Board on developments for St. Joseph's services with a view to moving these developments forward as quickly as possible.</P>

Central to the report was the provision of a national suicide prevention and reduction strategy which is now in place. Additional funding for suicide prevention programmes was provided by my Department to health boards over the last two years as follows: 2000, £1.2 million, 1.524 million; 2001, £0.83 million, 1.054 million.</P>
      <P>These figures include funding of £300,000, 380,921, over the past two years to the National Suicide Research Foundation toward the establishment of a para-suicide register and a national para-suicide study.</P>
      <P>The figures do not include funding provided by other Government Departments such as the Departments of Education and Science, the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which were identified in the report of the national task force on suicide as having a role to play in suicide prevention.</P>

The regulations were made on the recommendations of the National Drugs Advisory Board and its successor, the Irish Medicines Board, and impose further restrictions on the sale of medicinal products containing paracetamol.</P>
      <P>In general, the regulations prescribe the maximum pack sizes for products when sold in pharmacies and non-pharmacies and cautionary and warning statements which must appear on all packs, prohibit the sale of paracetamol products in automatic vending machines and in non-pharmacy outlets when a second analgesic component is present, prohibit the sale of multiple packs of paracetamol in the course of a single transaction, and prohibit the sale of paracetamol products unless they are in blister packs or in other such equivalent form of packaging as may be specified in the relevant product authorisations. Exemptions are provided in the case of prescription medicines and medicines intended for export.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board gave particular consideration to the sale of medicinal products containing paracetamol in non-pharmacy outlets and recommended that, &ldquo;Emergency supplies of paracetamol as single ingredient preparations only should be available in non-pharmacy outlets with the following restrictions: The maximum pack size will be restricted to a total of 12 x 500mg tablets or the equivalent amount of paracetamol, packaged in single unit dose packs for adult use and 60ml (125mg/5ml) for liquid paediatric formulations. Only one pack should be supplied on each occasion of purchase.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also included in these regulations, on the recommendation of the board, is the requirement that certain information be provided on the labelling of the products so as to inform users of the precautions to be taken in their use. The following statements, therefore, must appear clearly on the packaging of the medicinal product or, if there is no outer packaging, on its immediate packaging: &ldquo;Contains Paracetamol,&rdquo;&ldquo;Do not take any other paracetamol-containing products,&rdquo;&ldquo;Do not exceed the stated dose,&rdquo;&ldquo;Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of overdosage, even if you feel well. Please read the enclosed leaflet carefully.&rdquo;  in cases where a package leaflet is supplied with the product and the product is intended mainly for use in adults, &ldquo;Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of overdosage, even if the child seems well. Please read the enclosed leaflet carefully.&rdquo; in cases where a package leaflet is supplied with the product and the product is intended mainly for use in children not over 12 years of age, &ldquo;Immediate medical advice should be sought in <Col N="557" /> the event of overdosage, because of the risk of irreversible liver damage.&rdquo; in cases where no package leaflet is supplied with the product.</P>

      <P>Since the publication of the report, Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures, in June 1999, the South-Eastern Health Board received additional funding from my Department of £26,000, 33,013, in 1999, £48,000, 60,947, in 2000 and £86,000, 109,197, in 2001 to recruit additional staff to carry out assessments and implement the standardised framework for inter-country adoption. The standardised framework is now being used in all boards. The purpose is to streamline assessment processes so that resources are used effectively and to provide a transparent system that can be understood by all of the parties. It has been welcomed by health boards and couples.</P>
      <P>Arising from the additional funding and the implementation of the standardised framework the waiting time for assessment in the South-Eastern Health Board has been reduced from up to two and a half years to 18 months in the last year and a half. Since 1998 the number of social work staff employed in the South-Eastern Health Board adoption service has increased from two to 5.5. I have contacted the South-Eastern Health Board in relation to this application for an assessment for inter-country adoption. The board has advised me that it received the person's application in July and expects to begin the assessment at the end of next year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, an allowance is paid in respect of children who are placed in foster care under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995, or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. The children in respect of whom these allowances are paid must be in the care of the health board, under the Child Care Act, 1991, either on a voluntary basis or by court order. Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the parents of persons with disabilities from the Ballinasloe area. As the Deputy is aware, the Government gave a commitment to a three year accelerated programme of investment, commencing in 2000, in services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In the subsequent two year period, additional revenue and capital funding amounting to £151.7 million &ndash; 192.62 million &ndash; has been made available nationally to the services.</P>
      <P>As the Estimates discussions in relation to 2002 are still under way, I am not in a position to comment on any specific plans for the health services in that year. Decisions on the precise details of the services to be provided from any additional funding and the individuals who will benefit from those services are a matter for the relevant health board, in this case the Western Health Board, in line with the priorities which have been identified for the region and any guidelines which may be issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Western Health Board that, following a regional co-ordinating committee meeting held on 28 September 2001, it was agreed to set up a subgroup to examine the current service provision with a view to drawing up a plan to meet the needs of people with intellectual disabilities in the south Roscommon and east Galway area.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being intro<Col N="561" /> duced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training in October 2001 for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics. This brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine.</P>
      <P>Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way. Through the postgraduate medical and dental board, I have also funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry. The postgraduate director will assume his duties in January 2002. His role will be to promote and ensure that co-ordinated postgraduate training in dentistry of a high standard is provided.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The Mid-Western Health Board has been allocated an additional £529,000 &ndash; 671,000 &ndash; this year for orthodontic services of which £404,000 &ndash; 513,000 &ndash; was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board proposes is to recruit additional staff and validate its orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department recently approved a proposed scheme from the Mid-Western Health Board to engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients. I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 1,408 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board.</P>
      <P>I have asked the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board to investigate the position in relation to this case and to reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Col N="564" /> Information on the number of people who attended accident and emergency departments and out-patient departments in each of the past three years as a result of road traffic accidents is not routinely collected by my Department. My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief executive officers of the health boards to compile the information requested and forward it to him directly.</P>
    <P>The information supplied indicates a significant reduction in the number of in-patients admitted following road traffic accidents between 1998 and 2000. In addition, the number of bed days taken up by patients admitted following a road traffic accident has fallen. Notwithstanding the reported reduction in the figures, the volume of admissions resulting from road traffic accidents continues to put considerable pressure on the hospital system, including accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have initiated a wide range of measures to improve our accident and emergency services. This includes the provision of a £32 million investment package aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. The investment package has been targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants to ensure patients have improved access to a prompt senior clinical decision-making service.</P>
    <P>I have also provided funding to the ERHA and the health boards to support a further range of initiatives in accident and emergency departments. These include £5.19 million towards the development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital, provision of minor injuries units in the Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St. James's and Tallaght Hospitals, development of an accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital, extension of the accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital, development of pilot services for deep venous thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital, provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital, provision of a pilot discharge lounge in Beaumont Hospital, recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel at accident and emergency sites in the eastern region, development of new accident and emergency departments at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, and the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, planning of a new accident and emergency department for Cork University Hospital, development of an accident and emergency department at Galway University Hospital, Castlebar General Hospital, Tullamore General Hospital and Portlaoise General Hospital, appointment of a design team for the development of a new accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital and upgrading of accident and emergency facilities at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda,</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994 my Department produced a health services waste policy aimed at reducing the impact on the environment of waste production in hospitals and improving conditions for those handling the waste. The policy set out basic principles relating to the generation and management of waste. They included the segregation of waste into domestic type waste and the potentially hazardous fraction known as health care risk waste. A strategy of using non-incineration, shredding and decontamination technology was pursued for the health care risk waste.</P>
      <P>Health care risk waste from virtually all publicly funded acute hospitals is now disposed of through a national contract. The contract specification covers the collection, treatment and final disposal of health care risk waste to the highest environmental and health and safety standards. The waste is processed in a shredding and disinfection plant which operates under an Environmental Protection Agency licence. The sterilised residue is disposed of to a licensed commercial landfill site under strict conditions. Guidance on the proper segregation and handling of health care waste was issued by the Department to health boards and major acute hospitals in 1999.</P>
      <P>I understand that investigations are continuing by the relevant authorities into the alleged dumping of hospital waste and it would not be possible to comment on the alleged dumping in County Wicklow until the outcome of those investigations is known. I also understand that the Eastern Regional Health Authority has written to all hospitals in its area reiterating the above guidance.</P>

    <P>My decision to make nicotine replacement therapies available to medical card holders was taken on foot of recommendations made by the cardiovascular health strategy group and the advisory forum established to support the task force in the implementation of the strategy. Having regard to the recommendations made to me I decided, as an exceptional measure, to make the full range of nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders only. Evidence shows that the lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of their disposable income on tobacco. I consider that this group is in greatest need of assistance in quitting the habit and responded accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Although children with Down's Syndrome are not at present automatically eligible for a medical card, medical cards may be awarded on the basis of individual circumstances. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a commitment was given that the health board chief executive officers would examine the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners with particular emphasis being placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take up, including information deficits. This review has been completed recently and I understand that the chief executive officers will present a report of their findings to my Department shortly. This report will be considered as part of the existing examination of the issue of eligibility that is taking place in the context of the new health strategy being prepared in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to patients in County Wicklow is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, four dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority commenced their training in October 2001 for specialist in orthodontics qualifications and discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way. Through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board, I have also funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry. The postgraduate director will assume his duties in January 2002. His role will be to promote and ensure that co-ordinated postgraduate training in dentistry of a high standard is provided.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million &ndash; 2.971 million &ndash; this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million &ndash; 2.044 million &ndash; was for the orthodontic initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me of the following developments in <Col N="569" /> relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: two additional consultant orthodontists, two specialists in orthodontics and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board &ndash; ECAHB &ndash; have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised; a competition to fill the post of dental hygienist in the ECAHB has been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidate is in train. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future; a six surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The assessment and treatment of patients there has recently commenced and, coupled with other developments in the authority, will facilitate a significant increase in the number of patients in orthodontic treatment; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards; validation of their waiting list is in progress.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the ERHA that, at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 3,288 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority. The breakdown of orthodontic waiting lists by county is not routinely collected by my Department. I have, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the ERHA to look into the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 409 together.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable, £90, £120 and £150 &ndash; 114.28, 152.37 and 190.46 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum, which are eligible for subvention.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>In relation to the particular cases mentioned by the Deputy, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to examine them as a matter of urgency and respond directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of children waiting for ophthalmology services as in-patients in the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, as at 30 June 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, was 61. Of these children, 29 were waiting three to six months for treatment and 32 were waiting over six months for treatment.</P>
      <P>There are currently two consultant ophthalmologists working in the Children's Hospital, Temple Street and there is also a locum ophthalmologist providing six sessions per week there.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to develop services at the Children's Hospital is a matter for consideration by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, in the first instance, and my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the authority to outline to the Deputy the initiatives taken to further reduce waiting lists and waiting times at this hospital.</P>
      <P>The total number of children on public hospital waiting lists in the target specialties in June 2001 was 2,857. This figure represents a decrease of 583, or 17% on the comparable figure for June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists and waiting times in target specialties for children. For example, between June 2000 and June 2001, the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months decreased by 85%, the number waiting <Col N="574" /> for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by 31%, and the number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 25%.</P>
    <P>The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no adult waits longer than 12 months and no child waits longer than six months for treatment. It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment.</P>

    <P>Patients are referred for secondary care orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department that prioritise need for treatment based on the degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion. Patients in Category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in Category B have less severe problems than Category A patients but have a need of treatment and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the chief executive officers of the health boards that at the end of the <Col N="575" /> September 2001 quarter there were 15,920 patients in orthodontic treatment.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in counties Cork and Kerry is a matter for the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The board has advised that sufferers of Alzheimer's disease who are cared for in the community have access to a range of community services, including public health nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, general practitioner services, home help services and respite care services. Provision for Alzheimer's sufferers is also specifically made in a number of the board's day care centres at present. In addition, some Alzheimer's sufferers attend day care centres on days not specifically designated for this purpose, depending on the individuals condition and the capacity of the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for additional day care centres and discussions are ongoing with the intention of providing two dementia-specific centres under the terms of the plan, at Bessboro, Cork and Kilgarvan, County Kerry. A further day care centre has been built recently at Cobh, County Cork, where it is intended to provide two <Col N="576" /> days a week service for Alzheimer's sufferers and three days a week facilities for older people.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board works closely with and supports voluntary organisations engaged in the provision of services for Alzheimer's sufferers. Voluntary organisations assisted in this regard include: Alzheimer Society which provides a day care centre in COFFA House in Cork three days a week and similar services in a day care centre in Lower Bear Forest, Mallow &ndash; in addition, it provides an outreach home support service and an information helpline; St. Luke's Home, Mahon, a specifically designed 30 bed unit offering residential care; Cork Alzheimer's Foundation, Windmill Road, Cork which offers day care and home support services; Rosemary Centre, Tralee, which provides a five day service and an information helpline. Residential care for Alzheimer's sufferers is provided in St. Stephen's Hospital, Cork, the elderly services in St.</P>
    <P>Finbarr's Hospital, Cork and St. Patrick's Hospital, Mount Alvernis Hospital, Mallow. Age care evaluation clinics are held in Tralee General Hospital where dementia patients are seen and evaluated in a multi-disciplinary setting along with the liaison sisters. Nursing home subvention is paid in respect of Alzheimer's sufferers maintained in nursing homes. A consultant psychiatrist, with a special interest in old age psychiatry, has recently been appointed to the South-Lee mental health services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 423 and 424 together.</P>
      <P>While the health board members and staff are not currently designated under the Ethics in Public Offices Act, the Second Schedule to the 1970 Health Act outlines the rules in relation to membership and meetings of health boards. Section 30 to the Second Schedule states, &ldquo;A member of the board who has: (a) any interest in any company or concern with which the board proposes to make any contact, or (b) any interest in any contract which the board proposes to make, shall disclose to the board the fact of the interest and the nature thereof, and shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the board relating to the contract, and any such disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department has circulated health boards with the Department of Finance guidelines for State bodies, which outline procedures for the disclosure of interests by members of boards or State bodies.</P>
      <P>Additionally, a consultative process is ongoing between my Department, the Department of Finance and the health board-authority chief executive officer group in relation to the designation of certain officers under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. The matter of the designation of health board members under the Act is currently under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing <Col N="578" /> homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. A solution has been found to meet the most immediate individual problems and discussions are continuing in an effort to reach agreement on a more long-term approach to the issue. However, the board has advised that as at 1 November 2001, the number on the waiting list for enhanced nursing home subvention is 251.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by the provision in the nursing home subvention regulations which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subvention to contribute towards the cost of their parent's nursing home care.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. Instructions as to how the payments should be made issued recently from my Department and funding has been made available to commence the making of these payments from 1 November 2001. I understand the Southern Health Board is continuing to examine files relating to subvention applications and a final total is not currently available. However, I am advised by the board that so far, 471 cases have been identified where payments may be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to addressing the need for an appropriate GP out-of-hours service. In that regard, I have already funded two major pilot GP out-of-hours co-operative projects in the SEHB and NEHB areas. Both those projects are well resourced ventures offering participating GPs strong back-up in terms of personnel support and facilities. The objective is to ensure proper patient care combined with offering participating GPs a structured means of organising their out of hours commitments so as to significantly reduce their actual on-call workload.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In both cases, general practitioners have been involved from the outset in promoting and establishing the co-ops. This is consistent with my overall approach to this area, that is, that all out of hours initiatives must fully involve health boards and general practitioners working together in their introduction and development. In my press release dated 24 September 2001, <Col N="584" /> welcoming the evaluation report on the two pilot projects, I mentioned that I saw the development of general practice out of hours co-operatives as one way of meeting the need for appropriate care for patients at night, weekends and on public holidays. I highlighted this as an excellent example of what can be achieved through a partnership approach between my Department, the health boards and GPs. I also drew attention to the fact that issues had been raised in the evaluation report which need to be resolved before the co-op model can be rolled out nationally. The individual 2001 allocations to each health board for out of hours development were as follows:</P>

    <P>The funding allocated fully reflects the incremental approach being pursued which was agreed with the boards in November 2000.</P>
    <P>Funding for the NEHB and SEHB relates to the current operation of their pilot projects. The funding allocated to the SHB was to enable it to be the next board to undertake a major out of hours project in 2001: this project is now under way. Funding allocated to the other boards is primarily to allow them to undertake the infrastructural work necessary prior to the introduction of a major out of hours project in their areas. In fact, the North-Western Health Board has also been able to launch an out of hours project in 2001. Significant additional funding is being sought for 2002 to further advance the roll out of out of hours co-operative projects nation-wide. My Department has left it to each individual health board to manage the out of hours concept in the way that best suits their requirements and with due regard to the stage of development the project has reached. In some cases a specific person has been recruited to manage the project while in others a person already within the board has been tasked with progressing the project.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the approach outlined above is the best way to proceed if we are to introduce a proper value for money out of hours GP service that benefits both patients and doctors in a meaningful way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. In addition, persons aged 70 and over are automatically eligible for medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not sta<Col N="586" /> tutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his\her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a commitment was given that the health board chief executive officers would examine the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners with particular emphasis being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. This review has been completed recently and I understand that the chief executive officers will present a report on their findings to my Department shortly. This report will be considered as part of the existing examination of the issue of eligibility that is taking place in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1977 the then Minister for Health established the expert medical group on whooping cough vaccination to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available in relation to it and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination.</P>
      <P>The expert group was independent in its operations and in the conclusions which it reached. In general, the procedure adopted included an interview with parents to obtain a detailed history from them and an examination of the person in respect of whom the application had been made. In addition to having a clinical examination, each person had relevant X-rays and tests. Where indicated, inquiries were made of family doctors, paediatricians and others who had a knowledge of the case.</P>
      <P>In addition to the difficulties posed by the retrospective nature of the group's work, the group indicated that it considered it impossible to prove absolutely a cause-and-effect relationship between the vaccination and the person's disability. This finding is consistent with later international research on this issue. Consequently, the group came to its conclusions on the balance of probability in individual cases and, where a doubt existed, the benefit was given to that person.</P>
      <P>There were 93 cases presented to the expert group, which found that there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage in 16 of these. Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the group gave the benefit of that doubt to that person. The person to whom the Deputy refers is one of these 16 cases.</P>
      <P>An offer of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £10,000 was made in each of the cases where the expert group had found in favour of the children, on condition that no claim would be made on the child's behalf in respect of their whooping cough vaccination. There was no acceptance of liability on the part of the State or any public authority. Such an offer was made in the case referred to by the Deputy and the offer was accepted in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert medical group reviewed all cases which came before it and it is no longer sitting. In 1992 the then Minister for Health agreed to release to the families of those examined by the expert group the file compiled by the group in the course of its assessment in their case. The files have been provided in every case where they <Col N="588" /> have been requested. It is important to emphasise that these files contain all of the papers held by the Department of Health and Children about each particular case and that no papers about their child are withheld from the families concerned. In June 1998 a copy of the file concerning the person referred to by the Deputy was released in response to a request made by the mother under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Extensive international research has been conducted over many years regarding the possible link between the pertussis component of the DTP vaccine and chronic brain damage. The consensus in the medical literature is that it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between this vaccine and the development of permanent neurological damage. In the circumstances there is no basis for re-examining this case.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the reply to a parliamentary question that still does not offer any timetable as to when a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 will be visited for an occupational therapy assessment nearly three years after she was placed on the waiting list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously informed the Deputy, the administration of the disabled person's grant is entirely a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities. The use of occupational therapy staff from the health boards to carry out assessments is entirely a matter for discussion between the health boards and the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I note from the correspondence which the Deputy received from the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the local authority, in this instance Dublin Corporation, has provided for the cost of a private occupational therapy assessment. It is, therefore, no longer necessary for the health board to carry out such an assessment.</P>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists, including occupational therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in this area to 2015, was published on 25 July last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, including an increase of over 150% in occupational therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places <Col N="589" /> with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for occupational therapy.</P>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority &ndash; HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

The 20 second advertisement was aired on RTE Radio 1, once per day from Monday, October 22 to Friday, 26 October and again from Monday, 29 October to Friday, 2 November 2001. Further transmissions will be arranged by the Asthma Society.

      <P>The statement provided by the Deputy from a national newspaper is factually inaccurate in several key areas.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to extend full eligibility under the general medical services to all persons aged 70 and over with effect from 1 July of this year in the context of budget 2001. The capitation rate of £345 &ndash; 438.06 &ndash; per annum now payable in respect of individuals benefiting from this decision is a negotiated figure which reflects the outcome of the industrial relations discussions between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>Any person aged 70 and over who previously held a medical card, or applies now on a means related basis, attracts an annual capitation fee of between £71.24 &ndash; 90.46 &ndash; and £127.90 &ndash; 162.40 &ndash; depending upon the sex of the person and his or her distance from the GP. The capitation fee only covers visits by the patient to see the GP at regular scheduled surgery times. Any consultations a medical card holder has with his or her GP outside these hours attracts an out of hours payment of between £26 &ndash; 33.01 &ndash; and £52.03 &ndash; 66.06 &ndash; per consultation &ndash; again depending on the distance of the cardholder from the GP; an additional supplementary payment £20.30 &ndash; 25.76 &ndash; is payable in the event of a GP seeing more than one patient on a single trip.</P>
      <P>In addition, allowances are granted to contract holding GPs in respect of practice nurses, practice secretaries and locums. These allowances are directly related to the size and composition of an individual GP's general medical services scheme panel. It should be pointed out that a general medical services scheme contract is issued to an individual GP and not to a practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has informed me that it employed the named doctor in a locum capacity from 17 April 2000 until 5 November 2000. He was employed at St. Luke's Psychiatric Hospital, Clonmel, until 31 July and from 14 August at St. Canice's Psychiatric Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that the temporary appointment was made following the board's advertisement of the post and in accordance with the board's recruitment procedures. These procedures include an interview process, obtaining written references and confirming the registration status of any doctor who is employed by the SouthEastern Health Board whether in a full-time or temporary capacity. During the period of his employment with the South-Eastern Health Board, the doctor in question was registered with the Medical Council and a copy of his registration was forwarded to the South-Eastern Health Board by the Medical Council on 13 April 2000, prior to his taking up duty with the South-Eastern Health Board on the 17 April, 2000.</P>
      <P>This doctor's name had effect in the Irish medical register until 29 January 2001, when it was removed following a High Court Order obtained by the Medical Council. However the doctor's name was restored to the medical register by Order of the High Court on 10 August 2001.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has further informed me that it was not aware of any allegations against this doctor prior to his employment, nor did it receive any complaints regarding him during his employment with the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> I understand, however, that the South-Eastern Health Board has established a help line. Since the establishment of the health line there have been four inquiries &ndash; two of which appear to be in the nature of complaints and these are being investigated as a matter of urgency by the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I have asked officials of my Department to examine the circumstances surrounding this matter with the relevant parties in order to determine how best to strengthen existing recruitment procedures.</P>

I have made inquiries of the board in relation to the matter raised and am informed that prior to the appointment of the permanent physiotherapist at Belmullet Community Hospital in September 2001, the physiotherapist from Swinford District Hospital travelled to Belmullet Community Hospital on two days per month and provided a very limited physiotherapy service for both in-patients and a number of out-patients. The total amount of physiotherapy time available under this arrangement was approximately eight hours per month. Due to the limitations of the service it was incumbent on the board to successfully recruit a permanent physiotherapist for Belmullet Community Hospital.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements regarding physiotherapy services in Belmullet are currently being evaluated. If it emerges from the review of the service that there is physiotherapy time available then an out-patient service will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 470, 471 and 539 together.</P>
      <P>Following the making of regulations in November 2000 providing for the liberalisation of availability of taxi licences, I arranged for the introduction of a scheme of refunds by certain local authorities in relation to licence fees charged at above the default level fixed in the Public Service Vehicle Regulations, 1995.</P>
      <P>Additional mitigating measures were included in the Finance Act, 2001, which provides for a new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances are effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date.</P>
      <P>The actual cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum in line with the new write off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery. The write off will be allowed against the trading income only of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if additionally, the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis, then the cost can be written off against both the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question.</P>
      <P>The Act also includes provisions targeted at addressing some hardship cases that had been brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance. Specifically it provides that where a licence is inherited from a deceased spouse who carried on a taxi trade, the licence holder may offset the capital expenditure incurred on the original acquisition of the licence against the rental income alone from the licence, even if there is no trading income from the licence. Where inheritance tax or probate tax was paid in respect of a taxi licence, the value used for such tax purposes may be used instead of the actual capital expenditure cost, if that value is higher. The capital allowance scheme also caters specifically for the situation where a widow or widower, who has inherited the licence from his or her spouse, lets the licence to a third party who provides the associated vehicle.</P>
      <P>The courts have already clarified on a number of occasions since 1992 that there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to any secondary market value of licences. There are no current proposals for mitigation measures beyond those provided for in the Finance Act, 2001, and in the scheme of taxi licence fee refunds by certain local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice to this position, I had requested from SIPTU at a meeting on 25 July 2001, a submission categorising cases of specific <Col N="599" /> hardship which may not be fully covered by the current mitigation measures and I understand that this submission is being prepared by SIPTU. I am also aware of representations from FAIR, Families Advocate Immediate Redress, and I have suggested to FAIR that it may wish to communicate with SIPTU officials in relation to their concerns on this matter or make a separate submission to my Department.</P>

      <P>My Department carries out extensive monitoring of the planning system. Statistics in this regard are published annually by my Department and are available in the Oireachtas Library for the years up to 1999. Summary statistics are similarly published on a quarterly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past number of years, the major priority has been to complete a comprehensive review of planning legislation. This has resulted in the enactment of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Draft regulations have been prepared by my Department and are currently being considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government to ensure the full implementation of the development control provisions of the Act. The final <Col N="600" /> stage of the review process, following the making of the regulations, will then be to put in place procedures for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the performance of local planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to ensure a high quality service.</P>
    <P>As a tool for improving standards of service in local authorities, a subgroup of county and city managers, with representatives of my Department, developed a set of 21 indicators across eight local authority service functions, including planning. The indicators issued under circular to all local authority managers on 26 May 2000, requiring local authorities to commence the measurement process and to report on their performance in their annual reports, commencing with the 2000 reports. In relation to planning, the service indicators specified were: the number of applications determined; the percentage of applications determined within eight weeks; the average time taken to determine an application; the percentages of grants, refusals and appeals; and the results of appeals, that is, the percentage which uphold and the percentage which reverse the planning authority's decision.</P>
    <P>It is intended that these service indicators will be used as a basis for the development of performance standards. Using the levels of performance on the specified service indicators over the first year, standards can then be set for delivery of improved performance over the following year.</P>
    <P>Local authority planning services are also being targeted for eGovernment initiatives; work in this regard in proceeding under the co-ordination of the Local Government Computer Services Board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 476 and 477 together.</P>
      <P>The management and maintenance of their rented dwellings, including the control of vacant dwellings, is a matter for local authorities. The most recent comprehensive figures available to my Department indicate that, at 31 December 1999, there were 2,988 local authority dwellings vacant nationwide. Information from the Mayo local authorities indicates that at end of December 2000, there were 54 local authority dwellings vacant in Mayo of which 16 were in Ballina.</P>
      <P>A substantial proportion of vacancies are in dwellings which have been detenanted by the local authority prior to the carrying out of major redevelopment, regeneration or refurbishment work. In addition, vacancies occur where dwellings require renovations/improvement to bring them up to an acceptable standard before reletting. In the case of Ballina, I understand that the majority of the vacancies are planned vacancies pending consideration of the possible transfer of a number of houses to a voluntary housing organisation.</P>

      <P>A preliminary report for Bandon sewerage scheme was submitted to my Department in 1993 but has not been approved. This scheme was included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Cork County Council, for its southern division, in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the <Col N="602" /> needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced last July. Given the level of competing demand, the limited funding available, and the fact that Cork County Council has not prioritised its list on a county wide basis, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.</P>

    <P>The 1999 assessment of the number of homeless persons was based on a much broader definition of homeless persons and includes those with no accommodation, those in hostels and in health board accommodation and those staying with friends as well as those who would be staying in temporary accommodation with family or friends until suitable accommodation becomes available.</P>
    <P>While the 1999 assessment does not give detailed information sought regarding the composition of households, the assessment does indicate that in the greater Dublin area there were 2,669 homeless households, of which 2,006 comprised of one person and 663 comprised of more than one person.</P>
    <P>The next statutory assessment of housing needs, including the number of homeless persons, will take place in March next year. Information is not available in my Department in respect of the years 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <P>A certificate of suitability is required before a small public service licence can be issued for a vehicle. The inspection for such a certificate is intended to establish that the vehicle is suitable for use as a small public service vehicle. As a consequence, it covers a range of items that are additional to those required for the normal NCT inspection and gives rise to extra training, longer test durations and additional administration costs for the national car testing service, NCTS. To take account of these, a fee of £70.00 &ndash; 88.88 &ndash; fee is payable to the NTCS in respect of the certificate of suitability. A further certificate of suitability is not required for the renewal of a small public service licence. Applications for renewal need be accompanied only by the normal NCT certificate, which costs £37.80 &ndash; 48.00.</P>

      <P>From the outset of the procurement process for the national car test, it has been envisaged that all roadworthiness testing for cars, including for hackneys and taxis, should be consolidated in one organisation. This approach was favoured because of the perceived benefits of maximising the use of the specialised expertise and equipment, involving considerable capital investment, which would be required for the purposes of the national car test.</P>
      <P>The transfer of responsibility for the testing of small public vehicles, including hackneys, from the Garda to the National Car Testing Service Limited was completed in June 2001. The transfer was implemented with the agreement of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of options available to disabled persons who may choose to vote by post or may vote in person at a polling station with or without the assistance of a companion or the presiding officer. In order to be entered on the postal voters list a disabled person must apply to the appropriate registration authority by 25 November each year. Eligibility is confined to persons living at home and unable to vote at a polling station by reason of a physical illness or a physical disability which is likely to continue for the duration of the register of electors in respect of which the application is made. The requirement to apply annually is necessary to ensure that a person continues to meet the eligibility criteria and similar arrangements apply for An Garda Síochána and occupation categories of postal voters.</P>
      <P>Electoral law also makes for a range of provisions to assist those electors with disabilities who decide to vote in person at a polling station. The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1996, provides that local authorities, in making polling schemes, shall endeavour to appoint polling places where at least one polling station is accessible to wheelchair users. The Act also requires that the returning officer shall, where practicable, provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users. The returning officer must in addition, where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. If an elector has difficulty gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that voting arrangements for disabled persons are operating satisfactorily but it is a matter which I will keep under review.</P>

      <P>I assume the question refers to housing provided by voluntary housing bodies with funding from my Department's voluntary housing rental subsidy and capital assistance schemes.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the voluntary housing schemes for the purchase of individual houses by tenants. This policy is being maintained at this stage of the development of the voluntary housing sector in Ireland because it is considered that the sale of individual housing units would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and to continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.</P>
      <P>Residents of rental subsidy houses of more than one year's duration who wish to become owner-occupiers may, on surrendering their house to the approved body, qualify for the following benefits: a special mortgage allowance of £9,000 over five years to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership scheme or a local authority housing loan without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria; improvement works in lieu scheme in respect of the dwelling they are acquiring; the low cost housing sites scheme where they are providing a new house. Full details of these options are available from local authorities.</P>

      <P>The contract for the delivery of the driver theory testing service was awarded following a tendering process conducted in accordance <Col N="614" /> with EU rules on public procurement. The open tendering procedure was used to select the successful contractor. A prior information notice advising of the upcoming tendering process was published in January 2000 in the EU Official Journal and the national press. The notice seeking tenders was published in the EU Official Journal in April 2000 and notification of the tendering process was also published in the national press at that time.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the tendering process the contract was awarded to Prometric Thomson Learning, a company based in Manchester which is part of Thomson Learning, a division of the Thomson Corporation, a major conglomerate headquartered in the United States of America. A separate company, Prometric Ireland Limited, has been established here to operate the service. Some 57 persons are employed in Ireland. The contract is for a period of seven years. Driver theory testing commenced on 11 June, 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the term of the present Government, my Department has commissioned three major reports on the housing market with a particular focus on the supply and demand for housing and the affordability of housing. The Government has responded actively to the findings of these reports in Action on House Prices, April 1998, Action on the Housing Market, March 1999, and Action on Housing, June 2000, and has implemented a wide range of measures to reduce excessive house price increases, boost housing output, remove infrastructural and planning con<Col N="615" /> straints on residential development, improve affordability for first time buyers and lower income households, and afford greater access to the housing market for first time buyers.</P>
      <P>The £6 billion provided in the national development plan for social and affordable housing was augmented by a further commitment of almost £1 billion announced in the Government's Action on Housing following a review of social and affordable housing measures which was undertaken by my Department.</P>
      <P>Specific strategies have also been put in place in relation to homelessness, with the development of the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness and the preparation by local authorities of their three year homelessness action plans. Five year traveller accommodation programmes have also been adopted by local authorities who are now in the course of implementing them.</P>
      <P>The report of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, working group on housing and accommodation, July 2001, contains specific recommendations in relation to the reduction of housing and accommodation poverty. Targets in the housing area will cover key issues such as access to housing, the needs of homeless persons and travellers, housing standards and management of social housing. These recommendations will be considered by the Government in the context of the review of NAPS. The planning and provision of housing generally will also be considerably strengthened through local authority housing strategies which have now been put in place under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to providing the necessary financial and administrative support to ensure the implementation of the range of commitments made in relation to housing and accommodation supply and affordability under Framework 2 and social and affordable housing under Framework 3 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The housing forum was set up to monitor the implementation of the housing and accommodation commitments in the PPF and to provide the social partners with an opportunity to participate in the further development by my Department of policy responses to housing issues identified in the programme. The forum has met on six occasions to date and the next meeting will be held at the end of November 2001.</P>

      <P>The examination of these three cases is close to completion taking account of the financial, planning and other considerations both as regards the towns concerned and the cumulative impact of these proposals for the county council. My Department is currently awaiting information from the relevant local authorities.

      <P>I have no current proposals to extend those provisions to the offence referred to in the question. However, section 27 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 provides that a court may impose an ancillary disqualification upon conviction for any offence, other than the offences to which section 26 relates, under both the Road Traffic Acts or any other enactment where the offence involves the use of a mechanically propelled vehicle. This means that disqualification is a possible sanction in all such cases at the discretion of the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. In the context of the realisation of the primary targets of achieving a minimum 20% reduction in the number of road fatalities and a similar reduction, at least 20%, in the number of serious injuries from road accidents, the need to increase the wearing rate of seat belts has been <Col N="620" /> identified as one of the four key priority areas in the strategy.</P>
      <P>The third progress report on the strategy shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. The level of roads deaths reduced by 12.1% between 1997 and 2000 and serious injuries decreased in the 1997-2000 period by almost 25% relative to a reduction target of 20% by end 2002. There have been major improvements in road safety performance in Ireland since the 1970s. In 1979, the year of introduction of legislation regarding the compulsory wearing of seat belts in Ireland, the number of road deaths was 614. This compares to 415 in 2000, a reduction of 32%.</P>
      <P>While wearing of seat belts does not prevent accidents, it is highly effective in eliminating fatalities and reducing serious injuries in low speed crashes. The overall effectiveness of seat belts, when worn, varies with vehicle speed, seating position and factors relating to the occupant such as age, size and general fitness, but can be reasonably estimated to offer a reduction of not less than 40% in road fatalities and serious injuries assuming the wearing of seat belts by all car users. Current wearing rates in Ireland, at an estimated 55%, may save as many as 40 lives each year. The Government strategy sets a target of 85% wearing rates for front and rear seat belts which, when achieved, could result in saving an additional 30 lives each year.</P>
      <P>Measures in support of this target include the extension of the on-the-spot fines for failure to wear a seat belt and the operation of a penalty point system. At the end of 2000, approximately 84,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. More than 48,000 on-the-spot fines for non-seat belt wearing were issued to end of September 2001.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the number of road deaths in the past 30 years has not focused exclusively on car occupants. The number of pedestrians killed on the roads has been decreasing in recent years with figures for 2000 showing the lowest number of pedestrians killed in over 40 years. Pedestrian fatalities in 2000 comprised 20% of all fatalities compared with 41% in 1970. The number of pedal cyclists killed in 2000 was also the lowest number of fatalities reported in over 40 years, comprising just 2.4% of all fatalities compared to 8% a decade ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent EU directive on mandatory seat belts was adopted unanimously by the Council of Ministers in 1991 after considerable research and incontrovertible evidence that the wearing of seat belts reduces the likelihood of death or serious injury in the event of an accident and makes a substantial contribution to road safety in overall terms. The primary focus of the Road Traffic Bill, 2001 is to promote new legislative provisions that will further enhance road safety. Given the priority accorded to the wearing of seat belts in the Government strategy on road <Col N="621" /> safety, the Bill provides that a number of offences resulting from the laws pertaining to seat belts will attract penalty points.</P>

      <P>In so far as my Department and bodies under the aegis of my Department are concerned, there are a number of schemes and ways whereby assistance may be made available for community type facilities.</P>
      <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational facilities, amenity areas, including community and child care facilities, specifically in local authority housing schemes, is a matter for individual local authorities in the first instance. However, facilities of this kind, related to the size and nature of individual schemes, are funded as part of the overall cost of a housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations. The social housing design guidelines issued by my Department contain guidance for local authorities in this regard. In addition, the provision of £5 million by my Department in 2001 to enable local authorities to meet the capital costs of establishing child care facilities in local authority and other social housing estates may provide suitable opportunities to link the provision of such facilities with the provision of other community facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the regional operational programmes, 2000-2006, funding will be provided by my Department to local authorities to implement a wide range of urban and village renewal projects, including, where appropriate, the provision of community facilities. Under the Peace II Operational Programme 2000-2004, funding will be made available by my Department to county council led task forces in the six Border counties for locally based regeneration, including, where appropriate, assistance towards the provision of community facilities. No funding has been provided by my Department for communal facilities under these schemes in 2001.</P>
      <P>Under my Department's voluntary housing schemes, a grant of £4,500 per unit of accommodation being provided in a project is generally payable towards the cost of the provision of communal facilities in the project.</P>

      <P>The question of the application of the standard referred to pending its full adoption by the EU is the subject of correspondence with the European Union. Pending the outcome of this process, in July 2001 the NRA published a revised design standard for road safety barriers for its specification for road works document. The new design standard and specification implements the performance requirements of parts 1 and 2 of IS EN 1317 and will be used for all schemes for the construction and-or improvement of national roads.</P>
      <P>The new design standard and specification have been prepared to facilitate transitional arrangements as permitted in accordance with EC guidance paper J, &ldquo;Transitional Arrangements under the Construction Products Directive&rdquo;. These transitional arrangements permit products conforming to existing national systems to be used as well as those conforming to IS EN 1317 during the period of co-existence. While the new design standard applies to new works only, the question of retro fitting median barriers to existing motorway-dual carriageway roads is being examined.</P>

      <P>I have noted the annual review of the Dublin Simon Community, which outlines its programme of work with homeless persons in the Dublin area and highlights a number of proposals for desirable service improvement.</P>
      <P>With regard to local authority targets on homelessness, local authorities, together with health boards and voluntary bodies, were asked, as part of the Government's homeless strategy, to prepare local action plans to tackle homelessness. The plans for the main urban areas have now been completed and plans for other areas are due to be completed shortly. This process will ensure a more systematic identification of targets and supporting measures designed to address homelessness.</P>
      <P>The homeless action plan for Dublin, which was prepared earlier this year by the homeless agency, sets out a comprehensive range of measures to tackle homelessness in Dublin. It includes measures to prevent homelessness, to improve access to advice, information and referral services, to reduce street homelessness by two thirds, to improve emergency accommodation through the provision of additional hostel and refuge places, to improve settlement and outreach services to enable people move out of homelessness and to provide additional transitional and long-term housing accommodation. The plan also aims to improve access to mental health, counselling and support services, improve social welfare and community welfare services for homeless people, develop access to education, training and job opportunities and to research the causes of and solutions to homelessness in order to continually improve services.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Simon Community, along with other voluntary bodies, participated in the preparation of the plan. The homeless agency has responsibility for the implementation of the plan, is currently overseeing the roll-out and delivery of the measures in plan and is co-ordinating the delivery of services to homeless persons by both statutory and voluntary bodies.</P>

      <P>The building regulations do not place a restriction on the use of any particular method of construction or product, including hollow concrete blocks, provided the performance requirements of the regulations are met, for example, in relation to thermal performance and structural stability. It is a matter for building owners, designers and builders to ensure that their buildings comply with the regulations and to select the form of construction and product which best meets their needs in achieving this.</P>
      <P>Technical guidance document L, which accompanies the regulations, provides guidance on the thermal performance standards of various elements in buildings, including roofs, walls and so on.

      <P>In November 2000, I published my initial proposals for revised thermal performance and insulation requirements for new dwellings. I commenced the public consultation process of the revised technical guidance document L on 27 September 2001. All interested parties have an opportunity to comment during the consultation process which ends on 30 November 2001. I will give full consideration to all submissions received, in consultation with the building regulations advisory body before the regulations are signed and the definitive technical guidance document published.</P>

      <P>Ireland was one of the signatories to the UNEP Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, POPs, in Stockholm on 23 May 2001, and will work towards ratification of the convention in the context, <i>inter alia</i>, of the development by the EPA of national POPs emissions inventories and progress on the ratification of the 1998 UNECE, Aarhus, POPs protocol and of the convention by the European Union. The convention enters into force following ratification by 50 countries.</P>
      <P>Those POPs which are, or were, manufactured for use as, for example, pesticides are banned for such use in Ireland under EU law. In the case of PCBs, primarily in use in electrical equipment, the Waste Management (Hazardous Waste) Regulations, 1998 require the provision of certain information to the EPA in respect of all such equipment and the ultimate safe disposal of PCBs as hazardous waste. The EPA's integrated pollution control and waste licensing systems already address any use of POPs for industrial processes and any relevant emissions from incineration and other relevant sources in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Stockholm convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997, I introduced a voluntary heat energy rating method as <Col N="629" /> one of three methods of demonstrating compliance with Part L of the building regulations, conservation of fuel and energy. The Irish Energy Centre, in partnership with the energy research group UCD, developed software, which is available free of charge, to facilitate the use of this method by designers and builders.</P>
      <P>I have recently published consultation documents proposing to radically increase the thermal performance and insulation standards for all new dwellings commencing on or after 1 July 2002. Given the much improved energy performance standards proposed for all new dwellings, there would be little advantage to be gained from introducing mandatory energy certification in parallel with these requirements. My Department will, however, ask the Irish Energy Centre to upgrade the software for the voluntary heat energy rating method to reflect the proposed higher thermal performance standards. The real value of energy certification is in the context of the existing dwelling stock. Given the age distribution of the stock, there is considerable variation in energy performance between older dwellings which were built without specific energy conservation measures and those which have been upgraded by their owners. Accordingly, energy certification could provide valuable information to potential purchasers of older houses. For this reason, the national climate change strategy, which I published in November 2000, includes a proposal that vendors of existing dwellings built prior to the coming into operation of the building regulations on I June 1992 should be required to provide an energy rating certificate. It is envisaged that contractors providing services for the purchases of this system would be supervised by the Irish Energy Centre.</P>

The equivalent figures for samples of flue gas treatment residues, such as fly ash, ranged from 135 to 35,566 ng I-TEQ/kg dry matter. As a result of the significant disparity in the level of pollutants in fly and bottom ashes, the former is classified in the EU as a hazardous waste, while the latter is classified as non-hazardous.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year my Department sought, by way of a questionnaire to local authorities, specific information on the number of local authority rented dwellings which have full, partial or no central heating. Information has at this stage been received from most local authorities. However, further clarification of certain data is being pursued with the local authorities concerned with a view to definitive completion of the survey.</P>
      <P>In 1994, local authorities were advised by my Department that full central heating should be provided in all new local authority dwellings. It is established practice with regard to older existing rented housing stock that the management, maintenance and improvement of such dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of the local authority. For this purpose, authorities may use the full proceeds of their rental income and miscellaneous housing receipts, supplemented, as necessary, from their general revenue resources. The most recent statistics available from local authorities indicate that they spent some £146 million &ndash; 185 million &ndash; on the management and maintenance of their rented stock in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While responsibility for management and maintenance rests with the local authority, my Department provides 100% capital funding to authorities under the remedial works scheme to assist them to carry out major works to designated housing estates, mainly pre-1960 and rundown urban estates. The installation of central heating may form part of the works undertaken in such cases. In addition to the funding available under the remedial works scheme, local authorities may seek my Department's approval for the use of their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of their local authority housing programme and remedial works scheme, for improvement works such as the pro<Col N="632" /> vision of central heating to their dwellings. A number of local authorities have used and continue to use this approach to install central heating in their rented dwellings.</P>

      <P>Detailed information is not available in my Department on the land holdings of each local authority for the provision of local authority and affordable housing. My Department is satisfied, however, that local authorities generally have adequate land holdings in their ownership to meet the requirements under the four year multi-<Col N="635" /> annual local authority housing programme and for the provision of affordable housing. This is underpinned by the fact that this year, up to the end of September, the housing finance agency has advanced loan finance amounting to over £100 million to local authorities to finance land acquisition requirements. My Department will continue to approve the raising of loans for necessary land acquisition by local authorities as required.</P>
      <P>It is the case that in some instances, local authorities have encountered difficulties in acquiring lands that are suitable and serviced for housing development. In some of these instances local authorities have been able to purchase turnkey housing projects from private developers to overcome these land acquisition difficulties. Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, for the first time, obliges local authorities to ensure that sufficient land is zoned to meet housing needs for the period of their development plan. In their housing strategies, authorities must set out the housing needs for the area, including social and affordable housing, and how these needs will be met.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 548 and 569 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on the level of activity by local authorities under the affordable housing scheme is published in my Department's housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. However, information is not available to my Department on the number of applications made to local authorities under the scheme. While activity under the scheme has been slower than anticipated, I am confident that increases in income limits for both scheme eligibility and mortgage subsidy together with an increase in the amounts of mortgage subsidy and the introduction of a site subsidy in June 2000 have made the scheme more attractive to prospective applicants. The number of dwellings in progress by local authorities under the scheme at the end of June 2001 was 667 compared to 381 at the end of December 2000 while proposals by <Col N="636" /> authorities for dwellings under the scheme had increased by over 70% in the same period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes, on the basis of fair compensation to landowners, has operated widely in Ireland for many years and is supported by the Constitution and a range of legislative proposals which have been regularly upheld by the courts. It is a basic principle within this process that landowners must get fair compensation and that it should be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Compensation is comprised of a number of elements. The fundamental point of reference is the market value of the land at the time notice to treat is served. Provision is also made for disturbance, severance and injurious affection; these in certain circumstances would exceed the land value element of the total compensation package. Where a dispute arises about compensation the matter is referable to an independent arbitrator.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, provided for the transfer of the Minister's functions to An Bórd Pleanála and brings about other changes designed to streamline the compulsory purchase order process. These include provision for less formal oral hearings in place of the more formal public local inquiries, the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders by local authorities themselves where there are no objections, time limits on submitting compulsory purchase orders to the board for confirmation, an 18 week objective for making decisions on compulsory purchase orders and shortening the period within which local authorities must serve notice to treat to purchase the land from three years to 18 months. I am satisfied that these changes will result in a more effective CPO system.</P>

      <P>The total number of local authority houses started and completed, including acquisitions, for the years between 1996 and 2000 is published in my Department's annual housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Prior to the introduction of the four year multi-annual housing programme, 2000-03, local authorities were given a one year allocation of starts with no indication of what they could start in the following year. They could, however, generally carry forward uncommenced authorised starts from one year to the next. The principal reason for the introduction of a four year multi-annual approach, which replaced the annual allocation of starts, was to allow local authorities more scope to plan their housing programmes in order to meet increased needs. Local authorities have been strongly encouraged to front load their housing programmes as much as possible and have been given the greatest degree of flexibility in ordering their programmes. Progress to date in the delivery of the four year programme of starts is satisfactory and 12,000 starts are expected to be mobilised during the two year period, 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <P>The statutory assessment of housing needs, undertaken by local authorities every three years, provides comprehensive information in relation to the composition of social housing need. Following the results of the 1993 assessment of housing needs, my Department commissioned the ESRI to carry out further analysis of the results, <i>inter alia,</i> so as to inform the methodology and approach to future needs assessments. The recommendations of the report were taken into account in the guidelines which issued to local authorities on the carrying out of the 1996 assessment of housing needs.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are required to undertake these assessments of housing needs in accordance with section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988. This requires local authorities to have regard to the need for housing for persons who are homeless, are Travellers, are living in accommodation that is unfit for human habitation or is materially unsuitable, are living in overcrowded accommodation, are sharing accommodation where there is a requirement for separate accommodation, are young persons leaving institutional care or without family income, are in need of accommodation for medical or compassionate grounds, are elderly, are disabled or handicapped or are unable to afford the accommodation which they are occupying. The next comprehensive assessment of housing needs is due to be undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 2002 in accordance with detailed guidelines to be issued by my Department by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The 2000 non-national road grant allocations included provision for the first time of funding to enable low cost safety improvement works on non-national roads to be carried out by local authorities. This is an extension of a similar scheme which is in operation on national roads in conjunction with the National Roads Authority. In 2000 expenditure of £525,000 &ndash; 666,612 &ndash; enabled low cost safety improvement works to be <Col N="640" /> carried out at 54 locations on non-national roads. I allocated £1,719,000 &ndash; 2,182,680 &ndash; under this grant category in 2001 and it is expected that by the end of this year improvements will be carried out at a further 147 locations. My Department sought applications under this category for 2002 from local authorities on 3 October 2001. The deadline for the receipt of applications is 23 November 2001. Allocations to local authorities under this and all other non-national road grant categories for 2002 will be announced early in 2002.</P>

      <P>Arising from the severe flooding experienced in some parts of the country in early November 2000, I advised the Dáil that I would convene the interdepartmental committee on peacetime emergencies to review the response of the relevant organisations and to identify any improvements which might be made for the future. The IDC was convened in early December and set up a working group, comprised of representatives of the emergency services and public utilities, to undertake the review. The review was undertaken using an emergency management framework, dealing with mitigation; emergency planning and preparation; response and recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report of this review was prepared, approved by the IDC and circulated to local authorities, with my approval, on 12 April 2001. The report outlines the action taken by public organisations in respect of the flooding and makes recommendations for changes or improvements to existing arrangements, to enhance the response by emergency services to flood events. Local authorities <Col N="641" /> were asked to carefully examine a number of the recommendations that came within their remit and to put in place arrangements for their ongoing implementation, as soon as possible. They were also asked to examine other recommendations in the report and assist in their implementation, where possible.</P>
    <P>I understand from Kildare County Council that they have commissioned reports on flood alleviation measures in respect of a number of areas, including Maynooth, Kill-Johnstown, Celbridge, Straffan and Clane. The Maynooth and Kill-Johnstown reports have been completed and the council has been in communication with the Office of Public Works regarding funding for flood alleviation schemes in these areas. When the reports commissioned for the other three locations have been completed and examined, the council will determine appropriate follow up action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan provides for a threefold increase in capital spending on water and sewerage services in the seven years up to 2006 by comparison to the period covered by the previous NDP. Total planned investment amounts to almost £3 billion&ndash;3.8 billion&ndash;at 1999 prices, of which over £2.4 billion&ndash;3 billion&ndash;is for major public schemes. The focus of the expenditure is on providing water and waste water services to support economic and social development, employment generation, maintenance of high growth rates and the achievement of high environmental standards, including compliance with EU drinking water and urban wastewater treatment directives.</P>
      <P>The first phase of a rolling three year water services investment programme under the NDP, covering the period 2000-02, has been announced, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The programme contains details of 529 schemes which are various stages of planning or construction. The programme will be advanced progressively up to the end of the NDP.</P>
      <P>Significant progress is being made in the implementation of the programme. Major schemes which have already been completed since the beginning of 2000 include a water and sewerage scheme in Leixlip, sewerage schemes in Navan, Osberstown, Drogheda and Dundalk, the Dublin water conservation scheme and the Ballyjamesduff regional water scheme. Among the significant schemes under construction are the Dublin Bay project, which includes, at Ringsend, the largest wastewater treatment plant being constructed in the EU at present, sewerage schemes in Galway, Cork, Limerick, Wexford, Swords and Letterkenny and water supply schemes in Lough Mask, Tuam and Newmarket-on-Fergus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exchequer spending on water and sewerage services during the first year of the NDP amounted to £335 million&ndash;425 million&ndash;an increase of 16% on the 1999 expenditure, which in turn represented an increase of 50% over the 1998 figure. The Government is committed to the implementation of the NDP, particularly the infrastructure programme, which is crucial to the future competitiveness of the economy and, thus, to Ireland's continued economic and social progress. I fully accept that tackling Ireland's infrastructural deficit is a key factor in promoting national competitiveness and sustainable economic growth over the medium term. For this <Col N="643" /> reason the NDP infrastructural investment programme will remain a top Government priority.</P>

      <P>The NDP provides for a total investment of £4.7 billion, in 1999 prices, in national road improvement and maintenance between 2000 and 2006, a threefold increase on expenditure between 1994 and 1999. The NDP sets out a strategic framework for the development of the national roads network over the coming seven years. It is a matter for the NRA, within the NDP framework, to promote detailed programming of the work required and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
      <P>Good progress is being maintained with the development of the national roads network as mandated in the NDP, including on five key inter-urban routes. A number of important projects have been completed this year, including the M1 between Dunleer and Dundalk, the M50 southern cross route, the Croom bypass, N20, the Kilmacthomas bypass, N25, and the Blackpool bypass, N20. Further projects are expected to open to traffic in 2001, including phase one of the N17 Claremorris development and the project in Ballycarthy, N21.</P>
      <P>Some difficulties are being experienced in the roll-out of the roads programme, particularly in relation to land acquisition issues. I am anxious that difficulties associated with these issues should be overcome in the shortest possible timescale in order to facilitate achievement of the ambitious road improvement targets set out in the NDP. To this end, high level talks are continuing between representatives of my Department and the farming community.</P>

      <P>Under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, road authorities are empowered, in the interest of the safety and convenience of road users, to provide traffic calming measures on public roads in their charge, subject to the consent of the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads. It is a matter for each individual road authority to decide on the nature and extent of traffic calming measure to be provided at particular locations within its functional area based on specific circumstances. In addition, the Dublin Transportation Office provides grants to local authorities in the greater Dublin area in respect of a range of traffic management measures, including traffic calming arrangements and environmental traffic cells.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides in section 10 that each planning authority's development plan shall include objectives for, <i>inter alia</i>, the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population and the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities, including recreational amenities. This framework appears adequate to support a variety of approaches, including innovative approaches, to traffic management in restricted areas.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 574 to 577, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The SWA <Col N="646" /> scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. In order to qualify for a rent supplement, a person must firstly satisfy a means test. A health board must also satisfy itself that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need, that the property being rented is suitable to those needs and that a bona fide tenancy exists between the applicant and their landlord.</P>
    <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, such as single persons, couples or lone parents with one child, as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area. These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement. Health boards must be satisfied that accommodation is generally available within the limits set. If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, health boards have discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set if there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not a requirement that the landlord is registered with the relevant local authority. To introduce such a requirement would inevitably lead to a restriction in choice of accommodation for applicants for SWA as only a minority of rented property is registered with local authorities. It would also lead to difficulties for tenants who have been living in unregistered accommodation for some time before the need to claim rent supplement arose. With regard to housing standards, my Department does not examine the properties being rented by tenants who receive rent supplement payments. Responsibility for enforcing both the housing standards and housing registration regulations rests with the local authorities. However, a health board may consider that a property is not suited to the applicant's needs if the accommodation does not comply with the Housing Regulations (Standards for Rented Housing), 1993.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance which will also be operated by the local authorities. This will increase the level of contact that local authorities have with the private rented sector and place them in a better position to enforce both the standards and registration regulations. It <Col N="647" /> should lead to increased value for money in this area. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly.</P>
    <P>Health boards provide assistance with rent deposits to enable people to secure private rented accommodation. So far this year over 6,600 people have been assisted in this way at a cost of over £2 million&ndash;2.54 million. Finally, the entire SWA scheme is being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The health boards are represented on the working group that is undertaking this task. All aspects of the scheme, including rent supplements will be examined to consider whether the scheme is providing value for money.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 &ndash; 6.35 &ndash; per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional £3 &ndash; 3.81 &ndash; per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to £8 &ndash; 10.16 &ndash; per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the £3 &ndash; 3.81 &ndash; per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable. As a result of last year's budget, I announced that the fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The fuel season was extended by two weeks in April and now also commences one week earlier in October.</P>

Based on the current number of recipients and the current length of the fuel season each £1 &ndash; 1.27 &ndash; increase in the current basic £5 &ndash; 6.35 &ndash; payment rate would involve additional expenditure of £8.06 million &ndash; 10.23 million. Doubling the basic payment rate to £10 &ndash; 12.70, for the 29 week fuel season would cost <Col N="648" /> £40.31 million &ndash; 51.17 million. It is estimated that it would cost an additional £40.12 million &ndash; 50.94 million &ndash; to extend the fuel season to run for 52 weeks of the year at the current payment rates. Doubling the basic payment rate and making the higher rate payable for all 52 weeks of the year would cost £112.40 million &ndash; 142.72 million.</P>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    <P>In that regard, the increases in primary payments that I introduced in the three budgets since the scheme was reviewed have provided for a substantial real increase after fully compensating for inflation, including fuel price inflation. The increases in primary payments of £8 &ndash; 10.16, to £10 &ndash; 12.70 &ndash; per week that I brought into effect in April of this year are the largest ever implemented. Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs. Any further changes in the scheme would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre. Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment.</P>
    <P>Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. These facilities are considered to be a more appropriate mechanism for meeting heating needs outside the fuel season.</P>

      <P>A bilateral agreement with Australia was signed on 8 April 1991 and came into effect under Irish legislation on 1 April 1992. The agreement provides for the aggregation of Irish and Australian records for the purposes of the following Irish benefits: old age contributory pension; retirement pension; widow's and widower's contributory pension; orphan's contributory allowance; invalidity pension and bereavement grant. Periods of residence in Australia which are reckonable for the purposes of Australian pension entitlement may be counted as periods of contribution under Irish legislation where this is necessary to create an entitlement to benefit for a person who has also been insured under Irish legislation.   </P>
      <P>The claim for the relevant benefit or pension should be sent to the appropriate office of my Department if the person is residing in Ireland, or to the appropriate office of the Australian Department of Family and Community Services if resident in Australia. The two Departments will communicate with each other to ensure that entitlements under both systems are fully examined. Where a person does not have sufficient Irish contributions to qualify for benefit or pension under Irish legislation, qualifying periods of residence in Australia are treated as periods of contribution under Irish legislation and a proportion of the resulting entitlement is awarded according to the proportion the Irish contributions bear to the combined total. This is referred to as a <i>pro-rata</i> pension. <i>Pro-rata</i> pensions require a minimum of one paid and 52 reckonable, that is, paid or credited, contributions under Irish legislation.</P>
      <P>Where a person is entitled to benefit or pension under either scheme without having to include the period of residence or insurance in the other country, that entitlement is paid in full. This could result in a person having a stand-alone entitlement under both legislation, a <i>pro-rata</i> entitlement under both legislation, or a stand-alone entitlement under one and a <i>pro-rata</i> entitlement under the other.</P>
      <P>Further details with information on how to apply for a relevant benefit or pension are contained in Leaflet SW 87, which may be obtained from any office of my Department or on the Department's website at www.welfare.ie and I am arranging for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance, introduced in 1993, is designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active work-force, either through employment or self-employment. The scheme has been highly successful since its introduction and to date almost 80,000 people have participated. There are over 33,800 current participants in the scheme, approximately half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self employment options.</P>
      <P>Applications for participation in the scheme are completed jointly by the person and the prospective employer. The involvement of the employer is necessary in that there are conditions to be fulfilled relating to the nature of the employment involved. The scheme is, in effect, a partnership between the eligible employee, the approved employer and my Department. The co-operation of all parties, including employers, is essential to the success of the scheme and its growth has been due, in no small measure, to the high regard in which employers in general hold the scheme.</P>
      <P>Employers may choose not to participate in the scheme but, in practice, this is an unusual occurrence. The voluntary nature of the scheme has contributed to its success to date and it would be impracticable and undesirable to introduce any element of compulsion into the administration of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of social welfare legislation, the social insurance status of spouses engaged in a family business varies according to individual circumstances. Spouses who are engaged in a business partnership are treated as individual self employed contributors. Both spouses make social insurance contributions and will be eligible, in due course, to qualify individually and in their own right for social insurance pensions, including old age contributory pension. While there are specific requirements in company law regarding business partnerships, there is no restriction on married couples, <i>per se</i>, carrying on a commercial venture as a business partnership. Alternatively, where a family business is incorporated as a limited company, spouses who are engaged in the business pay PRSI either as employees of the company or as self-employed persons, if they are the proprietary directors of that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the legislation also provides that a person who is employed directly by his-her <Col N="651" /> spouse is not covered by social insurance. Social insurance contributions are not payable and the employed spouse is not covered in his or her own right for social insurance pensions. Likewise, if a spouse participates in the business of a self-employed contributor, but is not a partner in the business, social insurance contributions are not payable and the participating or assisting spouse is not covered for social insurance pensions or benefits.</P>
    <P>Any person who wishes to seek a formal decision as to whether an employment or self-employment is insurable for social insurance purposes should apply to Scope section of my Department. Where a person is dissatisfied with the relevant decision there is a right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>As regards contributions, a number of arrangements are already in place which cater for the position of persons who are no longer compulsorily covered by social insurance. Former contributors can opt, subject to certain conditions, to make voluntary contributions. In general, voluntary contributions give cover for the pensions which people were covered for when last working as an employee or a self-employed person and thereby enable such persons to maintain social insurance cover.</P>
    <P>During the course of the coming year it is proposed to examine the current arrangements applying to the social insurance position of spouses engaged in a family business and consideration will be given to any appropriate changes highlighted by this examination. I will bring forward appropriate legislative changes in due course.</P>

      <P>There is a statutory obligation on claimants for one parent family payment to make, and continue to make, appropriate efforts in their particular circumstances to obtain maintenance in respect of themselves and/or their children from their former spouse or partner. This obligation reflects the underlying principle that, in so far as possible, one parent families should be maintained by their former spouses or partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned applied for one parent family payment in June 2001. She was requested by the Department to seek maintenance from her spouse by contacting her local District Court clerk. She refused to do so in the light of a separation agreement which she had <Col N="652" /> drawn up with her spouse. The deciding officer considered that the relevant statutory condition was not, therefore, satisfied in her case and he refused her claim on that basis. The person concerned has appealed the decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to make the practice of abatement or clawback of the State pension or equivalent at the State pension age of 66, illegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the practice of &ldquo;integration&rdquo; whereby occupational pension schemes take the State old age contributory-retirement pension into account in designing the overall benefit promise being made by the scheme. I should point out that by operating integration, an employer may be able to provide a retired person with an earnings-related pension which might otherwise not be possible.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I would stress that in considering any issue relating to occupational pension schemes, one has to take into account that such schemes are voluntary arrangements between an employer and employees. However, where such occupational schemes exist, I consider they should operate on a sound basis from the perspective of the pensioner and I have made it quite clear since I became Minister that I expect the significant increases in the old age pension which have been introduced by this Government to be passed on in full to pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have expressed concern on a number of occasions in the House regarding the less favourable aspects of integration. Accordingly, in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, I provided for a prohibition on the practice of reducing occupational pensions already in payment, as a result of <Col N="654" /> increases in the social welfare pension. The effect of this measure is to prohibit occupational pensions in payment from being reduced in any one year from the level obtaining in the preceding year. Such a prohibition was recommended by the Pensions Board in its report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative &ndash; NPPI.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, while there is little, if any, evidence that any pension scheme rules permit an actual reduction in the amount of occupational pension in payment as a result of increases in the social welfare pension, this provision will act as a preventive measure to ensure that such a rule is not, in future, introduced in a pensions scheme. While integration is generally carried out on a once-off basis at the point of retirement, in a very small number of pension schemes integration continued on an ongoing basis after retirement under a total pension income approach, which was provided for in the rules of these schemes. Therefore, I brought forward an amendment in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to prohibit this practice.</P>
    <P>These measures clearly signal my concerns on this issue and ensure that social welfare increases are passed on in full. Another way of ensuring greater consistency across pension schemes in this area would be through indexation of pensions in payment and I set out proposals in this area in the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which is currently before the Seanad. The Bill proposes for schemes that do not provide indexation that there be a mandatory review by the trustees of the scheme of the possibility of indexing pensions in payment at the lower of the increase in consumer prices &ndash; CPI &ndash; or 4%. The outcome of this review and the employers response, where required by the rules of the scheme, must be published in the annual report.</P>

      <P>Selection for clerical officer posts in the Department's provincial offices, including Sligo, which fall to be filled by transfer of serving civil servants is made by reference to the order of the Department's transfer list for the location concerned. The procedures which govern the filling of clerical officer posts in provincial locations have been formally agreed between the Civil Service trade union which represents clerical officers and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff member in question was appointed following open Civil Service competition and the offer of appointment in Dublin which was made to her specified that she would not be considered for transfer to any other location for a minimum <Col N="655" /> period of one year, which is in line with the central agreement on transfers. The person concerned recently took up her appointment in Dublin on that basis. While the person concerned has made application for transfer to Sligo, there are a significant number of serving clerical officers ahead of her on the transfer list and these would have to be considered before her for those clerical officer vacancies in the Department's offices in Sligo which will fall to be filled by transfer.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 586, 592, 600, 602, 604, 608, 612 and 616 together.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions applying to the former disabled person's maintenance allowance &ndash; disabled person's maintenance allowance &ndash; scheme was that the payment was not made to people who were in residential care or in hospital. People in this situation had their maintenance costs and an element of pocket money met through funding from the appropriate health board. However, since the take-over of the disability allowance scheme by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs this disqualification has been progressively relaxed, as follows: from October 1996 disability allowance is continued for up to 13 weeks where the person is admitted to hospital for treatment; with effect from June 1997 disability allowance was paid at half rate for those in part-time residential care. In addition, people who come home for an extended holiday period of three weeks or more can qualify for disability allowance for that period; since August 1999 existing recipients of disability allowance who are living at home can retain their entitlement where they subsequently go into hospital or residential care; from May 2000 people in part-time residential care who had been entitled to half rate disability allowance since June 1997 became entitled to payment at the full rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, people who are living in community-based residences are eligible to receive disability allowance provided the relevant health board is not providing funding towards their maintenance. These improvements now mean that many of those who had previously been disqualified for payment under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme because they were in residential care are now entitled to payment under the disability allowance scheme. Nevertheless, based on the limited data available it is estimated there are still in the region of 4,000 to 5,000 people with disabilities in residential care who are not entitled to disability allowance. This includes people with physical disabilities who have been in full-time residential care in Cheshire Homes since before August 1999. The cost of abolishing the residency rule for this group is esti<Col N="657" /> mated to be approximately £25 million &ndash; 32 million &ndash; per annum.</P>
    <P>Despite the recent improvements, it is recognised that more needs to be done. The potential for further improvements in this area is being examined in a budgetary context in the light of the available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 589, 590 and 607 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has since 1996 operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Since its commencement, a total of £22 million &ndash; 28 million &ndash; has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. I am anxious to ensure that the scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable people in our society and, accordingly, a sum of £3.5 million &ndash; 4.4 million &ndash; has been provided for the scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme grant aid is available towards the purchase and/or installation cost of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist. Under the terms of the scheme funding is available towards the once-off costs of obtaining or installing the relevant equipment. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers, my Department has no role in setting or abolishing such fees.</P>
      <P>Individuals wishing to obtain assistance under the scheme must do so by way of a voluntary or community-based group as grant aid is not provided directly to applicants. Details of individual beneficiaries of the scheme are not publicised in order to protect the confidentiality of vulnerable </P>
      <P>older people. Details of all organisations receiving funding under the scheme have however been made available to the Oireachtas Library each year from 1996 to 2000 for the information of Members. This information is provided in the format specified by the Deputy. Details of organisations funded under the 2001 scheme will be made available to the Oireachtas Library early in 2002.</P>
      <P>Applications from voluntary or community based groups seeking funding under the scheme are assessed locally by the various regional offices of my Department. In performing these assessments my Department is charged with ensuring that each application and the proposed beneficiaries satisfy the eligibility criteria of the scheme. I am anxious that this scheme continues to operate in a way that benefits the most vulnerable older people in our society. With this in mind my Department keep the administrative procedures applying to the scheme under review and make amendments as appropriate. My Department also monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis to ensure that those organisations receiving funding under the scheme are complying with all the scheme regulations and requirements.</P>

      <P>With reference to the selection procedures used by my Department to establish and enter into a contractual agreement with the Teamworks Support Agency, I have nothing to add to the information provided to the Deputy in reply to Question No. 356 on 9 October last.</P>
      <P>A contract for the support function was not advertised as my Department considered that the expertise to carry out that function already existed within the previous agency. That expertise transferred to Teamworks as agreed between the previous support agency and my Department. As stated previously, my Department's primary concern in this process was to ensure that adequate and acceptable support arrangements for projects were in place as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</P>
      <P>Teamworks was given a one year contract which is due for review at end 2001. The contract will be reviewed in line with procedures applying to all support agencies in the programme. In this context, it should be noted that the Department has set up a working group to examine the issue of selection and reselection of support agencies with a view to implementing an evaluation mechanism which will be agreed and supported by all parties within the programmes, that is, community projects within the programmes, the Department and support agencies themselves. This group is due to report on its findings shortly.</P>

On the basis that those aged 60-65 who were not already in receipt of a social welfare pension would have an underlying entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension, the cost could be of the order of £480 million, 609 million.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Christmas bonus payments are made to long-term welfare recipients to help alleviate hardship due to the additional demands on people's resources at Christmas time. The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. Any proposal to extend the bonus payment or national fuel scheme to recipients of short-term payments, such as unemployment benefit, would be inconsistent with these basic objectives and would create inevitable pressures for further extension to other short-term categories in the future.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question specifically refers to the position of people who return to the live register following a period of community employment and who, by virtue of having paid Class A PRSI contributions, qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit. The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided for the extension of Class A PRSI cover to community employment workers. This rate of contribution provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including unemployment benefit. Therefore a person applying for unemployment benefit following cessation of community employment is in the same position as any other person applying for unemployment benefit and secondary benefits are not payable. However, if a person was in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance prior to taking up community employment, he or she retains any secondary benefits while participating on the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Act, 2000, I introduced a change to these arrangements to enable such community employment workers who revert to the live register following completion of a period on a community employment scheme and who would have entitlement to unemployment benefit to opt instead to receive long-term unemployment assistance and therefore retain any</P>
      <P>secondary benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 595 to 599, inclusive, and 615 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. In budget 2001, in addition to the substantial weekly rate increases of £8 &ndash; 10.16 &ndash; for carers aged under 66 and £10 &ndash; 12.70 &ndash; for carers aged over 66, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the weekly income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 &ndash; 95.23 &ndash; to £125 &ndash; 158.72, for a single person and from £150 &ndash; 190.46, to £250 &ndash; 317.43, for a couple. The effect of this increase ensures that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100 &ndash; 19,173.04 &ndash; qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £26,000 &ndash; 33,013.19 &ndash; qualifies for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the <Col N="662" /> assessment of household incomes and the measures that I have introduced further enhance the qualification criteria for this scheme. As I announced in my budget speech last year, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>Carer's allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual to ensure that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. A person who would otherwise qualify for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance published in October 1998 proposed the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency. In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care. Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    <P>As regards care recipients returning to employment, one of the main conditions for receipt of the carer's allowance is that the person being cared for must be so invalided or disabled as to need full-time care and attention. A person is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention when s/he is so disabled or invalided that s/he requires from another person continual supervision in order to avoid danger to him/herself or continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with his/her normal personal needs, for example, help to walk and get about, eat or drink, wash, bathe, dress etc. In addition, the care recipient must be so disabled or invalided as to be likely to require full-time care and attention for a period of at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>When a care recipient takes up employment, that person is asked to submit a medical report from their doctor. This is examined by the chief <Col N="663" /> medical adviser of my Department who decides if the care recipient still requires full-time care and attention. If this is the case, the carer's allowance remains in payment, subject to all other qualifying conditions for receipt of carer's allowance being fulfilled. In addition, a carer continues to be regarded as providing full-time care and attention where the person being cared for is attending a non-residential course of rehabilitation training or a non-residential day care centre approved by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers continues to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others. The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

The Department also carries out periodic reviews to ensure that pensioners are receiving the correct rare of payment in accordance with their means.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently receiving a reduced old age non-contributory pension of £27.50, 34.92, per week, based on means of £73.47, 93.29, derived from a British retirement pension. Following a recent review of her claim, her old age non-contributory pension will be reduced to £9.50, 12.06, from a current date.

      <P>The submission received covers a wide range of issues relating to my Department, and the Departments of Finance, <Col N="666" /> the Environment and Local Government, Education and Science and Public Enterprise. The position in relation to the issues relating to my Department is as follows.</P>
      <P>The free electricity and telephone rental allowance schemes cover a certain amount of free usage in addition to ESB standing charges and telephone line rental. VAT charges on these elements of the ESB and telephone bills of those eligible are also covered under the schemes.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of a person being allowed accompany a pensioner availing of free travel, the position is that companion passes are only issued in certain circumstances. Under the companion free travel pass scheme, these passes are available to certain people who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables any person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge. In addition, since September 1998, all people aged 75 years or over who are unfit to travel alone qualify for a companion free travel pass. The question of extending the availability of the companion pass could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to increase the old age pension rate to £100, 126.97, by 2002. The improvements announced in budget 2001 saw the old age contributory pension increase to £106, 134.59, per week, the old age non-contributory pension increase to £95.50, 121.26, per week and the widow-widower's contributory pension for a person over 66 years of age increase to £102, 129.51, per week. Overall increases since 1997 amount to between £18, 22.86, and £28, 35.55, per week or 36% to 43%, which are well ahead of inflation. It is proposed that increases in 2002 will be applied from the beginning of January.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group considered that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price, including fuel, inflation. In that regard, the recent increases in primary payments have given a substantial real increase after fully compensating for inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs. While the Government has made significant improvements in social welfare pensions, both in terms of the payment rates and the numbers receiving <Col N="667" /> payments, it is also anxious to increase the level of private pension coverage. Currently this stands at less than 50% of those at work and it is hoped to increase this to a target 70% in the coming years. The recently published Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001, is designed to facilitate this process.</P>

      <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including increases in disability allowance, are matters to be decided in a budgetary context having regard to the available resources and in the light of the Government's other priorities.

The increases which I provided earlier this year are fully in line with this commitment.</P>

      <P>The use of advertising is a vital medium in the effective delivery of information in relation to social welfare services. In this regard, my priority has been to ensure that all citizens are fully aware of their entitlements and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur across the broad range of <Col N="668" /> social insurance, social assistance and other supports available.</P>
      <P>Since July 1997, 286 advertisements were placed by my Department in the print media, radio and television, 51 of which contained a reference to the Minister by name or title. The cost of those latter advertisements was £1,042,221&ndash;1,323347.60. One of these advertisements related to radio-television. This was a radio interview which I recorded in October 1998 for the &ldquo;It Pays to Work Campaign&rdquo; which was broadcast on all local radio stations at a cost of £16,691&ndash;21,193.20.</P>
      <P>The Department's public awareness campaign for the euro is now being developed in close consultation with the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland. The introduction of the euro presents a major challenge to ensure that all of our customers are aware of the changeover and its implications. In this connection my Department is paying particular attention to the needs of the hardest to reach categories, such as people with disabilities and those with low literacy skills. As part of this campaign, my Department is planning a professionally made commercial of suitable duration for use on television and on national and local radio. This commercial will run in December-January. In addition to the euro campaign, my Department is also planning a series of commercials regarding budget 2002 on television and on national and local radio. The purpose of these advertisements is to ensure that all our customers are aware of the changes in their entitlements arising from the budget and are fully informed as to the arrangements for the payment of budget increases in social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The free schemes, as currently constituted, provide a basic package of necessary benefits in the area of travel, electricity and telephone that ensure a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group. It is not within the scope of my Department to provide for all socially desirable items of expenditure. A recent review of the free schemes recommended that no further goods and services be covered by the schemes, unless their social benefit is clearly over and above that which can be purchased by increased income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might be interested to note that many private companies extend concessions to <Col N="669" /> pensioners in order to increase their business usage, as part of their social aims and as recognition of the value they have received from their customers over the years. In this regard, following previous requests for concessions on the cost of cable television, my officials wrote to the cable company concerned bringing the demands for such concessions to their attention.</P>

      <P>I met some time ago with representatives of the Irish Seal Sanctuary at their request to discuss their future plans for the sanctuary and officials from my Department later examined their draft development plan. The Irish Seal Sanctuary has made many approaches in the past for aid in running its existing facility at Garristown but the fact remains that the proposed new Rodgerstown sanctuary is a rehabilitation facility, which would cater for a relatively small number of injured seals rather than contributing to the overall conservation of the species. I have made it clear on previous occasions that my responsibility under the Wildlife Acts is to protect seals and other mammals to ensure the conservation of the species as a whole. The work carried out by the seal sanctuary is primarily welfare in character and, on this basis, the provision of funding from my Department does not arise.</P>

      <P>Development of sewage treatment facilities requires approval under the Planning and Development Acts. Under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, where a proposed development is likely to have a significant impact on management of a special area of conservation, a planning authority has a duty to ensure that an appropriate assessment of the implications of this development for the conservation status of the site is undertaken. Permission for the proposed development should be given only after it has been established that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site, unless the development has been necessitated by imperative reason of overriding public interest. This protection would be separate and additional to the protection <Col N="670" /> afforded by the designation of a water body as a sensitive area by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, for the purpose of urban waste water treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 622 and 638 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Lucan Demesne was acquired by my Department in 1996 with the objective of establishing a Liffey Valley park, to be owned and managed on a co-operative basis by the three local authorities concerned on the basis of an agreed management plan. The Lucan Demesne is a regional park and does not warrant designation as a national park.</P>
      <P>As I have advised previously on several occasions the position remains that only one of the three local authorities involved, South Dublin County Council, has completed the legal formalities in this case. Neither Fingal County Council nor Kildare County Council has yet completed the transfer documents. In addition, my Department has secured funding for the park for a five year period. Once the legal transfer of the land has been completed it will be possible to commence implementation of the management plan. The role of my Department will then be to disburse funds, allocated by the Department of Finance, on foot of projects carried out in accordance with the agreed management plan.</P>
      <P>Since acquiring the property in August 1996 both my Department and the Chief State Solicitor's office have done everything in their power to ensure that the transfer of the property is completed as expeditiously as possible. While my Department has been given to understand that Fingal Council and Kildare County Council are now agreeable to completing the legal formalities, it is a matter in the final analysis for both authorities to deliver in this regard and honour the commitments entered into by them in 1996.</P>

      <P>My Department has, in consultation with Meath County Council, identified the road referred to by the Deputy as one of the strategic Gaeltacht roads, which it is hoped will be improved during the currency of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> In this context, my Department has indicated to Meath County Council that it is prepared to provide funding of £150,000 per year, commencing this year and continuing for the duration of the national development plan to enable such improvement works to be carried out. However, no funding has to date been formally sanctioned by my Department for this project and, furthermore, I am not aware of any announcement of the provision of such funding.</P>
    <P>I understand Meath County Council appointed consultants to undertake a feasibility study of this road and that, based on the report received, the council has recently begun the public consultation process as part of Part X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994. As the public consultation process has only recently begun, the question of the total contract price for the project does not arise at this point. The amount paid to the consultants is a matter for Meath County Council in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Once the consultation and planning process has been completed and other issues have been resolved, the question of the provision of funding for the improvement of the road will be considered further. In this context, it is a matter for Meath County Council, in consultation with the Department of Environment and Local Government, to ensure that the additional funding which may be required to complete this project is provided. Neither I nor my Department has received any representations on this matter.</P>

      <P>The then Minister of State at this Department consented to the purchase by Údarás na Gaeltachta of the site in question in September 2000 to develop it for business-industrial purposes. Consequential action required in this regard and in relation to securing a suitable project for the site is a matter solely for the údarás.</P>
      <P>I understand that in order to progress the purchase it became necessary for the údarás to apply for new planning permission which was done in June of this year. Significant questions, particularly in relation to entry to and exit from the site, arose in the context of this application necessitating redesign of plans for the site. An amended application for planning permission was submitted to Galway County Council on 25 October last. It is intended to proceed with the purchase without delay as soon as planning permission is obtained.</P>
      <P>As regards the job potential of the site, the údarás has advised me that, subject to the availability of suitable projects and a suitable workforce, a job potential in the region of 50 persons would not be unreasonable having regard to the nature of the site. The general efforts by the údarás to promote job creation in this area and in other Gaeltacht areas are continuing. While the potential of the site has been brought to the attention of some promoters, the delay in completing the purchase as a result of the need to apply for fresh planning permission has made it difficult, however, to target projects specifically for the site in recent months. I look forward to a speedy completion of these matters.</P>

      <P>The Tinteán Theatre project was the subject of an application under my Department's ACCESS scheme for assisting arts and cultural capital projects. However, the independent committee established by me to assess applications under the scheme determined that the project did not meet the criteria necessary to allow it to be referred forward for consideration in the context of final grant allocations. Consequently, it was not possible to allocate any ACCESS funding to the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> As the Deputy will be aware, I subsequently met a deputation on behalf of Tintéan Theatre and I am happy to acknowledge the strong case made to me regarding the merits of the project. Given the full amount of the funding available to me for the ACCESS scheme had already been allocated, I can confirm to the Deputy that I have followed through on my commitment to seek possible additional funding.</P>

      <P>The works required to alleviate the flooding at Clara Castle are scheduled to take place shortly. There are no plans to carry out works to the internal floors at the castle nor are there plans to reroof the building. Such development work at Clara Castle is not provided for under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and, without carrying out substantial refurbishment works, the building would not be suitable for local use. There are, therefore, no plans to explore this issue with local community interests.</P>

      <P>There are no funds provided for the reroofing of Magdalen Castle, at Maudlin Street, Kilkenny, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and there are no plans for this work or for considering the castle's use as a museum as suggested by the Deputy. Such a project would, in the first instance, require an initiative from the local authority, which would then require the approval of the National Museum of Ireland. While I support the principle of making historic monuments available for local community use, I advise the Deputy that in most cases such monuments are not readily adaptable for modern use.</P>

    <P>The allocation of £5.005 million refers to programmes such <Col N="678" /> as land purchase, SAC compensation and improvement of visitor facilities at parks and nature reserves. This is provided on a national basis, as, by its nature, it cannot be broken down by county at this stage. The £114,000 expenditure represents spending which is not specific to one county.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will notice the considerable difference between the allocation and actual expenditure in this year to date. A number of factors have brought about this situation, not least the foot and mouth scare which affected progress in many of the projects, particularly those based in rural areas. Also, the projects to benefit under the ACCESS scheme have recently been selected, so it is likely that expenditure in respect of these projects will increase significantly in 2002 and in subsequent years.</P>

      <P>Following my decision in 1998 to designate 11,000 hectares of land in the Owenduff-Nephinbeg area of north west Mayo as Ireland's sixth national park, I established a working group to ensure the involvement of the local community in all decisions relating to the provision of the visitor centre at Ballycroy, including the name for the national park. When I visited Ballycroy in July 1998, I invited the local community to put forward their suggestions. The working group is made up of representatives of local community groups as well as officials of Mayo County Council, the Office of Public Works and my own Department. The working group has discussed the issue of the name for the national park at its most recent meeting on 17 October 2001 and I will announce my decision following full consideration of all the proposals put forward.</P>

      <P>The remit of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is to prevent damage to protected habitats and species. In discharge of this remit it carries out ongoing monitoring of protected areas and where it finds that unauthorised operations or activities are being carried out, which could have a negative impact on the conservation status of a site desig<Col N="679" /> nated under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, i.e. Natura 2000 sites, it will seek the co-operation of the developer to ensure that such activities or operations cease. If developers are unwilling to co-operate, then legal proceedings may be initiated, either by Dúchas or another appropriate authority. Dúchas will also insist on restoration of the site as far as is practicable to its former condition.</P>
      <P>Under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, where a proposed development is not directly connected with, or necessary to the management of, a special area of conservation but likely to have a significant impact on it, a planning authority or other authority has a duty to ensure that an appropriate assessment of the implications of this development for the site is undertaken. Permission for the proposed development should only be given where the relevant authority has satisfied itself that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site unless the development is required for reasons of overriding public interest. Generally speaking, Dúchas is consulted by the planning authorities in relation to developments at protected sites and opposes any development that seems to it to be likely to cause significant damage to such a site.</P>
      <P>The final decision on whether approval-authorisation is given is for the relevant Minister or planning authority. Activities or operations on a Natura 2000 site, or which are likely to have an adverse affect on a Natura 2000 site, require my consent which will not be forthcoming if the proposed activity or operation threatens the integrity of the site. I am not aware of any suggestion that delays in bringing forward a coastal zone management policy are attributable to Dúchas.</P>

      <P>I was not in a position to attend this informal meeting of culture Ministers due to important business at Cabinet on 18 May. Informal meetings of Ministers are hosted by the member state holding the Presidency of the European Union. These meetings provide the opportunity for political debate on various issues identified by the Presidency of being of particular importance. The German Presidency identified three areas for informal discussions at the meeting in question &ndash; the financial framework for the Culture 2000 Framework. culture and employment and European history and identity. There are no decisions taken at informal Council meeting and the Deputy will appreciate that, in those circumstances, attendance at the Cabinet meeting rather than the informal Council had to be my priority.</P>

      <P>Provision has been made in existing landlord and tenant legislation to prevent the creation of new ground rents and for the purchase of existing ground rents. In particular, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, has prevented the creation of new leases reserving ground rents on dwellings while the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the purchase of the fee simple in the case of dwelling houses. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 15 times the ground rent. To date, more than 74,600 people have purchased their ground rent under this scheme. There is no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the 1978 (No. 2) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1978 (No. 2) Act also contains provision for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where <Col N="682" /> the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases, the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. Moreover, the Act makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found.</P>
    <P>In so far as future legislation is concerned, the Government's current legislation programme makes provision for a Bill to abolish ground rents. The content of such a proposal is under examination by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office and the Land Registry, since it raises certain constitutional, technical and practical difficulties. I hope these difficulties can be overcome in a way that would improve on the readily available and reasonable system that already exists for the purchase of ground rents, and that the details of new legislation can be announced as early as possible in 2002.</P>

      <P>The issue of the cost to the economy of drug abuse was addressed in the report on the national drugs strategy, Building on Experience &ndash; National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The report emphasised that the cost of drug misuse at a societal level is extremely difficult to quantify as it encompasses areas like the public health costs of disease associated with drug dependence, the cost of acquisitive crime and associated losses and insurance costs which are borne by both business and individuals. The level of State spending on drugs-related issues is also difficult to estimate and is complicated by the fact that expenditure is spread across a number of Government Departments, local authorities, agencies and other statutory organisations.</P>
      <P>Even within Departments and agencies, it is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of costs associated specifically with drug misuse as services such as the Garda Síochána, the Prisons Service, the Courts and probation and welfare services, and the various health agencies, deal with drugs issues as part of their wider daily services.</P>
      <P>Bearing these limiting factors in mind, the report on the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 estimated that the development, co-ordination and delivery of the four pillars &ndash; supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research &ndash; that make up the strategy approximated to £144 million in 2000. This figure is broken down by Departments and agencies in the following table:</P>

    <P>Since its statutory inception in October 1996 and up to 31 December 2000 the Criminal Assets Bureau has obtained section 2 interim orders on property to a total value of over £8 million and section 3 interlocutory orders on property to a total value of over £7 million, under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. During the same period the bureau demanded more than £37 million in the payment of tax and interest from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity and social welfare determinations and savings amounted to more than £1.6 million. In addition, the bureau has collected £9.9 million in taxes.</P>
    <P>An interlocutory order may be made by the High Court under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which effectively freezes specified property which can be shown to be the proceeds of crime. If the interlocutory order remains in force for not less than seven years, then a disposal order may be sought. A disposal order will vest the property in the Minister for Finance, to be realised for the benefit of the Exchequer, or to such person as the court may determine. As the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, has not been in force for seven years no disposal orders have as yet been sought.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the bureau are set out in section 4 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996. There are currently no plans to extend the remit of the Bureau beyond the provisions of the 1996 Act.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, having considered the applications in respect of the persons in question, I decided not to grant certificates of naturalisation in these instances. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that the granting of a certificate of naturalisation is at my absolute discretion and it is not policy, therefore, to disclose the reasons for refusal in an individual case. Furthermore, the aforementioned Act does not contain any provisions for appeal against my decision. However, it is open to the persons referred to by the Deputy to apply again in the future provided that they comply with statutory requirements at the time of application.</P>

      <P>Section 15(1) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, sets out the conditions which an applicant for naturalisation must comply with. One of these conditions requires that the Minister is satisfied that an applicant is of full age. Consequently, as the person referred to by the Deputy is a minor, he cannot make an application on his own behalf at this time.</P>
      <P>However, section 16(<i>b</i>) of the Act provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation, although the conditions or any of them are not complied with &ldquo;where the applicant is a parent or guardian acting on behalf of a minor of Irish descent or Irish associations&rdquo;. The parent of the minor referred to in the Deputy's question is, therefore, entitled to make an application for naturalisation on his behalf. It will be necessary to submit details of the minor's Irish descent or Irish associations with the application.</P>
      <P>The relevant application form may be obtained from the citizenship section of my Department by telephoning the citizenship helpline, telephone number 01-602 8202, on any Tuesday and Thursday morning between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Nationals of Ecuador were removed from the list of nationalities exempted <Col N="685" /> from the Irish visa requirement with effect from 30 August 1997. This decision was taken following the imposition of a visa requirement on nationals of Ecuador by the UK on 1 August 1997. My understanding is that the UK had experienced a significant increase in the number of Ecuadorian nationals abusing the absence of a visa requirement in order to migrate illegally to the UK. In the light of the foregoing, it was considered prudent for Ireland also to introduce a visa requirement for the purposes of national immigration controls as well as to prevent persons from abusing the common travel area between Ireland and the UK in order to circumvent the UK visa requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission has proposed the adoption of a framework decision on a European arrest warrant. The stated purpose of the framework decision is to replace existing extradition procedures between member states of the European Union with a simplified procedure based on a European arrest warrant; in effect replacing inter-state extradition by an inter-court procedure. The proposed arrest warrant is based on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgments by member states and provides that each national judicial authority should recognise requests for the surrender of a person, made by the judicial authority of another Member State, with a minimum of formality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been discussions on the proposed European arrest warrant at two meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the issue has also been discussed on two occasions by the Heads of States and Government, most recently on Friday, 19 October in Ghent. At official level <Col N="688" /> there has also been intensive discussion on these proposals, and these discussions are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Discussions on the European arrest warrant are, in broad terms, informed by the view of the European Council that dual criminality should be abolished for a wide range of actions, in particular terrorist offences that give rise to a request for surrender. I cannot, at this stage, say what shape the final instrument will take &ndash; there are divergent views among the member states on how best to achieve the desired result. Our position in the negotiations so far has been that the proposals do raise certain difficulties. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot be more specific at this time as negotiations on the proposal are ongoing and revised texts emerge arising from the discussions.</P>

      <P>The person in question was granted permission to remain in the State in January, 1997 on the basis that he was residing here with his UK national wife and their Irish born &ndash; Irish citizen &ndash; child. When he sought to renew his permission in May 2001 it emerged that his wife and child were residing in Scotland and that he had not resided with them for two years. As the basis for his permission to remain no longer applied, he was refused a renewal of this permission in October 2001 and invited to write to the Department setting out whether there were other grounds upon which he wished to seek permission to remain. My Department has not yet received a response to that letter.</P>
      <P>In order to enter the UK, the person in question should make an application to the UK authorities for an entry visa. In so far as his entitlement to return to the State is concerned, this is dependent on whether or not he has permission to remain here. Accordingly, he should respond to the above letter together with any information relevant to his application to continue to reside here.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all vehicles purchased by the <Col N="689" /> Garda Síochána comply with health and safety legislation. All ancillary equipment also complies with health and safety regulations and is fitted in accordance with best practice and procedures. Garda cars are subject to the road traffic &ndash; national car test &ndash; regulations and are also regularly serviced and maintained in accordance with the manufacturers instructions. I am also informed that every endeavour is made to ensure that members of the Garda Síochána are provided with a safe working environment in the course of duty.</P>
      <P>The Garda fleet is being constantly upgraded in order to ensure that the most modern facilities are available to members of the Garda Síochána in the performance of their duties. Provision is made in the Garda Vote each year for the purchase-delivery of vehicles for the Garda fleet and the maintenance of existing vehicles. This year alone, more than IR£6 million &ndash; 7.6 million &ndash; will be spent on the purchase of new vehicles.</P>
      <P>A Garda transport advisory group has been set up to review the optimum size and structure of the Garda fleet and overall fleet replacement policy.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 14 vehicles assigned to Naas Garda station, including one public order Ford Transit van. I am also informed that on 26 August 2001 the official patrol car was taken out of service due to maintenance problems. A transit van which was on permanent allocation to Naas was then assigned as a replacement for the official patrol car. The van was 00 registered and in excellent condition. It acted as the patrol car for the regular units until 3 October 2001 when a new patrol car became available and was allocated to Naas. In this period, the van registered 9,000 miles.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that this was considered an adequate, albeit temporary, replacement for a patrol car pending the issue of the new patrol car. The van was in excellent working condition and no difficulties were encountered during the period for which a patrol car was not available. The van had full Garda markings and afforded a very high degree of visibility when patrolling.</P>

No applications of this type were processed in 1998, as the basis for granting such permission was under review at that time. In 1997, 107 current or former asylum applicants were granted permission to remain on the basis of their parentage of an Irish citizen. Figures are not available for the number of persons other than current or former asylum seekers granted permission to remain on this basis in 1997.</P>

      <P>Public service vehicle inspectors are members of the Garda Síochána. Consequently, the assignment of additional duties to public service vehicle inspectors is a Garda operational matter and, therefore, comes within the remit of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner has set up a working group chaired by the chief superintendent, Garda national traffic bureau, to examine the role of PSV inspectors and to establish how this could be more effective in the area of road safety. It is expected that the working group will report before the end of this year. Currently, PSV inspectors are actively involved in road traffic accident investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 668 and 669 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> Under-age drinking and anti-social behaviour by young persons are complex and, on occasion, interlinked issues that require a combination of preventative and enforcement strategies, of which legislative measures can only ever be one component. Nevertheless, there already exists a wide range of relevant legislation, to which reference only to the main provisions may be made here.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, is designed to make it as difficult as possible for persons under the age of 18 years to be sold alcohol, to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, strengthens the law in this regard by providing for the removal of the &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; defence of licence holders in selling alcohol to under-age persons and by providing that, where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person is upheld, the licensed premises may be closed for a specified period.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, makes it an offence for any person to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that she or he might be a danger to himself or herself or to any other person in the vicinity. These provisions, in conjunction with the voluntary age card scheme that I introduced in 1999, will contribute further to the combating of under-age drinking in public places.</P>
    <P>With specific regard to public order, section 5 of the 1994 Act creates the offence of disorderly conduct in a public place; section 6 creates the offence of using or engaging in any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; and section 8 empowers the Garda Síochána to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons who are loitering in a public place in circumstances which give rise to apprehension for the safety of persons or property or the maintenance of the public peace.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that existing legislation is adequate to deal with the issues of under-age drinking and anti-social behaviour. However, although I have no plans for legislative change, the operation of the law in these areas will continue to be kept under review by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a pilot version of the arrangement suggested by Deputy Keaveney was established in June 2001 in west Cork, incorporating four Garda districts that include the towns and hinterland of Kinsale, Bandon, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Bantry, Castletownbere and Macroom. The <Col N="694" /> west Cork youth council was initiated by local Garda juvenile liaison officers under the direction of the chief superintendent for the area in order to develop a co-ordinated response to youth crime in this mainly rural area. The council is a cross-agency initiative aimed at providing support and services for young people at risk in the 12 to 21 age group. The council is currently carrying out a needs assessment of young people in its area of responsibility. I understand the pilot scheme is still in its early stages and has yet to be evaluated, the outcome of which will inform a decision on its wider applicability.</P>
      <P>With specific regard to the Garda division of Donegal, I am also informed that a number of cross-departmental youth-focused initiatives are already in place, including an inter-agency approach to tackling drugs and alcohol problems and a new initiative to reduce the number of early school leavers. Moreover, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, my Department funds a multi-agency supported Garda youth diversion project in Raphoe, County Donegal.</P>

I assure the Deputy there will be no undue delay in acting on it. In addition, the Office of Public Works is currently seeking to acquire a green field site or alternatively the adjacent FCA site to facilitate the construction of a new or refurbished station at Portlaoise. It is not possible at this stage to give a timescale for the commencement of this project.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV <Col N="698" /> system in Drogheda was received last week by the advisory committee that was established by the commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. The application from Drogheda will now be considered by the committee &ndash; together with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country.

      <P>Our courts system has recently undergone the most comprehensive and radical reform of court administration since the foundation of the State. In November 1999 I established the independent Courts Service on a statutory basis under the Courts Service Act, 1998. Under the Act, responsibility for the management of the courts system is now conferred on the Courts Service.</P>
      <P>The structures which have now been put in place will put the Courts Service in a much better position to meet the demands placed on it and to provide a first class service for judges, practitioners, court staff and most importantly of course, the users of the system. In order to reflect the Government's commitment to ensuring the success of the Courts Service, I have obtained Government approval for an increase in the allocation to the courts Vote from £30.4 million, 38.6 million, in 1997 to £64.9 million, 82.4 million this year &ndash; a 113% increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Courts Service has published a strategic plan for the period 2000 to 2003 in which it set out the high level goals of the organisation, having regard to its statutory mandate. In line with Government policy on decentralisation the Courts Service is in the process of establishing seven regional offices to provide a local administrative structure for the service. These offices will <Col N="704" /> have responsibility for devolved functions in a wide range of areas, including IT, building projects, human resource issues, streamlining of procedures, budgetary matters, etc. I have provided funding for an additional 21 staff to implement these new regional structures. This will assist in ensuring the effective and efficient delivery of court services at local level.</P>
    <P>The Courts Service's strategic plan also recognises that information technology has the potential to transform the way the courts work, and provide the foundation for the future delivery of high quality services to all court users and at the same time implement Government policy in relation to the information society. To this end, the Courts Service has prepared a five year strategy for information technology entitled &ldquo;eCourts&rdquo;, which has been submitted to my Department and the Department of Finance. The funding of this plan is currently being considered by my Department and the Department of Finance. I might mention, in this regard, that I have secured an increase in the provision for IT development in the courts of over 700%, that is, from £954,000, 1.2 million, in 1997 to £7.8 million, 9.9 million this year. This has allowed the service to make significant progress already in the IT area.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive statistics in regard to waiting times generally were published in the Courts Service annual report, 2000, which is available in the Oireachtas Library. With regard to the issue of waiting times for the hearing of cases, I am aware that delays exist in relation to the hearing of cases in the Central Criminal Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal and divorce and judicial separation matters in some Circuit Court venues. In the latter regard I arranged, with Government approval, for the appointment of an additional judge of the Circuit Court in February last year and the appointment of a further extra judge in January of this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the High Court, provision is being made in the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001, at present before Dáil Éireann, for an increase in the number of ordinary judges which may be assigned to the High Court from 24 to 25. There are also proposals in the same Bill for significant changes in the civil jurisdictions of the Circuit Court and District Court which may impact on the numbers of judges needed in the various courts and I will be keeping this matter under review.</P>
    <P>In so far as the provision of courthouse accommodation is concerned, section 5 of the Courts Service Act, 1998, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the functions of the service shall be: to provide, manage and maintain court buildings, and to provide facilities for court users. I am pleased to have been able to obtain Government approval for the allocation of significant funds for courthouse upgrading in recent years. During the lifetime of this Government, the financial provision for court buildings has increased from £8.9 million, 11.3 <Col N="705" /> million, to £22.5 million, 28.6 million, which represents an increase of over 150%.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board does not routinely record information relating to an average waiting time for people seeking a consultation with a solicitor. In relation to applicants for legal services, the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and cases where there are time limits. In these cases the application is dealt with immediately. The board does, however, record the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited. The board has two law centres in Cork which are located on Popes Quay and the South Mall. The longest waiting time as at 30 September 2001 for Popes Quay and South Mall is two months and six months, respectively.</P>

    <P>In addition, an amount of activity under this measure will have national application. This includes support for the national framework committee to develop family friendly initiatives at the level of the enterprise. Individual projects have <Col N="708" /> yet to be identified under this strand or under the strand for the gender proofing of personnel policies. Expenditure to date on the measure is £508,392, 645,523. It is anticipated that expenditure in all areas of the measure will increase in the second half of 2001 as the projects commence activity.</P>
    <P>Under the employment and human resources development operational programme, the NDP gender equality unit has been allocated £4.22 million, 5.36 million, for the period 2000 to 2006. The unit has been established to promote equal opportunities between women and men, in particular, through a gender mainstreaming approach. Thus, unit spending has a nationwide effect. For example, representatives from all 26 counties have attended training provided by the unit.</P>
    <P>Spending to end June 2001 by the unit was £91,717, 116,456 which includes staffing costs. The unit has however incurred the following payments at county level relating to external work carried out by the unit: £44,104, 56,000, has been paid to Dublin based payees; £500, 635, to a payee in Kildare; £11,813, 15,000, in Roscommon; £1,575; 2,000, in Offaly; £1,181, 1,500, in Laois; and £599, 760, in Galway.</P>
    <P>The crime prevention measure the Prisons Service has incurred the following expenditure in preparing ex-offenders for employment after their release: Dublin-Mountjoy, Dóchas centre, training unit Wheatfield, Arbour Hill and Shelton Abbey &ndash; £3,417,162.10, 4,338,901; Cork &ndash; Cork Prison and Spike &ndash; £3,243, 4,118; Limerick &ndash; Limerick Prison &ndash; £178, 226; Wicklow &ndash; Shelton Abbey &ndash; £495, 629; Laois &ndash; Midlands Prison &ndash; £88,343, 112,172.</P>

    <P>Expenditure by the probation and welfare service under the NDP provides for new interventions <Col N="709" /> such as pre-employment training and education for offenders, referrals for substance abuse treatment and programmes for sex offenders. It also provides capital funding for probation centres. It is not possible to specify spending to date in each county as there are no pre-determined allocations for specific counties. It may be that offenders will avail of some of these services who are now resident outside of their county of origin &ndash; for example, hostels &ndash; or who have come before the courts in other counties, or who are serving custodial sentences in prisons and places of detention not located in their home county.</P>
    <P>In addition, since January 2001 the probation and welfare service provides funding for two prison-community link projects, one in Dublin and one in Cork. The Dublin based project has an allocation of £60,000, 76,200 for 2001, of which £19,830, 25,200 has been forwarded to the project. The Cork project has received its full 2001 allocation of £65,000, 82,500.</P>
    <P>The expenditure allocated at county level to date under the Garda youth diversion programme and a number of community-based drug use awareness projects is set out below. A further allocation may occur in respect of these projects during 2001 subject to submission of detailed accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has responsibility for leading the development of child care service delivery in Ireland. A sum of £344 million, comprising EU and Exchequer funding, has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. This represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State. The funding, which has a focus on equal opportunities and social inclusion, is being promoted as the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000-06 and is targeted at services which offer day care facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the announcement of the availability of funding in April 2000, I have committed funding in excess of £59 million to child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sector. Up to the end of October, over 23,500 child care places will be supported by this funding which will ensure both the continuation of existing places and the creation of over 10,400 new child care places. In addition, the funding will enable many of the services to extend their hours <Col N="711" /> of operation and enhance the quality of service provided. The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda. In addition, I have approved funding of over £10.3 million for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, innovative projects, local child care training models, the child minders initiative and supports for the national voluntary child care organisations. Funding of almost £1.9 million has also been allocated to local partnerships. This brings the total amount allocated to date under the equal opportunities child care programme to over £71.3 million.</P>
    <P>The general guidelines indicate that applications are processed in quarterly cycles and the majority of applications would receive a decision in this timeframe. Obviously this will depend on the details supplied by each applicant at the time of submitting the application. The more comprehensive the application, the less requirement for additional information during the assessment process. There will be no undue delay in processing applications under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme and if he has any specific case in mind I will be happy to provide him with a specific response on the timing of dealing with that specific application.</P>
    <P>For the Deputy's information, I will outline the procedure involved in processing an application received under the equal opportunities child care programme. Once an application is logged, and an acknowledgement letter is issued from my Department, the application is forwarded to Area Development Management Limited, which acts on behalf of my Department in appraising and assessing each application.</P>
    <P>During this consultation process the details of the project, including the costings of the work, are confirmed by ADM Limited, with the applicant. Required site visits will also take place, particularly with large capital projects or applications under the staffing grants scheme. Large capital projects are also appraised by an external specialist. Appraisals are subject to quality assurance procedures. Once the appraisal process is complete, the assessment is submitted to the programme appraisal committee which in turn makes a recommendation to me for a final decision. Successful applicants are then required to enter into a contract, on my Department's behalf, with ADM Limited. Any outstanding issues will be discussed with the applicants at contract stage.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, when committing public moneys to projects it is incumbent on my Department's equal opportunities child care section to take every reasonable step to ensure that applications for funding comply with the relevant rules and regulations, such as EU regulations on grant aid under the Structural Funds, and that the recommendations made to me have been properly evaluated under the criteria of the grant schemes.</P>

      <P>The crime statistics for each year are published in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, which are available in the Oireachtas Library for each year up to and including 1999. Approximately 120 types of indictable offence are divided into four groups and presented in detail in four large format tables to show the volume of offences recorded, the results of proceedings taken and the age and gender of persons who have been convicted. The statistics are presented on a national, a regional and a Garda divisional basis.</P>
      <P>The method of compiling statistics will change with the publication of the annual report of the Garda Síochána for 2000 and subsequent years as input from the new PULSE computer technology will contribute to the report. PULSE will have a major impact on the management and compilation of all information within the Garda system including crime details and statistics, but due to the considerable complexity of the technology involved this change will be introduced on a phased basis over a number of years.</P>
      <P>The full impact of the PULSE programme, allowing greater detail and analysis of statistical information, will become evident over time as the Garda Síochána moves from recording a relatively small proportion of crime statistics on computer to the position where paper based recording of crime statistics will no longer exist.</P>

      <P>I am conscious that some applications for Garda CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee established by the Commissioner relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to local interests to install and monitor the schemes, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Gardaí will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will also have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon. It will be open to the estate referred to by Deputy Upton to consider applying for a community-based CCTV system under this new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 707 and 710 together.</P>
      <P>The Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau are working closely together with a view to responding to the dramatic and unprecedented increase in the number of non-nationals seeking to register or renew their permission to remain at the immigration registration office at Harcourt Square. The number of persons per annum attending the office has increased from 12,803 in 1998 to 17,064 in 1999, 26,641 in 2000 and more than 47,000 in the first ten months of 2001. The number for the first 10 months of 2001 therefore represents a 76% increase in the number for the whole of 2000. I understand from the Garda authorities that it would not be possible to provide a monthly breakdown of these figures without a disproportionate diversion of staff resources from the core business of dealing with persons seeking to register. In this regard it should be noted that prior to 21 September 2001 the Garda registration system was entirely paper-based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiatives under way or planned for the registration office are set out in some detail in my response to Question No. 453 of 16 October 2001. These include additional resources, longer opening hours, computerisation of the registration process and streamlining of operating procedures. There are no plans at present to establish additional registration offices in the Dublin area. Instead, I am pleased to be able to advise the Deputies that the Office of Public Works has in <Col N="715" /> recent days signed a contract to purchase new and far larger accommodation for the registration office, which will be ready for occupation by the middle of next year. The intention is that the new accommodation will provide a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for legally resident non-nationals in the Dublin area as it will also accommodate the immigration and citizenship division of my Department together with the Visa Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the above initiatives and particularly the new accommodation will mean that persons seeking to register or avail of the other immigration-related services provided to non-nationals will be able to do so without delay or undue inconvenience. I understand that the person referred to by both Deputies was registered by the Garda authorities last Sunday along with numbers of other people whom it had not been possible to accommodate previously.</P>

      <P>The following information details the costs involved. The production costs totalled £1,100 or 1,396. The advertisement was transmitted 12 times on Radio 1, 28 times on 2FM and 21 times on Today FM. There are no further slots booked. The advertising campaign ran from 22 October to 28 October and is now finished. The average unit cost per transmission was £193.85 or 246.14. The cost for the radio advertising campaign came to £12,925 or 16,411.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, launched the plan on 16 October 2001. The plan is designed to guide and inform a consultation process leading to a National Plan for Women for the next five years. The consultation process will culminate in a public forum which is due to be held in the early part of 2002. It is hoped to publish the final plan before the summer. The Department considered radio advertising to be a crucial part of the overall advertising campaign. It was also considered that radio advertisements would have maximum impact if the Minister of State with special responsibility for equality issues were to do the voice part of the radio advertisements.</P>
      <P>The radio advertising campaign received unprecedented response from the public. Over 700 calls have been received on the Lo-Call number set up by the Department, the majority of which are a direct result of the radio advertisement. The launch of the draft plan formally commenced the consultation process. The Government anticipates the involvement of a large number of women's representative groups, other NGOs, the social partners and other stakeholders and women generally as well as the statutory and private sectors. The involvement of women and their representative groups are essential to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive consultation process.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers has applied for a transfer to serve the balance of his sentence here under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997, require that I must be satisfied that the acts or omissions constituting the offence of the applicant would also constitute an offence under Irish law before I can consent to a transfer. The Chief State Solicitor advises me in relation to this matter and has raised some queries which have been referred to the United Kingdom authorities. On receipt of the final advice of the Chief State Solicitor I will be in a position to decide on consenting to the application. A three-way consent is required to enable any transfer to take place, meaning consent from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents and assuming they are forthcoming, an application will be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here. Although it is not possible at this stage to say how long it will take for this application to be completed, I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to complete the process as quickly as possible.</P>

As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least six further area systems will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>

I <Col N="718" /> am also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee established by the Commissioner relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Gardaí will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>In 1998, the Government decided to extend Shannon Development's geographical remit to include the north Kerry area, while Cork-Kerry Tourism, under the aegis of the Regional Tourism Authority, continued to have responsibility for south Kerry. As an integrated development agency for the mid-west region, part of Shannon Development's role is to initiate and support tourism promotion and development as a key element in the achievement of overall economic growth throughout the region.</P>
      <P>I understand that both the Kerry County Development Board and the county manager are at present examining the implications of these arrangements for tourism promotion and development in the county. Any change in the geographical remit of Shannon Development would require amending legislation, which would be a matter for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Any change in the remit of the Regional Tourism Authority would be a matter for Bord Fáilte and the Regional Tourism Authority.</P>

      <P>A contract to provide executive <Col N="719" /> services has been completed by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited &ndash; CSID &ndash; with Magahy and Company. The contract is for a five year period but contains a provision for earlier termination in certain circumstances with a provision for compensation. Approval has also been given for a number of smaller contracts for technical surveys relating to services and preparatory work on the site. Much of the survey work has already been completed at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Government has given approval to proceed with the development of an aquatic and leisure centre at the site in Abbotstown. In July 2000 the project went to tender, offering a contract for the design, build, maintenance and financing of the centre. Heads of agreement have been signed by CSID and terms of agreement are currently at the stage of final negotiations. Meanwhile, as the aim is to have the pool at Abbotstown completed in time for the Special Olympics in 2003, work has begun on the site under a letter of intent which includes provision for termination.</P>
      <P>CSID has sought tenders for the provision of a stadium and other sporting facilities for the Sports Campus Ireland project under EU procurement directives on a design, build, finance, operate and maintain basis. However this tendering process is still under way and contract terms, including any exit provisions, will not arise until a preferred bidder has been selected and the final contract negotiation process commences.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided that an independent overview be undertaken by consultants in order to assist the Government in determining final Exchequer allocations for Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland. I expect to receive the overview report, which was carried out by High-Point Rendel, within the next week or so.</P>

    <P>No actual expenditure has yet been incurred from the £105 million &ndash; 133 million &ndash; allocated to the regional operational programmes under the tourism sub-measures 1-3 of the local enterprise development priority, as the tourism product investment scheme, the vehicle for the expenditure, has had to be notified for the first time to the European Commission in line with the rules on State aid. Once clearance is secured, the scheme will be launched and project proposals will be invited by Bord Fáilte Éireann, who will administer the scheme. Nor has any expenditure been incurred to date from the £85 million &ndash; 107 million &ndash; allocated to the regional operational programmes for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme.

    <P>Additionally, £32.2 million &ndash; 40.9 million &ndash; has been spent to date under the tourism marketing fund of the productive sector operational programme under the NDP. Due to the nature of this expenditure, it is not possible to disaggregate it on a county basis.</P>

      <P>Questions relating to specific marketing and advertising programmes of the state tourism marketing agencies fall within the day-to-day competence of the bodies in question. However, I understand that Bord Fáilte recently circulated to members of the Houses of the Oireachtas details of their calendar of autumn promotions, including activities envisaged in the United States up to the end of the year. These activities include the promotion of special fares <Col N="724" /> and holiday packages for Christmas and the New Year, which will be financed out of funds at the disposal of the Bord, including additional Exchequer funding of £7 million &ndash; 8.8 million &ndash; for the tourism marketing reassurance campaign designed to help offset the adverse impact of the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
      <P>The latest official CSO statistics for visitor numbers from North America are for the six month period ended 30 June 2001 which show a decline of 3.9% in visitor numbers compared to the same period last year.</P>

      <P>Following the public advertising of the 2001 sports capital programme more than 1,450 applications were received. All of the applications were assessed in accordance with assessment criteria outlined in the Guidelines, Terms and Conditions governing the programme. A total of £44.2 million &ndash; 56.2 million &ndash; was allocated to 703 projects in 2001 under the programme.</P>
      <P>Every applicant organisation, including those in County Cork, subsequently received correspondence from my Department in relation to the assessment of their application. Those organisations being allocated a grant were advised on requirements and procedures for the drawdown of their grants and in accordance with established practice each of the individual unsuccessful applicants was given a copy of their respective assessment sheet including scores and explanatory comments, where appropriate, under each of the criteria used in assessing the applications.</P>

The cost of advertisements in respect of the sports capital programme since I took office amounted to approximately £41,000, including the cost of advertisements for the 2001 round of funding.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third-level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The local authorities administer the schemes on behalf of the Department, which reviews the schemes annually. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of the Department, by the vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant. It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, for example where advice regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice has been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers <Col N="728" /> that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his-her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively the local authority or VEC may in exceptional circumstances seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC all enquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise due to their financial circumstances be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to help them to remain in college. I increased the provision for this fund significantly from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 727 and 835 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance at approved courses in approved third level institutions: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. The arrangements for the payment of maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme are a matter for the local authorities, which are statutorily entrusted with <Col N="729" /> the administration of the scheme under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968. My Department understands from officials at Louth County Council that the first instalment of maintenance grant for the 2001-2 academic year is due to issue to successful applicants on 6 November 2001. County Louth Vocational Education Committee, which administers the VEC scholarship scheme, has confirmed that the first instalment of maintenance grant was issued to successful applicants on 22 October last. While the vocational education committees assess applications under the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, the third level institutions approved under the scheme are responsible for payment of the maintenance grants to individual students. The Department understands that for the current academic year Dundalk IT has commenced payments to successful applicants.</P>

      <P>My Department has received an application for grant aid towards the cost of a building project at Scoil Mhuire national school, Ballyhogue, County Wexford. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation this year is £370.5 million or 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. Decisions relating to the rate of progress of construction of individual projects, including Scoil Mhuire national school, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming estimates.</P>

      <P>The vocational education committees scholarship scheme administered by the various vocational education committees, under the aegis of my Department, offers financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third level courses in approved institutions, including certain institutions in Northern Ireland. An approved course, for the purposes of the VEC scheme, is generally a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years' duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year's duration pursued in an approved third level institution. The institutions approved under the scheme are generally publicly-funded third level colleges offering full-time courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level. Each year the approved third level institutions are listed in the VEC scheme. The Armagh College of Further and Higher Education is not, however, an approved institution under the scheme. Securing approval under the scheme is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant college authorities. My Department will forward details of the VEC scheme to the college authorities in order to facilitate their consideration of the matter.</P>

The group has produced a number of reports to date and periodically updates its analyses of the labour market and skills requirements. It is an independent body in relation to its findings, conclusions and recommendations.</P>
      <P>The ten recommendations referred to by the Deputy relate to those made by the group in its third report of July 2001 about the information and communications technology, or ICT, sector. The group is undertaking a review of the assumptions underlying the recommendations with regard to the downturn in the US economy and in the ICT sector and the tragic events of 11 September. The principal recommendation of the group in relation to ICT sector is for a special investment of £130 million or 165.07 million to be provided over five years for third-level skills provision. As I indicated previously, the resource implications of the group's recommendations will be addressed in the context of the Government's consideration of the annual Estimates.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 737 and 815 together.</P>
      <P>The figure of £9,670,000 quoted in my written reply of 9 October 2001 was incorrect and should have read £967,000. I have already explained to the House this mistaken shift in the decimal point which occurred in the transmission of the reply. The incorrect figure arose from a clerical error in my Department. I have arranged to have the record of the House amended to reflect the true position and as I stated in the House I very much regret any inconvenience which this error may have caused. I also clarified this matter to the media and it was reported in the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of £967,000 represents the estimated level of funding which will be allocated by my Department in 2001 in respect of the operating costs of the three pilot facilities in question. This figure is comprised as follows: £752,000 for the facility based in Cork, including an estimated £575,000 in salary costs; £121,700 for the facility based in Dublin, including an estimated £72,800 in salary costs; and £93,000 for the facility based in Kill, County Kildare, including an estimated £68,000 in salary costs. In each case, the funding allocation referred to covers the overall operating costs of the facilities including salary costs, consultancy costs, material and equipment costs, training costs, secretarial costs and the costs of <Col N="734" /> utilities. In the case of the facility at Kill the Department has also recently granted formal approval for expenditure of £226,798 for the provision of a prefabricated building and associated site development work to accommodate the facility. The facilities in Dublin and Kill have been established in the current school year and the facility in Cork was established in 1999. Funding allocations to the latter since its establishment amounted to £258,579 in 1999 and £355,523 in year 2000. This year, the capacity of the facility has been expanded from 12 to 30 children. The figures quoted above reflect this development.</P>
    <P>With regard to the e-mail message to which Deputy Lawlor refers, I have to say that in view of the efforts made by my Department to accommodate the projects in question, I find its content to be completely unacceptable and offensive. If Deputy Lawlor will advise me of the particular releases and statements he has in mind, I will gladly comment further on these matters.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme is operated through the 33 vocational education committees. It has 5,000 approved places with a current annual running cost of approximately £32 million. Its purpose is to provide educational opportunities for unemployed people, mainly those on the live register, in order to enhance their prospects of employment. As the scheme was specifically designed to address the needs of those who are unemployed there are no plans at present to extend it to those over 65 and as demand for places from people who are currently eligible to join VTOS exceeds supply the admission of new categories of participant to the scheme would not be appropriate at present.</P>
      <P>There are no age barriers governing free participation on full-time post Leaving Certificate courses for those who wish to do so. Neither will there be any upper age limit for participation in the back to education initiative announced in the White Paper on Adult Education, which will provide for the availability of part-time options under Youthreach, post leaving certificate courses and the VTOS. In the case of older people admission may be free or for a reduced fee, depending on means and educational attainment.</P>

      <P>The Department has received an application for grant aid towards the cost of a building project at the school in question. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million or 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants. The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of claimants of long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over. To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he or she must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. The three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level students attending approved courses in approved third level insti<Col N="741" /> tutions funded by my Department are the higher education grants scheme, administered by the local authorities; the Vocational Education Committees' scholarship scheme, administered by the vocational education committees; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, administered by the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases where for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has to date been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation. Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 755 and 756 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is referring to the new programme Giving Children an Even Break, launched by me in January last to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will run over a three-year period and will cost some £26 million, 33,013,190.04. The new programme involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to more than 2,300 primary schools that have been identified as having pupils enrolled with characteristics of disadvantage. The schools being targeted under the new programme were iden<Col N="743" /> tified through a comprehensive survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to participate and over 75% of primary schools responded with completed survey questionnaires. The programme has separate urban and rural dimensions. In the urban dimension, 203 schools are being supported to implement a PTR of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; up to and including second class &ndash; and 29:1 in senior classes over the period of the programme. No urban schools in County Monaghan were considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome. A breakdown of these post allocations by county is being forwarded to the Deputy for his information. Schools in areas with populations less than 1,500 people were categorised as rural. A total of 318 rural schools have been selected for inclusion in 73 clusters. Each cluster will be allocated the services of a teacher-coordinator.</P>
    <P>A county breakdown of schools included in clusters is provided in appendix 2 for the Deputy's information. Three rural schools in County Monaghan were considered eligible for clustering, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome. However, there were insufficient schools with similarly high levels of need within the locality to make a viable rural cluster, which normally involves five such schools. It was therefore not possible to form a cluster involving these three schools. The schools have been provided with additional financial assistance as an alternative to teacher-coordinator support. The addresses of the three schools in question will be sent to the Deputy. All schools selected for inclusion in the new programme will receive additional funding for the delivery of targeted in-school and out-of-school actions. 14 urban schools and 28 rural schools in County Monaghan are in receipt of such funding under the new programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions as follows: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered on behalf of my Department by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant. It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where for example advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
      <P>It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all enquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate <Col N="746" /> manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question was 84 pupils on 30 September 2000. This enrolment entitles the school to a staffing of a principal and three mainstream class teachers for the 2001-2002 school year. The school also has the services of a teacher for non-national pupils. This school applied for an additional teacher on developing grounds for the school year 2001-2002 based on a projected enrolment of 123 pupils on 30 September 2001. As the enrolment on 30 September <Col N="747" /> 2001 amounted to only 120 pupils, the school did not meet the developing school criteria.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for the operation of five special schools for young offenders. They are St. Joseph's Special School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel, County Tipperary; Trinity House School, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre, Kildonan Road, Finglas West, Dublin 11; Oberstown Girls Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; and Oberstown Boys Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>St. Joseph's school has a current operational capacity of 36 beds and all beds are available for use at present. Trinity House School currently has an operational capacity of 24 beds and all beds are currently available for use. Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre has a current operational capacity of 39 beds. The number of beds available for use at present is 27. The reduction in capacity is as a result of essential renovations being carried out at present in the centre and the increased number of High Court admissions that require higher than normal staffing ratios.</P>
      <P>The centre has also experienced some staff retention and recruitment difficulties. Oberstown Girls Centre currently has an operational capacity of 15 beds. The number of beds available for use is currently eight. This reduction is primarily due to a recent environmental health report, which has necessitated the carrying out of urgent refurbishment works to the units in general, and particularly to the kitchen areas. Oberstown Boys Centre has a current operational capacity of 17 beds, all of which are currently available for use. This operational capacity is reduced as a result of refurbishment works carried out to the residential units. The operational capacity will increase by five beds to 22 beds later this month and by a further four beds shortly thereafter to bring the total operational capacity of this centre up to 26 beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is conscious of its responsibility to ensure that there are adequate places available to accommodate children who have been convicted or placed on remand by a court. Arrangements are in place to monitor that the number of places available for these young people on a regular basis and steps have also been taken to ensure that management at the centres are also aware of their responsibilities in the matter. Centres have indicated that the response to recent staff recruitment drives has <Col N="748" /> been better than expected and outstanding vacancies are now being filled. I have also commissioned a review of the existing residential service provision under my Department with a view to ensuring that available places are being used optimally. The outcome of this review will inform future plans in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993 my Department issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
      <P>Under health and safety legislation, school management authorities are responsible for providing a safe environment for all personnel present in the school, including pupils. In a circular relating to guidelines on violence in schools, issued by my Department in 1999, schools were advised of their duties in this area and of the need to take positive measures to prevent and minimise the risk of violence within the school environment. In particular, the attention of schools was drawn to the need for effective school policies on school discipline and bullying. The circular advises schools that these policies should be reviewed on a regular basis and suggests that the early identification and resolution of weaknesses in school policies generally lessens the threat of violence in the school. The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While management authorities are not required to notify my Department of bullying cases in schools, my Department regularly receives telephone calls reporting alleged instances of bullying. Generally these calls are informal enquiries and officials of my Department offer advice and assistance. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, <Col N="750" /> but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. The National Educational Psychological Service is available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties. I have requested my officials to arrange a meeting in the near future with the group referred to by the Deputy, on a mutually suitable date.</P>

      <P>The objective of the guidance enhancement initiative is to develop innovative ways of enhancing guidance through promoting links between schools, business, voluntary and state agencies and increasing the uptake of science subjects. All second level schools were invited to submit proposals for an allocation of career guidance posts under the initiative. The posts were allocated in accordance with agreed criteria on the recommendations of a selection panel involving experts in the field of guidance and project management. 103 schools will benefit directly from the 50 posts allocated under the initiative. I have arranged to have a list of the names and locations of the successful applicant schools forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of my Department's free fees initiative, the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration at approved colleges. Eligibility under the initiative is subject to a number of conditions. For example, students who are repeating a year level <Col N="753" /> are generally not eligible for funding. It is the third level institutions which take decisions regarding eligibility under the free fees initiative, based on criteria issued by my Department. These institutions do not refer individual queries to my Department except, in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition in the criteria is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy. Where an institution has not extended the benefit of the free fees initiative to an individual student and the student is of the view that the free fees criteria have not been interpreted correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the institution itself, may in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on an issue from my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of the teaching posts at second level schools are filled on a permanent whole-time basis. According to records in my Department there are approximately 1,100 temporary wholetime teachers and 950 eligible part-time teachers employed in secondary schools. All of these teachers are paid in respect of the summer months. Vacancies in schools arising from career breaks, approved leave of absence or secondments and concessionary posts, which are allocated in excess of a school's normal quota of posts, may only be filled in a temporary or part-time capacity. In addition, in order to ensure that schools have the flexibility to meet the curricular needs of their students, particularly in minority subject areas, it is necessary for them to appoint temporary or part-time teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the eligible part-time teacher &ndash; EPT &ndash; scheme, EPTs who are fully qualified and have given satisfactory service are re-employed on a contract basis from year to year where the same teaching hours are required. Most teachers who are initially employed as EPTs subsequently apply for and are appointed to per<Col N="757" /> manent teaching posts in their subject area. They are entitled to incremental and pension credit for their qualified EPT service, together with recognition of this service for promotion purposes. The job security of temporary teachers is also related to the number and type of posts available. In this regard, the position at second level has significantly improved in recent years. Over 1,200 additional posts were created in the sector since the 1999-2000 school year. 200 new posts will be created this year and a further 200 posts will be created next year in accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The matter of employment for temporary teachers did not form part of the pay claim from the ASTI. A claim for the introduction of a salary scale for part-time teachers has been lodged at the Teachers' Conciliation Council. As claims before the Council are matters to be dealt with solely by the Council it would not be appropriate for me to make a statement on this matter at this time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the new programme Giving Children An Even Break, that I launched in January of this year, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will run over a three-year period and will cost some £26 million &ndash; 33,013,190. The new programme involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to over 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. All participating primary schools under the new programme will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of school supports for the pupils concerned over the three year period. A total of £3.6 million &ndash; 4.571,057 was allocated in grants to participating schools in respect of the 2000-01 school year. In April of this year, the 2,324 eligible primary schools were invited to participate in the new programme and benefit from the resources allocated, based on the level of concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of this number, 1,984 schools returned a form of undertaking to my Department by the deadline date of 4 May 2001 to indicate their willingness to participate in the new programme. These schools were allocated their full allocation of resources for the 2000-01 school year by June of this year. <Col N="758" /> The remaining 340 schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, were issued a further letter on 3 October 2001 reminding them to return the form of undertaking if they wished to participate in the new programme. Some of these schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have since returned the form of undertaking and will be allocated remaining resources in respect of the 2000-01 school year shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 January 1993, the institutes of technology, which were formerly known as regional technical colleges, were established on a statutory basis under the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992. Similarly, the Dublin Institute of Technology was established as a statutory body under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992. These Acts provide a comprehensive legal framework governing the operation of the institutes and contain a range of provisions which explicitly define the roles and responsibilities of the governing body, the director-president, the academic council, the vocational education committee and the Minister. The main policy objective of this legislation was to provide autonomy to the Institutes, as appropriate to third level institutions, within an overall policy, budgetary and quality assurance framework designed to ensure full accountability.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the legislation was amended by the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act, 1994, and the Dublin Institute of Technology (Amendment) Act, 1994, to provide, among other things, additional powers to the Minister to appoint a commission to carry out functions of the governing body, the chairman or the director-president where the Minister is satisfied that the affairs of the college are not being managed in an effective manner. I announced on 20 June 2001 that the Government has given its approval for the structural reform of my Department and has approved measures that include the bringing forward of legislation to extend the remit of the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate and fund the institutes of technology. The preparation of legislative proposals in this regard will necessarily involve a review of the existing legislation governing the institutes of technology.</P>

I expect <Col N="760" /> that the committee will report to me next month and I will arrange for the publication of their report as soon as practicable thereafter. I do not consider that the work of the committee and the publication of their report should delay consideration of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill. To do so would unreasonably delay the setting up of the redress scheme. This House will, in accordance with provisions now contained in the Bill, have an opportunity to debate the report and any regulations made arising from it.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the application for a maintenance grant to Wexford VEC by a person (details supplied) in County Wexford; the reason a back to work allowance paid to the applicant's father was included in the assessment of means; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: (a) the higher education grants scheme, (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grant schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Other than where the applicant is categorised as an independent mature student, the schemes provide that the means to be taken into account for the purpose of assessing eligibility under the scheme are those of the student, if any, and of the parents or guardians of the student, with the exception of certain specified social welfare and health board payments. The back to work allowance is not an excepted payment for purpose of determining reckonable income under the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the <Col N="761" /> relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he-she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he-she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his-her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grant schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grant schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support for disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Bill provides for a scheme of compensation in very particular circumstances. It applies to orphanages, industrial schools and reformatory schools. It is on these institutions that for most of the past three years attention has been focused because most allegations, and the most disturbing allegations, have been made about conditions in them up to the late 1960s. In addition, there is also the case that the Irish State generally and public institutions, in particular, carried a significant share of the responsibility, at least for a failure to detect abuse and to act. In the case of residential institutions of the kind referred to, publicly funded authorities had formal, and in most cases statutory responsibility, both for the placing of the children in the institutions and in regulating all aspects of the operation of the institutions. The State, through these public bodies, to a significant degree, replaced parents as the natural protector and care giver of the children concerned. This conferred on the State a special legal and moral responsibility for the welfare of those children. A similar responsibility did not apply in the case of children who continued to live in their homes and community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of the industrial schools, orphanages and other such institutions is also relevant to the decision to pay compensation from public funds to former residents of these. Unlike ordinary schools where children returned to the protection of their families, the institutions concerned had complete control over all aspects of the children's lives. Given the weakness and vulnerability of a child who has been deprived of parental care in such a situation, the authorities mandated in law to protect his or her interests have a particularly onerous responsibility. Failure on the part of those authorities can carry serious consequences for the children who have no other advocate. In the case of ordinary schools, public <Col N="764" /> authorities did not have this level of responsibility and had no authority to exercise it.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that abuse of any child, wherever it occurred, is not to be equally abhorred and the victims of such crimes should be assisted to recovery. For that reason the general range of initiatives taken by the Government in the past two years apply to all victims of abuse, wherever it occurred, other than family homes in the case of the commission. These include the setting up of the commission to inquire into child abuse, dedicated counselling services in all health board areas for victims of abuse and amendment to the Statute of Limitations. The change in the statute enabled victims of abuse to seek financial redress in the courts. The overall aim of these measures has been to assist those who still suffer from the trauma of abuse in childhood to recover, to establish responsibility for past abuse and to find better ways to safeguard children for the future.</P>
    <P>Finally, one of the functions laid down in the commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, requires the commission to advise the Government on the actions that may be taken to alleviate the damage suffered by persons who were abused in childhood. The Commission process is open to all people who suffered abuse in childhood, except where the abuse occurred in a family home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of post-primary education provision, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre. These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme. The catchment boundaries were determined following consultation with local educational interests and the intention was that certain primary schools would feed exclusively into each centre. A relatively small number of primary <Col N="768" /> schools are shared between two or more centres. There are no specific regulations governing the determination of catchment areas.</P>
      <P>For the majority of denominational primary schools, the parish boundaries effectively define the catchment area. However, these boundaries would not be relevant in the case of multi-denominational and all-Irish primary schools.</P>
      <P>The revision of catchment areas is addressed by my Department as the need arises. It is the practice in my Department to consult with local educational interests where any such adjustments are being contemplated. If the Deputy is aware of a particular area where such a revision would seem to be appropriate and provides me with the details, I will have the matter addressed immediately.</P>

    <P>The national educational psychological service is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding to primary and secondary schools on the basis of <i>per capita</i> grants with additional grants for caretakers and secretaries. Responsibility for the operation of Community Employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis, as the FÁS school-based Community Employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will <Col N="772" /> receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £100 &ndash; 126.98 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £60 &ndash; 76.18 &ndash; per pupil. The grant will be further increased to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 &ndash; 3,047.37 &ndash; to £4,800 &ndash; 6,094.74 &ndash; while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; to £40,000 &ndash; 50,789.52 &ndash; per annum.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund, which I introduced last year. With immediate effect, schools will receive an increase in the annual support grant from £20 &ndash; 25.40 &ndash; per pupil to £50 &ndash; 63.49 &ndash; per pupil, with a further increase to £70 &ndash; 88.88 &ndash; per pupil next September and to £78 &ndash; 99.04 &ndash; per pupil in January 2003. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
      <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for smaller schools will increase from £4,000 &ndash; 5,078.96 &ndash; to £15,600 &ndash; 19,807.91 &ndash; per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000 &ndash; 12,697.38 &ndash; to £39,000 &ndash; 49,519.79 &ndash; over this school year and the next. In the case of schools receiving grants of £55 &ndash; 69.84 &ndash; per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to a maximum of £19,250 &ndash; 24,442.46 &ndash; per school, the annual grant of £78 &ndash; 99.04 &ndash; per pupil under the services support fund will bring the combined total for a 500 pupil school to £58,250 &ndash; 73,962.24.</P>
      <P>My Department has now issued circulars to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. The payment of the increases concerned to schools will be made in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussions that took place in connection with the transfer of funding, I agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the with<Col N="773" /> drawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools. I am aware that FÁS has issued guidelines to its regional offices that reflect the agreement that I have referred to above.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently conducting a thorough review of school provision in the Lucan area. As part of this review, the options for meeting the primary school accommodation needs of the area, by providing temporary accommodation in the short-term and extensions or new schools in the medium to long-term, are under active consideration. Discussions will be held, also, between officials of the planning and building unit and the principals of the four postprimary schools in Lucan to ascertain their views on developments in the area.</P>
      <P>Extensions to two of the post-primary schools in Lucan are at an advanced stage of architectural planning. The position in regard to the building project at St. Joseph's College, Lucan, is that stage 3, developed sketch scheme, has been cleared by my Department and a stage 4-5, detail design-bill of quantities, submission is awaited from the school. The position regarding the building project at Coláiste Phádraig, Lucan, is that my Department has approved stage 4-5, detail design-bill of quantities, for the extension.

      <P>My Department has received an application for grant-aid towards the cost of a building project at St. Claire's special school, Ennis. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million &ndash; 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day.</P>
      <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming estimates.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that this school applied for two additional teaching posts on developing grounds <Col N="776" /> for the school year 2001-02, based on a projected increase in enrolment of more than 86 pupils between 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2001.</P>
    <P>The two additional teaching posts were granted on a provisional basis only, subject to the projected enrolment been attained on 30 September. One post has since been sanctioned on a permanent basis but, unfortunately, the enrolment required for the second post was not achieved on 30 September.</P>

      <P>The report entitled A Review of the Operation of VEC Outdoor Education Centres in Ireland, known as the Rice report, was presented to my predecessor on 12 January 1999.</P>
      <P>The report made a series of recommendations on all aspects of the operation of outdoor education centres. It identified the regularisation of the position of employees in the centres as being of particular importance. Towards that end officials of my Department are in negotiation with various representatives of the staff of outdoor education centres regarding their status, salary, terms and conditions of employment. The regularisation of the staffing position within the centres will represent a major improvement in the operation of the centres.</P>
      <P>This regularisation of staffing, may however, have significant cost implications for the centres and any new arrangements agreed will be relevant in determining my Department's future budgetary planning and funding strategy for VEC outdoor education centres. It is in this context that consideration of other recommendations of the Rice report, particularly those relating to the expansion of the network of VEC outdoor education centres, will be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 821 and 822 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding to primary and second level schools on the basis of per capita grants with additional grants towards ancillary services such as caretaking and secretarial. Responsibility for the operation of Community Employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based Community Employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash;</P>
      <P>40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £100 &ndash; 126.98 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £60 &ndash; 76.18 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 &ndash; 3,047.37 &ndash; to £4,800 &ndash; 6,094.74 &ndash; while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; to £40,000  &ndash; 50,789.52 &ndash; per annum.</P>
      <P>At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20 &ndash; 25.40 &ndash; per pupil to £50 &ndash; 63.49 &ndash; per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70 &ndash; 88.88 &ndash; per pupil next September and to £78 &ndash; 99.04 &ndash; per pupil in January 2003. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to per capita grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. These increases are in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000 &ndash; 5,078.96 &ndash; to <Col N="778" /> £15,600 &ndash; 19,807.91 &ndash; per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000 &ndash; 12,697.38 &ndash; to £39,000 &ndash; 49,519.79 &ndash; over this school year and the next. In the case of second level schools receiving grants of £55 &ndash; 69.84 &ndash; per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to a maximum of £19,250 &ndash; 24,442.46 &ndash; per school, the annual grant of £78 &ndash; 99.04 &ndash; under the services support fund will bring the combined total for a 500 pupil school to £58,250 &ndash; 73,962.24 &ndash; per year.</P>
    <P>My Department has received representations from schools, including schools in the Cork area, inquiring about the new arrangements that will be put on place as the CE schemes are phased out. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has issued circulars to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. It is intended that payments will issue to schools shortly.</P>
    <P>However, I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash; 2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that took place in connection with the transfer of funding, I agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools. I am aware that FÁS has issued guidelines to its regional offices that reflect the agreement that I have referred to above.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local <Col N="779" /> Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he-she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he-she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his-her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>

    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>A psychologist who has recently joined NEPS has now been assigned to County Mayo. When he has completed his induction programme, it will be possible to offer the NEPS service to additional schools in County Mayo.

    <P>The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently conducting a recruitment <Col N="783" /> competition for NEPS on behalf of my Department. NEPS will have attained its final staffing complement of 200 psychologists by the end of next year and it will then be possible to offer a psychological service to all schools in the country. I have been concerned for some time about the needs of children in schools who do not yet have access to the psychological service provided by NEPS. I have therefore made funding available to NEPS to allow such schools to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners.

      <P>The Education Act, 1998 makes provision for the establishment of student councils in post-primary schools. The function of a student council is to promote the interests of the school and the involvement of students in the affairs of the school in co-operation with the board of management, parents and teachers. A student council can play an integral and important role in the school by providing a positive environment where students can explore issues and undertake initiatives of benefit to the school community and wider society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Student councils are an opportunity for students to contribute to the development of their school and, while student councils have already been established in several schools, it is my wish that as many post-primary schools and students as possible avail of this opportunity. Accordingly, <Col N="786" /> in line with the provisions of the Act, I have asked my Department to prepare guidelines to assist boards of management in drawing up appropriate rules for the establishment of a student council having regard to the particular needs and circumstances of the school. Following recent consultations with the partners in education, the guidelines are now at an advanced stage of preparation and I expect to be in a position to issue them to schools in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students. The group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of claimants of long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant candidates must meet the following conditions. He, or she, must qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants and total reckonable income, in the tax year to 5 April 2001, must not exceed £7,400. In the case of independent mature applicants, as at 1 April 2001, the applicant's spouse or partner must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments and be in receipt of full-rate qualified adult allowance, or similar entitlement, in respect of the applicant, or the applicant, him or herself, must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments. In the case of all other applicants, as at 1 April 2001, the applicant's parent(s) or guardian(s) must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments which includes child dependant allowance in respect of the applicant or one of the designated programmes.</P>
      <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation. The three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level students attending approved courses in approved third level institutions funded by my Department are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, <Col N="789" /> 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the fund's provision from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>The Education Act, 1998, was signed in to law on 23 December 1998. It provides, for the first time, a statutory framework for Irish education at primary and post-primary levels. It was commenced in three parts. The first commencement order was made on 5 February 1999, the second on 23 December 1999 and the third and final commencement order was made on 22 December 2000. All sections of the Act have now been commenced.</P>

My Department is preparing a second report on the implementation of the Act and this will be laid before each House shortly.

      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically, this can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with schools, involving my Department's inspectorate, to assist in the re-instatement of the pupil in the school, or alternatively, his or her placement in another school. In more difficult situations the national educational psychological service is available to assess pupils, in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these measures provide protection for students, I have, in addition, brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, to address general issues related to attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a countrywide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second-level schools. The Act requires schools to report suspensions that last at least six days to their local educational welfare officer. Schools will also be required to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any <Col N="792" /> student. In such instances, the role of the educational welfare officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to try and identify a mutually agreeable solution to provide for the education of the student concerned. The automatic involvement of the officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility <Col N="795" /> for the operation of community employment  &ndash; CE &ndash; schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash;  per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash;  in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 &ndash; 50.79 per pupil per annum to £100 &ndash; 101.58 per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £60  &ndash; 76.18 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 &ndash; 3,047.37 &ndash;  to £4,800 &ndash; 6,094.74 &ndash; while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; to £40,000 &ndash; 50,789.52 &ndash; per annum.</P>
      <P>Schools which already have the services of a full-time secretary or caretaker employed under my Department's 1978-79 scheme are not eligible for additional funding towards ancillary services as outlined above as the total cost of these posts is met by my Department. However, schools that share the services of a secretary or caretaker under the above scheme are being written to by my Department with proposals to allocate the services of the shared secretary or caretaker to one school and to assist the other school by means of the ancillary services grant.</P>
      <P>At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20 &ndash; 25.40 &ndash; per pupil to £50 &ndash; 63.49 &ndash; per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70 &ndash; 88.88 &ndash; per pupil next September. These increases are in addition to the £55 &ndash; 69.84 &ndash; per pupil at present provided to schools for secretaries and caretakers where these are not provided under separate schemes. This element of £55 &ndash; 69.84 &ndash; is subject to a ceiling of £19,250 &ndash; 24,442.46 &ndash; per school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000 &ndash; 5,078.96 &ndash; to £14,000 &ndash; 17,776.33 &ndash; per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000 &ndash; 12,697.38 &ndash; to £35,000 &ndash; 44,440.83 &ndash;  each year. In the case of second level schools already <Col N="796" /> receiving £55 &ndash; 69.84 &ndash;  per pupil for secretaries and caretakers they will, under this new scheme, also receive £70 &ndash; 88.88 &ndash; per pupil bringing their combined total for a 500 pupil school to £54,250 &ndash; 68,883.30 &ndash; per year.</P>
    <P>My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash;  2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the consultants' recommendations.</P>
    <P>I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>I have received the letter to which the Deputy refers. I am satisfied that my Department did not act in an arbitrary way in relation to the proposed establishment of the pre-school in question. This matter was the subject of a number of discussions involving officials of my Department and the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can readily understand the concerns which have now been raised by the school authorities in relation to some of the subsequent developments outlined in the letter to which the Deputy refers. Indeed, I can assure the Deputy that the developments in question were neither notified to nor approved of by my Department. Throughout my Department's dealings with the representatives of the pre-school project, the focus of the discussions was solely on the development of a pre-school facility. At no stage did my Department agree to the development of a facility to cater for <Col N="799" /> children beyond pre-school, and at no stage in the discussions was any reference made to the provision of night classes at the facility. My Department had no knowledge of any such proposal and did not sanction any such development. Indeed, it would be a matter for the authorities at St. Joseph's to consider whether they wished to facilitate any such development. My Department has already notified the authorities at St. Joseph's of its position in relation to the above matters. The representatives of the pre-school project are being similarly advised.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million  &ndash; 470.4 million &ndash;  which is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including Gainstown national school, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming Estimates.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements are in place for the recognition in this State of teachers who are recognised teachers in another member state of the EU and to whom the terms of Council Directive 89/48/EEC apply. Statutory Instrument 1/91, by which Council Directive 89/48/EEC on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications was implemented, stipulates that the Minister for Education and Science is the designated authority for the recognition of teachers in primary, community, comprehensive and vocational schools, and that the registration council, with the approval of the Minister, is the designated authority in the case of teachers in voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>At post primary level, a teacher who is recognised as a fully qualified teacher in a member state of the EU may apply to my Department for similar recognition in this State. Full recognition is granted to such applicants where the appropriate authority is satisfied that the qualifications held by the applicant are of an equivalent standard to those required for teaching in this State. Where a substantial shortfall in the education and training of the applicant is identified, provisional recognition may be granted on the applicant undertaking to make good the shortfall within the required time limits by means of either passing an aptitude test or completing an adaptation period. At post-primary level there were 74 recorded applications under the directive referred to in 1998, 95 in 1999 and 117 in 2000. All were recognised either provisionally or in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level, teachers are class teachers, rather than subject specialists, and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. In order to be fully recognised to teach at primary level in this country, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and pos<Col N="803" /> sess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification can usually be achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the postgraduate conversion courses, or by a primary teacher trained abroad achieving the necessary level of competence in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Primary teachers trained in another member state of the European Union, including the United Kingdom, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period of provisional recognition these teachers are remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers. The period of provisional recognition was extended from three to five years in order to allow such teachers adequate time to prepare for and pass the Irish language examination and also in response to the ongoing teacher supply issue at primary level.</P>
    <P>However teachers from abroad who qualified as second level teachers in their country of origin and who have not undertaken an appropriate conversion course in primary teacher training are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools. This is in line with the situation that pertains in relation to qualified second level teachers who trained in this State, and who have not undergone a post-graduate conversion course to qualify as a primary teacher. Such teachers are not recognised to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools. Details of the number of applicants from abroad who have applied for recognition as primary teachers within the last three years are not readily to hand. However I have asked my officials to collate the information requested by the Deputy and to send it directly to him as soon as it is available.</P>
