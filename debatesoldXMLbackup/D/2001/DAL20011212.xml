      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Naughten. I call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent importance, namely, in light of the inadequate funding provided in budget 2002 to Vantastic Limited, over 400 people with disabilities in the Dublin area will be denied a public transport service from next spring, which is a U-turn on a commitment given by the Government earlier this year.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise, under Standing Order 31, the urgent matter of the Irish Government being taken to court for its failure to comply with various environmental directives, in particular the landfill directive, Articles 226 and 228, which require the restoration of sites where illegal dumps have been discovered, and the need to plan financially and logistically for compliance with this law.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point of order. Before the Taoiseach announces the Order of Business, will he take this opportunity to correct the record? Yesterday, in relation to questions about Mr. Justice Flood, he stated: &ldquo;It is not a question of better answers, but of facts. Last summer Mr. Justice Flood asked for the appointment of two additional judges&rdquo;. I do not doubt that someone in his office will have drawn to the Taoiseach's attention that this statement was incorrect and he may wish to correct the record. Mr. Justice Flood actually stated:</P>
      <P>The Tribunal is desirous that paragraph 3 of the Instrument be amended by providing for the nomination of two further persons to be Members of the Tribunal to the intent that the Tribunal shall cease to be a Tribunal comprising of a Sole Member and shall become a three Member Tribunal under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Feargus Flood and further by the nomination of a further person to sit with the Tribunal to hear evidence with a view to such person being available to become a Member of the Tribunal in the event that any existing Member of the Tribunal, for any reason, is unable to continue to act.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My note from the Attorney General indicates that Mr. Justice Flood had asked for the appointment of two additional judges and a substitute alternate. The note makes it clear that the alternate could be someone other than a judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is probably aware that the users of the Vantastic service have begun what has become an annual protest at the gates of Leinster House to highlight the inadequate funding to keep the service going. The Taoiseach may not know that it is the commitment of the people in wheelchairs and their supporters to stay outside Leinster House indefinitely. They were there right through last night in very cold conditions. Will the Taoiseach intervene in this matter. This service changes enormously the lives of persons who are disabled, especially those in wheelchairs. It allows them to go to work and gives them the mobility that they lack. It is a great service.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question put down in my name, the only commitment given by the Government was to increase the grant given to this service to match inflation. That is not sufficient. There is a very serious situation here. Disabled people in wheelchairs were outside this House last night in very cold conditions and they intend to stay outside this House right through Christmas. The Taoiseach should intervene at this stage so that the service can continue. On current funding, it will close at the end of February. We cannot stand over that and this House should unite to ensure that the service continues. The amount of money requested is modest given the total budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this modest request. Does the Taoiseach not agree that, at a time when his Government can reduce employers PRSI contributions by the massive sum of 330 million, it is quite possible from the extensive resources available to this administration to provide sufficient funds to ensure that people with disability can live independently? It is through no fault of their own that they have a physical disability which impairs their potential and opportunity. All they ask is to have the same mobility in effective terms <Col N="804" /> that the rest of us enjoy because of our able-bodied status. The limited funds required are available to this Government in abundance. A clear signal should be given by the Taoiseach that the necessary additional sums, above and beyond the rate of inflation, will be made available to this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no argument with what Deputies have said. This matter was brought to my attention yesterday. Vantastic provides targeted transport for 400 people with disabilities funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I was informed that the service received £350,000 in the year 2000, £350,000 in 2001 and that £370,000 has been provided for the forthcoming year. There is no question of discontinuing that funding. I have since been informed that Vantastic is looking for additional cover. I am not certain what that cover is but I will have the matter looked at. However, I emphasise that there is no question of discontinuing the funding that has been in place for the past two years. If some other matter arises, I will ask the disability equality unit to examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that because this is such a good service, because it changes the lives of persons with disability to such a degree, and in particular because it allows them to participate in the world of work, the service has expanded and is expanding? The expanded service cannot be covered with a grant of £370,000. The grant aid will run out sometime in late February or early March. It must be increased. An indexation increase is not sufficient. The service needs in excess of £1 million to cover the costs for one year of providing the service they do now. That is not huge money in relation to the budget. The Taoiseach should get the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with this as a matter of urgency rather than being dragged into agreeing something on Christmas eve because of the hardship experienced by those on protest outside the gates of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at this service. It provides transport for 400 people with disabilities. I understand from the note from the Union of Students of Ireland that Vantastic intends to provide that service for the year ahead also. I do not know how costs have risen so much if they are providing the same service. However, I will have the matter looked at. There seemed to be a view in one of the notes I received last night that funding was to be withdrawn from the service. That is not the case but I will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Wallace, to examine the matter.</P>

      <P>Late last night or early this morning, Members received a very short Bill, the Referendum Bill, 2001, which proposes a change to the way in which referenda are conducted in this State. This House has finished the debate on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 &ndash; the so-called abortion Bill. There was a Second Stage debate on the Bill in the Seanad last week where the leader of the Progressive Democrats, who is still in partnership in Government and has considerable authority as Tánaiste, indicated that there may not be a referendum on the Bill and on the abortion issue. In the light of the authoritative statements made by a senior member of the Coalition Government, will the Taoiseach indicate to the House if it is the Government decision to proceed with the abortion referendum? If so, has a date been fixed for that abortion referendum?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the group which used to be known as Youth Defence and is now campaigning on the referendum as the Mother and Child group, intend to put up billboards around the country aimed personally at the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children. I assure the Taoiseach that I deplore this type of campaigning, as should all Deputies in the House. Issues like this should not be personalised. My party wants to continue this debate by keeping hysteria out.</P>

      <P>The answer to Deputy Quinn's question is, yes. In reply to his next question, the Government has not fixed a date for the referendum. That will be discussed in the New Year. The small legislative changes are totally in line with the all-party Oireachtas committee report, and I believe the reference is on page 25. I thank Deputy Noonan for his comments which I appreciate. We can have our arguments and debates, and we have had a lengthy debate on this issue, but I am well able to take the ridicule of this group in their costly campaign. However, it is not the way to make a point.</P>

      <P>It is a great pleasure to speak on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 2001, this morning. It is an occasion to applaud the great work of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. When the tenure of the Minister is looked at in historical terms, I believe he will be seen as the greatest Minister for Social Welfare this country has ever seen. He has overseen the greatest development in the elimination of poverty since the foundation of the State. He has recognised the need for funding the pensions of our senior citizens, not only during the tenure of this Government but also in the future beyond 2025, by setting up the national pension reserve, which the NTMA manages. He has also arranged for 1% of GNP to be set aside each year in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> Deputy Dermot Ahern is part of the successful Government led by Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach, which forms the most competent management team ever seen in Government in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Having gone around the constituency of Dublin South Central and attended the various meetings in Walkinstown, Crumlin, Ballyfermot and the south-west inner city over the last weekend, I am more confident that this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government will return to office after the next election.</P>
    <P>Labour Party Members in their contributions to the debate on the budget have concentrated on newspaper clipping and the remarks of so-called objective economic assessors. I suggest that the Labour Party is living in a time warp. There was a time when people took on board the musings of the commentators. They have since learned that, despite the commentators, this Government can and will continue to manage the economy in a manner which is in the best interests of the people in both the short and the long term. From my discussions with hundreds of constituents over the past week, I can inform the House that the people acknowledge this and will show their confidence in the Government next April or May by returning this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government for another five years.</P>
    <P>Aspiring Ministers in the Labour ranks may just cool it. Those may-be Ministers, who do not know whether they would accept a position in Government in the middle of next year, should not concern themselves or worry unduly about the matter. I can assure them that the question will not arise. Rather than accepting the writings of the commentators and musing philosophically about the budget, they would be better to go out among the people and find out what their priorities are and respond positively to them as this Government has done.</P>
    <P>From my perspective and that of Fianna Fáil colleagues to whom I have spoken, there is no wish on our part to be contaminated by Labour Party policies, which in the recent past have given rises to our senior citizens of £1.80, £2.20 and £3 against this Government's rise of £38 over the five years we have been in office. The Labour Party will get its answer when the ballot boxes are opened next year.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Get real,&rdquo; they will tell us. They can keep their ideologies and philosophical rants. They can bluster on RTE but they will not bluster the people. The Labour Party has some able people, some of whom have missed their true vocations. They should be in theatre. The Labour Party offers light relief at times and cerebral gobbledygook at other times. Some Labour Party Members will be returned at the next election but their number will be smaller than at present. <Col N="816" /> Labour Party Members who aspire to Mercedes cars, drivers and ministerial office have a good ten years ahead of them on the Opposition benches and their numbers will be much fewer. That is the wish of the electorate.</P>
      <P>I thank the Government on behalf of the voters of Dublin South Central for the marvellous increases not just in this budget but during all this Government's years in office. Those people have told me that they will ensure the Fianna FáilProgressive Democrat Government is returned to office at the next election to continue its magnificent work.</P>

      <P>This year's budget proposes many increases. Yesterday at lunch time I met a woman who was very grateful for the £10 per week increase in the old age pension. She had been expecting an increase between £2 and £3. The fact that our senior citizens think that way is a sad legacy of the Labour Party, which gave increases of that order when last in Government, dear oh dear. A £20 per week increase in payment for a senior citizen couple was beyond the wildest dreams of some of the people I met but it is now a reality.</P>
      <P>The child benefit rate for four children is now £417 per month. When the Government is returned to office next year increases of a similar nature can be expected, as was promised not in this year's budget but a year ago.</P>
      <P>I give credit to Deputy De Rossa for his work on child benefit when he was Minister for Social Welfare. It is not unexpected that he deserted a sinking ship, the Labour Party, as he is a pragmatist, a species alien to the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>We all appreciate the work done by Deputy Ahern as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs over the last five years. Nobody appreciates it more than the people who depend on him and his Department for the benefits they need, whether it is an old age pension, unemployment payment or so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand why this Bill arouses envy on the Opposition benches. When we spoke about a <Col N="817" /> £100 per week non-contributory old age pension in 1997 we were told it was an unrealistic dream but since then the dream has been fulfilled. Not alone did we achieve a £100 pension, but after this budget the pension rate is £105.53 for a non-contributory pension and approximately £116 for a contributory pension. The various benefits and free schemes all show this is a caring Government when it comes to older people and those who depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The changes in child benefit are also welcome. In 1997 the rate for the first and second child was £29 while the rate for the third and subsequent children was £34. The monthly rate now for one child is 117, for two children is 235 and for four children it is 529.80. Those increases prove that the Government has taken to heart the need to help children and the parents of young families. The increases given are totally warranted and are among the most progressive decisions taken by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>People said the Government would not last a week at the start of its term. Then people said it would not last two years and when it reached two years they said it would not last three. It has run its full term and when people are asked to make a decision next May, despite Deputy Browne's hopes which will be dashed again as they have been several times in the past&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the Government will be returned to office. There is no doubt about that. It has been a caring Government and has looked after those in need of care.</P>
      <P>The changes for carers are also welcome. We once had a carer's allowance which was means tested and if one had over £70 per week in means in 1997 one was excluded. Now a couple can have over £300 per week income allowance and still be entitled to full carer's benefit. We know the enormous amount of work done by carers in looking after those who are house bound handicapped and so on. We also understand however that no matter what people may get, it is no compensation for the loss they sustain. Everyone accepts that one can never make a monetary contribution sufficient to deal with the problems of disability in a home.</P>
      <P>In 1996-97 the widow's pension was £64.50. Under the new scheme proposed by the Minister it will rise to £97.11 or 123 for those under 66. We all accept that widows have often been forgotten by Governments but the Minister has moved to close the gap and make the situation more equitable by helping those in need. We as Members deal with the public and the technical problems with the social welfare code that we have found have now been dealt with. Many social welfare anomalies have been cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much comment about the money taken from the social welfare fund to balance the budget. Everyone accepts the fund was <Col N="818" /> in surplus and it would have been foolish not to use it for the benefit of those in need of social welfare. It is accepted by all parties that if there was a crisis and the money needed to be used for those in receipt of social welfare benefits, then the fund should be used. It has been used and nobody should make an apology for it.</P>

        <b>: </b>The Minister for Finance talked about writing a second book when he made his Budget Statement. This is the final chapter in my great odyssey through the Oireachtas and I expect to publish my biography after my speech. There is probably nobody who will buy it but that makes no great difference.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has left the Chamber, as I wanted him to answer a question or two. Perhaps the Minister of State will make sure he answers the questions when he replies. Last evening, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs said:</P>
      <P>I am bringing forward the budget increases in weekly rates of payment to 1 January. This means that in 2002 social welfare clients will be paid their increase for the full 52 weeks of the year compared to 29 weeks when we came into office in 1997.</P>
      <P>That is a false statement, which I would call a lie if I was allowed to use the word. The Minister is playing with figures that if an increase in May was followed by an increase the following May, 52 weeks would have passed. The Minister misused the English language by talking about an increase of only 29 weeks in 1997. I was prepared to give way to the Minister to explain the falsehood and I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to correct the statement. A decent Fianna Fáil backbencher repeated the same rubbish last evening so I suppose it is circulating from that party's press office. Will the Government clarify its allegation that an increase in 1997 was for only 29 weeks?</P>

        <b>: </b>I regret that this matter has not been resolved. Fritz Kreisler was the greatest violinist of all time, but he cannot compare to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has repeated the same tune time and time again. In his speech last night, the Minister compared the percentage social welfare increases of this Government and its predecessor, but he forgot that while this Government has been in office for five years, the Rainbow Government lasted just over two years. It is time that such a senior Minister stopped repeating himself as he is not comparing like with like. While it is marvellous to hear Government backbenchers saying that Deputy Dermot Ahern is a wonderful Minister, he was lucky to have been in office at a time of budget surpluses. The Government came into power at a good time in contrast to the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who took over when inflation was 24%.</P>

        <b>: </b>A distinction has been made in recent years between widows over the age of 66 and widows under that age. I have asked the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to explain why widows over 66 years have been given an increase of £12, while those under that age have been given £8. Why is it imagined that a widow aged 60 has fewer expenses than a widow aged 70? If there are surplus social welfare funds, they should be used to give increases to widows under the age of 66. What is the point of having an insurance fund, built up from the contributions of taxpayers, if it is not used for pension increases? I would like the Government to explain the distinction between widows of different ages because although younger widows may benefit from children's allowances, it could be argued that they face greater difficulties as a result of costs such as heating and providing for children. The children of a widow aged 70 may help her out, but younger widows have to look after their children. I fail to understand the philosophy which considers that younger widows should get less money. If the fund is still in surplus next year, a Fine Gael Government will look after widows under the age of 66.</P>

        <b>: </b>I admit that I would much prefer to talk though the Chair. Yesterday I raised the matter of the summer scheme for students, for which the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is responsible. I understand the Union of Students in Ireland was protesting outside Leinster House yesterday, but I did not see the protest as I was here too early. Students work under this scheme to earn money in preparation for their return to college, but the Minister could only guarantee me yesterday that he would do his best to pay them before Christmas. The Minister's photograph appears in many newspapers at public expense in an attempt to get re-elected. God be with the days when Ministers did their jobs and advertisements were posted by civil servants. The Minister looks after his publicity, but ignores the difficulties in Donegal that have meant that many students have not been paid. Is the strike continuing in Donegal?

      <P>The Government claims to have an overall strategy for tackling poverty and I applaud any such efforts. The increases in social welfare payments are generous to some extent, but they have many flaws. One of the main problems faced by some of those dependent on social welfare payments is that they do not qualify for a medical card. It is important to examine such cases.</P>
      <P>People on low incomes face significant difficulties. Those just above the threshold will have difficulty obtaining a medical card. Some of those in receipt of social welfare payments or on low incomes do not qualify for a medical card. It costs £25 to see a doctor and a visit to a chemist may cost £50. When these figures are subtracted from a low income it makes life very difficult for those involved.</P>
      <P>A single person living alone on £120 or £130 per week does not qualify for a medical card. The Government should review such cases. This is not the sole responsibility of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as it also concerns the Department of Health and Children. However, such situations should be re-examined as part of an overall social welfare package. I appeal to the Minister of State to discuss the matter with senior officials in these two Departments to see if this issue can be resolved. The threshold is rigidly enforced so those just above it are deprived of medical cards and, therefore, cannot afford to visit a doctor.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the fuel scheme should operate for the full year. I welcome the existing period over which it operates, but there is a need to extend it to 12 months. One can experience bad weather at any time of the year in Ireland. One can also experience good weather in December, as is the case today. However, August can be cold and wet, so the scheme should be extended to operate for the full year.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of how the Minister of State may view it, the attack on the social welfare fund is serious. The decision to take money from the fund will have repercussions. The Minister of State may claim that I am prophesying gloom and doom, but that is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the last election Fianna Fáil was in favour of retaining the social welfare fund. This fund <Col N="824" /> was established to provide for pensions and other social welfare entitlements and it is important that it is retained. The fund has been attacked to pay for current spending, something for which it was never intended. This is a smash and grab raid.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Wade and Michael Ahern.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Government for providing outstanding increases for the less well off. In budget 2002, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, provided for the most vulnerable in our society. This year's budget will provide for those who need help most, with increases in child benefit, pensions and welfare payments from January 2002. Increases in social welfare will now be payable more than five months earlier than when the Government came to office. I compliment the Government and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on this measure.</P>
      <P>The £850 million additional social welfare spending announced in the budget equals last year's increases and means across the board increases for all social welfare recipients. These increases mean that despite a more difficult economic situation, the less well off will fare best. The total social welfare budget next year will be more than £7.4 billion.</P>
      <P>The increases announced in this year's budget, particularly those for older people, carers and the unemployed, represent further steps towards reducing poverty and disadvantage. Families will benefit greatly from this budget. For the second successive year child benefit has increased by £25 per month for the first and second children and by £30 for the third and subsequent children. This increase brings a monthly payment for the first and second children to £92.62 and for the third and subsequent children to £116. A family of three children will now receive £301.24, compared with £221 at present, an increase of £80 per month or 36%. Child benefit has tripled since the Government came to office. In 1997, the rainbow coalition's Minister for Social Welfare, the famous socialist, Deputy De Rossa, gave an increase of £1, compared to £25 this year and last year. The back to school clothing and footwear allowance has also been increased. From next year 70,000 children aged 12 and over will benefit from an increase in the payment rate, which has been raised to £94 per child. By easing the means test, another 8,000 children will be eligible for inclusion in this scheme. An increase in the income threshold for family income supplement will bring the average payment to £59 per family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elderly will also gain significantly. The full personal rate of old age, retirement and invalidity pensions is to be raised by a minimum of £10 per week. This brings the old age contributory pension to £116 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to more than £105 per week. These increases mark an increase of almost 50% in those pensions over the past five budgets. These amounts also exceed the Government's commitment on entering office to raise old age pensions beyond the £100 mark. The increases <Col N="826" /> are well ahead of inflation and will mean a real improvement in the living standards of the elderly. The fuel allowance is being increased by £2.09 per week from next month. This is the first increase in this allowance since 1985 although the number of months covered by the scheme was increased last year and the scheme now operates from October to mid-April. The free electricity allowance gives an extra 300 free units, to bring the allowance up to 1,800 units and the qualification criteria for the free telephone allowance is to be relaxed. There will be further improvement in tax relief for the elderly. Income tax exemption limits have substantially increased in the past four budgets. It is only right that the Government has rewarded the older generation for their sacrifices, work and contribution to making the Irish economy what it is today.</P>
    <P>Those aged over 66 on the widow's contributory pension will receive an increase of £12, bringing the payment to £114 per week. The widowed parent grant will be doubled to £1,970.</P>
    <P>For those who provide care in our society there are also improvements. There will be a further easing of the income disregard for the carer's allowance. This will benefit 3,400 new carers and 2,300 existing carers. The annual respite care grant will increase to £500 annually.</P>
    <P>This Government has done more than any other in the history of the State to support the disadvantaged and to promote social inclusion. The budget continues this trend and provides further steps towards reducing the level of poverty and disadvantage in our society. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the marvellous work he has done for the elderly and the less well off in the past five years.</P>

      <P>Deputies from Fine Gael and the Labour Party often tell us how much they care for older people and the less well off. Later today however, unless they get some sense, they will be whipped into the Níl lobby to vote against almost £850 million worth of social welfare improvements. They will vote against the £10 increase in the old age pension and the £25 a month rise in child benefit and this weekend they will return to their clinics and expect their constituents to believe them when they tell them they want to make things better for older people and the less well off. Last week Fine Gael and the Labour Party opposed the budget, which took 68,000 low income earners out of the tax net. In the past five budgets they have opposed the measures which have taken 380,000 taxpayers out of the tax net, and with straight faces they tell us they care about the less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> We all remember Fine Gael and Labour in government and how little they did in the area of social welfare. Over the three budgets of the rainbow Government the old age pension was increased by an average of only £2.33 per year. That is no way to treat the older people who built up Ireland up from economic ruin. As recently as the autumn of 1986, after a lengthy period of Fine Gael and Labour coalition, we had the highest debt per head on the planet. In the autumn of 1986, the year after Live Aid, Ireland had a higher debt per head than Ethiopia or Sudan. How many of the people who worked so hard to pull us out of economic ruin then and in the years before, are now in receipt of old age pension? These people are entitled to receive increases. We now have a Government that will treat them with respect and the old age contributory pension will soon stand at £116 per week.</P>
    <P>When the rainbow Government was put out of office in 1997, the child benefit rate stood at £30 per month for the first and second child and £39 for the third and subsequent children. Thanks to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, it will soon be £92.60 for the first child and £116 for the third and subsequent children. The Government has tripled the child benefit rates left behind by the rainbow coalition.</P>
    <P>We have also brought forward and increased the weekly rates of social welfare payments to 1 January. This means that next year, most people on social welfare payments will receive their increased payments from 1 January. Some 210,000 people, including widows, widowers, one parent families and invalidity pensioners will receive a lump sum payment for the first six weeks of the year on 14 February. Under the rainbow Government, the miserable increases in social welfare payments were available for only 29 weeks per year. That is no way to treat our less well off.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael social welfare pre-budget submission proposed a £10.90 increase for widows and widowers. The Government is delivering £12. Even in opposition, when it does not have to balance the books, it could not match that. On the basis of its record in Government and more recently, measures such as special increases of £9.56 for those on the lowest rates of supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance would never have come from the party opposite. These are the kind of progressive social welfare policies that this country has been crying out for. Members of the Opposition have referred to the days of Brian Ború but I do not think any of us can remember back that far. There are many people however who can remember the days of an interparty Government when the old-age pension was 10 shillings a week and that Government took one shilling off it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>This was supported by the Labour Party who, at the time, hung their heads in shame. If one recalls those days it is well to remember what members of the Opposition did when they had their opportunity to run the country. The people who represented the party in those days did not mix with the ordinary working class. In the mid 1990s when the rainbow coalition was in Government and the money was there, they did not spend it on the elderly or the less well off. This is a caring Government which will continue to look after the underprivileged after it is returned to power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to speak on the Social Welfare Bill, 2001. In line with social welfare Bills of recent years, the Government has continued to improve the lot of those for whom the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has a responsibility of care. Having heard contributions from Members opposite and particularly from Deputy Hayes, the Fine Gael spokesperson, I wonder whether I am in the wrong House or the wrong planet. Perhaps Deputy Hayes is on the wrong planet. He does not seem to recognise what has been achieved by recent budgets.</P>
      <P>The Deputy started his budget contribution criticising the Government for not giving significant increases to the lowest paid, specifically the increase in short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare benefit. This has been increased to £93.56 per week but Deputy Hayes said it was not acceptable. In their recent document Fine Gael, and Deputy Hayes in particular, was looking for a £94 increase &ndash; just 44p higher than what was given. The Deputy went on to criticise the increase for widows yet his proposal was for an increase of £10.90 per week while the Minister for Finance has announced an increase of £12. Where is Deputy Hayes coming from?</P>
      <P>The Deputy also accused the Minister for Finance yesterday of breaking the promises Fianna Fáil made in 1997 to continue with the prudent management of the economy. Referring to the social insurance fund, which has been raised every time a member of the Opposition speaks, he said it should not be used for any purpose other than paying social welfare benefits. When Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance and the fund was in deficit he saw no problem using it to pay benefits other than entitlements under contributions.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the social insurance fund is in surplus &ndash; there is money there to be used for the people. Is the Opposition against a £10 increase in social welfare, a £20 increase for pensioner couples, a £12 special increase for widows and widowers and so on? Would they argue against those increases being made by using money that is sitting in a fund? Are they suggesting we borrow instead? When one borrows, one must repay with interest and that will not benefit the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement of the budget shocked every member of the Opposition. They did not <Col N="829" /> know what had happened and went into a state of panic. They reacted irrationally and have continued to do so. I know, from reaction on the ground, that people acknowledge the Fianna Fáil led Government has again recognised what needs to be done in terms of social welfare to protect and improve the lot of those on pensions and social welfare benefits &ndash; those in need in every section of our society. The Government has done this consistently in recent years. The reason why it has and why this party has a record of caring for people is that, despite what commentators and academics suggest, we work with the people at every level of society. It is misleading to say that politicians are unaware of what is happening in our society. Most of us have clinics at weekends and are in touch by various means with everybody in our society including those in housing estates, on community councils, in community care and so on. None of us accept that we are out of touch.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the budget from some sectors of society who feel the Government has not given enough. I have no problem with criticism but I am concerned that whenever increases are granted they are never enough. It is incumbent on the Government and society that people in need are looked after and have the necessities for a respectable standard of living. Everything is not perfect. Persistent critics do not acknowledge what is being done and the decisions that have been taken in difficult times by various Governments to improve the lot of our citizens. The Government is trying to do its best but social welfare is not a job. We must give people sufficient money to look after themselves and have a decent standard of living but they cannot expect it to be the same as someone who is working 18 hours a day.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and his officials on putting together an excellent and improving service for those in need of social welfare in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are elements of the budget that any Member of the House would welcome. I have spent 14 of my 20 years in this House shadowing the Minister with responsibility for social welfare and I  was particularly pleased that the increases in old age and widows pensions were more than usual. There are many other good elements in the budget and we must give credit where it is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a responsible Opposition, we must also point out deficiencies. A large proportion of people who retire at 65 go on to retirement benefit, and, if they are lucky, a pension from their company. If they continue working, they cannot draw the retirement benefit but, amazingly, a year later &ndash; they can continue to work until they are aged 66 &ndash; they can get the old age pension and draw the benefit in full, plus the subsidiary <Col N="830" /> benefits, subject to the payment of tax. I do not understand why this cannot apply at the age of 65. Workers have given enough service by the time they reach the age of 65, but many of them cannot really retire because they would suffer too big a drop in income if they did so. I hoped by the time I finished my term in Dáil Éireann that this would be gone because I have spoken about it for many years.</P>
    <P>A constituent recently informed me of his post-budget situation. He is an employed married man whose wife works in the home and he will get an increase of £3 per week. He said that he had already got a notice informing him that bin collection charges would be increased to £204 in future &ndash; I understand Dundalk Urban District Council has a charge of £250. This is without paying any additional VAT, increased fuel costs or increased prices for cider drinkers. The 1% VAT will go down the line in addition to fuel increases and this will lead to an increase in the cost price of cars, car servicing, tyres and so on. Motorists received a bad hiding in the budget and social welfare increases, by and large, will not apply to them, except for one area which I will come to later.</P>
    <P>We should not get carried away with the idea that everything in the budget is good. I accept that no Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, or Minister for Finance, ever produced a budget that pleased everyone. That would be utopian and would probably mean we would all be on social welfare. There has to be a balance but there are a number of matters I wish to point out to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It was a bad budget for people on low incomes. I urge the Minister to take note of my point about the raiding of the social insurance fund. It was done to balance the books and to enable the Minister for Finance to avoid being embarrassed about breaking his own rules about high borrowings. My information is that an actuarial review of the likely cost of social welfare pensions has recently been completed. It is vital that we are told by the Minister whether this was based on assumptions of a larger social insurance fund than now exists. If that is the case, the exercise will have to be repeated and the results carefully reviewed by the social partners. The depletion of this fund has serious implications for workers and employers not just in relation to the cost of future pensions, but the likely need for future increases in PRSI to pay for them.</P>
    <P>It has serious implications for workers and unions who have lobbied for improvements in the social insurance scheme such as the introduction of parental leave benefit. It also has serious implications for the working groups that have produced proposals for a fully inclusive social insurance model and, where it had been examined, the establishment of a social insurance fund board with representatives of the social partners. If this latter objective had already been received, it might have been more difficult for a Minister to dip into a fund that was built up by workers <Col N="831" /> and employers to provide social insurance now and particularly in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, took 1% to put into a reserve fund to deal with future State pensions. However, this is a raid on pensions of industrial and commercial workers and those in categories other than the public service. This needs serious consideration because I do not know how long my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will be the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs &ndash; that probably will be decided in the new year &ndash; but it could be that the next Minister, or the one after, will find that he does not have enough money in the fund to meet the cost of social welfare pensions.</P>
    <P>There was enough money to bring the basic PAYE tax credits to a high enough level to take anyone on the minimum rate out of the income tax net, but this was not done. Workers on the standard rate of tax will only gain a mere £4.17 per week as a result of the meagre increases in tax credits. A single person will start paying tax once they start earning £165. One might ask what that has to do with the Social Welfare Bill and the Ceann Comhairle might remind me that I have strayed away from the subject matter, but it is interlinked in a positive way. Effectively, the increases in social welfare, because many people on social welfare or who are retired have cars now, will be totally wiped out.</P>
    <P>Another issue I have consistently pointed out to my colleague, the Minister, relates to FIS. There is no doubt that the increases in FIS will be substantial &ndash; at every level it may work out at £25 per week. A one child family whose income is less than £285.10 per week, the current income threshold, will get 60% of the difference between the net income and the new threshold. Net income is defined as gross pay less tax, PRSI, health levy and pension contributions. A person could be earning £300 per week and still have a net income below the one child threshold. The vast bulk of workers are not aware of their entitlements under the FIS scheme. I am sure other colleagues in the House have had similar experiences at clinics where constituents are mystified when the subject of FIS is raised. I often had to get out the leaflet to explain the system to people &ndash; I am sure the Minister has done it as often, if not more often, than any of us. I do not know if the reason people are not applying is because they are unaware of it or they are afraid to look for it, but many more people could be drawing it.</P>
    <P>A large number of people, even those earning £300 per week, could be drawing the benefit but they are not while many of those on the minimum wage are also not drawing it. I find that impossible to understand and I ask the Minister to give further consideration to how best this might be addressed.</P>
    <P>The best feature of the budget were the increases in child benefit of £25 per month for the first and second children and £30 per month for <Col N="832" /> the third and subsequent children. It would be even more impressive if it could be taken at face value as an honest attempt by the Government to honour its commitments under the PPF and reduce child poverty. There are other points of merit in the budget and on Committee Stage I will elaborate on my other concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is a farce. Whatever Tom Parlon might say, members of the IFA have made their views very clear. There have been no increases in the numbers of farmers covered by the scheme even when those who transferred from the widows' and disability schemes are included. Some 40,000 farmers have been on the streets seeking their inclusion in the scheme, yet only approximately 8,000 are covered.</P>
      <P>Widows under the age of 65 years are still not entitled to the free schemes. Widows or widowers who were in receipt of carer's allowance before the death of their spouse are no longer eligible for it because they are not allowed receive two social welfare incomes. That is totally unacceptable. It means that a widow on a contributory pension can take up another job but is not allowed to care for a relative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare provision for those on short-term unemployment assistance is insufficient to cover increases in the cost of petrol, diesel, refuse collection and rents. The Minister has deducted <Col N="833" /> money from people who had to leave this country years ago, such as pensioners in the UK. It is why he has been able to provide for others in this Bill but it is very unfair to those who were forced to leave.</P>

Before the Minister kills himself with laughter I will make a couple of points that might serve to chill his ardour as he meanders his way across the County Louth countryside when travelling home tomorrow. Over the four and half years since the Government took office, inflation, at approximately 20%, has been much higher than previously. The social welfare increases will not do much to ameliorate that.</P>

      <P>The Government is telling people that while it may give them increases this year they will be taken back with interest next year. It is being suggested that the increases will be paid from 1 January. That is not the case because they are being paid retrospectively. I suspect that had something to do with an impending general election. It might have been considered to be a great idea to backdate payments under the guise that they could not be introduced from 1 January because of the transition to the euro.</P>
      <P>The Minister should measure the social welfare increases of the past four and half years against the price of the average shopping basket. In that period some prices, such as house prices and rents, have doubled. What impact has that had on the social welfare increases? I did not hear Members on the other side of the House claiming responsibility for the price increases and I do not expect the Minister to write to social welfare recipients advising that the increases granted are a sleight of hand.</P>

      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Durkan blaming the Government for increases in prices and house rents. I always understood an increase in house rents depended on the amount of income to the household, so the Government can hardly be blamed.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for increases in the rates of social insurance and social assistance payments and improvements in the family supplement scheme as announced in the budget last week. Before referring to the specific changes which have been brought about by means of this Bill, I would like to refer, in broader terms, to this Government's commitment to helping the less well off and disadvantaged in our society and to put a few key facts on record. This Government has made the largest financial increases to social welfare programmes in the history of the State and has focused on the needs of our pensioners, parents, children and carers. It is important to consider the performance of the Government not only in light of this budget but in the context of the five budgets it has introduced. Social welfare reform and the financing of social welfare initiatives are an important element in this Government's action programme.</P>
      <P>Reforms of the social welfare system have been matched by income tax reform which has dramatically improved the position of low and middle income earners. Nobody in Ireland now pays tax at the higher rate until he or she earns more than £22,000. No income tax is payable until one earns £165 pounds per week. This Government has ensured that a further 68,000 people have been removed from the tax net as a result of the changes which have been brought about in last week's budget. This Government has also reduced the standard rate of tax from 26% to 20% and the higher rate has been reduced from 48% to 42%. Overall, therefore, tax rates have been reduced by 12 percentage points during the term of this Government compared to the 1% reduction introduced by the rainbow Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to helping the elderly in our society. In June 1997, the old age contributory pension was £78 per week. As a <Col N="835" /> result of the five budgets introduced by this Government, the old age contributory pension now stands at £116 per week. Personal rates of widow or widowers contributory pension and deserted wives benefit for those aged over 66 years of age are being increased by £12 per week as part of a phased increase in these payments to the same rate as the old age contributory pension. A special increase of £9.56 is being provided for in the rates of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance to bring these benefits in line with unemployment benefit, disability benefit and long-term unemployment assistance payments rates. Increases ranging between £8.06 and £9.06 per week are also being provided in the rates of qualified adult allowances for people aged under 66 years of age. The increases in respect of qualified adults aged under 66 years whose partners are in receipt of the old age non-contributory pension or invalidity pension is £9.00 per week. All these increases will take effect from the first week in January 2002.</P>
    <P>This Bill also gives effect to the PRSI changes which were announced by the budget. Section 5 provides for the reduction of 1.25% in the higher rate of social insurance contributions payable by employers. It also provides for an increase in the earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable by employers from £28,250 to £30,510. These changes will certainly help to reduce the level of PRSI contributions which employers have to make.</P>
    <P>The Government has done a great deal to help carers in our society. It is not only in this budget that increased benefits are being given to carers. Their needs have also been addressed in previous budgets which this Government has introduced. The personal rate of carers allowance is being increased from £88.50 to £96.56. If a carer is caring for more than one person, this rate of financial support is increased from £132.80 per week to £144.83 per week. The annual respite care grant is also being increased to £500. It is difficult to distinguish between different classes of beneficiaries in terms of who deserves more financial State support but, undoubtedly, we all agree that the role of carers in our society is a very special and important one and carers are deserving of substantial financial assistance. In welcoming the changes which have been brought about by the budget of last week with regard to the carers allowance, I would like to pay special tribute to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has promoted the needs of carers in our society at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>This Government has substantially increased the level of child benefit since it came to office. In September 1997, the level of payment available for child benefit was £30 for the first and second child and £39 for the third and subsequent children. As a result of changes which have been brought about by this Government, payments are now £92.50 for the first and second child and £116 <Col N="836" /> for the third and subsequent children. Nobody can deny that these are substantial increases over the lifetime of this Government. It is only right and proper that the needs of all our children are catered for and this Government has done much to ensure the welfare of our children is fully protected. In this budget, there were increases in the back to school clothing and footwear allowances. Last year, the Government broadened the availability of the free schemes programme.</P>
    <P>As a result of the changes announced by the Government, the allowances for electricity-gas, televisions and telephones were extended to all people over 70, regardless of their income or who lives with them. This year, a new household benefit scheme is being introduced to streamline the existing electricity and telephone allowance and free TV allowance into one combined package. This will ensure anyone who qualifies for one benefit will get all of them. This is a very sensible and welcome move.</P>
    <P>The changes announced by the Minister for Finance are fair and balanced. They protect the interests of the less well off and the disadvantaged in our society while ensuring that low and middle income earners receive substantial tax reductions. The budget helps parents and children, carers and pensioners. This is a caring Government and, over the period of five years it has greatly helped those in need and improved the quality of life for all our people.</P>

      <P>I welcome this brief opportunity to commend the Government and, particularly, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, on the provisions of the budget and the achievements of the past five years. There was much laughter on the Opposition benches when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, introduced his 1997 budget as the first of five. The laughter was rather depleted in the second and third years, there was scarcely a giggle in the fourth year and, by the fifth year, the reaction was more like panic. The Deputy Leader of Fine Gael had prepared a speech geared towards anticipated borrowings of £500 million, which did not happen. He was flummoxed at that stage. Deputy McDowell was probably going on the same lines, hoping the Government would resort to borrowing. He had issued a press release on 2 December in which he proposed taking £815 million from the national pensions reserve fund and spend £5.5 billion. He then had the cheek to criticise the Government, a few days later, for transferring a much smaller amount from the social insurance fund to the Exchequer. It is very easy for people to criticise the budget by claiming the allocation for one area or another was not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year's budget package was supposed to be incredible and it proved to be, but on this occasion the Minister has achieved a budget package of £850 million in a full year which is on a par with last year. At a time when one Opposition party believed we should borrow while the <Col N="837" /> other said that we should not rob Peter to pay Paul but that there was no other way to proceed, it is incredible that, in light of recent events, the measures outlined in the Social Welfare Bill are as good as could be expected.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has again given priority to pensioners and people in need. Despite Opposition protests to the effect that we have not dealt with the less well off, even members of the media accept that the facts speak for themselves in that regard.</P>
    <P>I commend the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister on the standard of information provided. The establishment of a budget hot line by the Department was commendable. If a number of other Departments were as user-friendly as the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, things would be great.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are delivering on promises given in respect of child benefit payments. I was first elected to the Dáil in the year the rainbow coalition introduced its last budget in which was granted a huge increase of £1 per month in child benefit payments. The weekly increase of 25p would not buy a bar of chocolate in 1997 and it was a great scandal that such a small increase was given. The £1 rise represented an increase of 3.4% whereas the Government is giving an increase of 37.1% this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to a figure of 20% for inflation, perhaps in an attempt to rub salt into the wound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>I was amazed by Deputy Hayes's complaints about the increase of 12 in the rates of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. The Deputy roundly condemned the Government for this, but in his pre-budget submission he suggested that the rates of payment for these allowances should rise to £94. The increase given by the Government will bring the rate to £93.56. Perhaps Deputy Hayes believes that a great deal can be done with 44p. He must accept that the Government is not far off meeting the target he set.</P>
      <P>A great deal more could be done for widows. However, Deputy Hayes has a problem with the fact that widows will receive a large increase in their payments on this occasion. Fine Gael proposed an increase of £10.90, whereas we have given them an increase of £12. It is scary that the Deputy should criticise an increase which improves on the proposal put forward by his party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has also given a £10 increase for pensioners and a £20 increase for pensioner couples, which is a worthwhile development.</P>
      <P>Some people might say carers have got nothing from the budget or from the Government. However, the Government has done a great deal for carers since entering office. I accept that there is much more to be done. One of the most important developments in this area was the introduction of the respite care allowance. Continuing to provide increases in carer's allowance will be a priority for the Minister when he returns to office for a further five years in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increases in carer's allowance of <Col N="839" /> £10 for those over 66 and £8 for those under that age. However, I want to see continuing increases in respect of the income disregard for the means test. I am glad there will be increases of £25 in respect of the income disregard for single people and £50 in that for married couples. Carers, widows and pensioners deserve our support and they have received such support during the Government's term of office. They can rest assured we will continue to focus on their needs when we are returned to power.</P>
    <P>A number of Opposition Members referred to the dates for payment increases. When the rainbow coalition was in Government, June, September and October seemed to be very popular months in which to grant increases. However, the current Administration has brought forward payment dates to January and February. Many people have complained that increases in the price of petrol are imposed immediately but that this is not the case in respect of increases in social welfare payments. I would like all increases to have been granted from 1 January. However, 275,000 people will receive increases in their rent allowance, family income supplement payments, carer's benefit, disability benefit, disablement benefit, back to work allowance, farm assist payments, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and pre-retirement allowance in January. In mid-February, a further 275,000 will receive increases in respect of their carer's allowance, one parent family payments, deserted wife's allowance, invalidity pension, widows' and widowers' pensions and orphan pension allowance. At the same time, increases will also be granted in respect of disability allowances, back to work allowances, pre-retirement pensions, old age contributory and non-contributory pensions and blind persons' pensions. Payment increases are now implemented well in advance of the dates on which they used to come into effect in the past. That is only right and proper and I commend the Minister on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Crawford referred to family income supplement. The rate of payment for this supplement has been increased again by £26.95 per week. I am familiar with many families who avail of these payments. FIS is extremely important to people in my constituency and I am glad the thresholds relating to it are being improved.</P>
      <P>Earlier, I commended the Department on the way it has streamlined the free schemes. This is the one area which needed to be streamlined and I am glad the Minister recognised that. It is good that people who are already eligible for one free scheme and who will now be eligible for all of them will not have to fill out a raft of forms. Form-filing appears to be incredibly popular at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that there has been a two thirds <Col N="840" /> increase in the spend on social welfare since 1997. The facts speak for themselves in that regard. I accept that there is much work to be done. If that was not the case, there would be no need for the Government to be returned to power after the next election. The Labour Party has already informed Fianna Fáil that it does not want to negotiate with us and its members have called us by many names. I inform Deputy Quinn that I am certain of my lineage and parentage and I do not appreciate being called names. Their record in Government speaks for itself. People can see through misdirected comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Seamus Healy.</P>
      <P>This Bill implements the social welfare changes set out in last week's budget. The increases in the various benefits and allowances are welcome as far as they go. They could go much further and could have gone much further over the past four and half years of this Administration. Stood alone, I could welcome this Bill. However, I cannot welcome it as part of a deeply flawed budget, the fifth in a series brought to us by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on behalf of a Government that threw away the best opportunity in the history of the State to redistribute wealth and build our economy on foundations of real equality.</P>
      <P>Ministers and other Government Deputies cheered the social welfare increases announced in the budget. The reality is that this State spends a much lower proportion of gross national product on social welfare than other EU countries. This State contributes 17.5% of GNP to social welfare compared to an EU average of 28.2%. A report by the European Foundation, the EU social policy research unit, published a little more than a week ago on 29 November, found this State to be fourth from the bottom of the 15 EU countries in terms of distribution of wealth. Only Greece, Spain and Portugal fare worse. A quarter of our children and one fifth of our adults are in households with less than half the average income. Some 500,000 adults in the Twenty-six Counties have basic literacy problems. The OECD has found that 26% of our young people have no useful qualification beyond junior level. This is the context of the budget and of this Social Welfare Bill. Notwithstanding the improvements, which I welcome, it is a sorry record as this Administration ends its term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own region, the Border region, comprising Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo, Louth and Donegal, we have not benefited fully as we should have been allowed to benefit from either the economic upturn of the past five years or from the elusive peace dividend. We have the highest rate of unemployment of any region. The Quarterly National Household Survey shows that unemployment in the Border region has jumped <Col N="841" /> from 5.5% to 6.8% this year. This is more than twice the rate of unemployment in the Dublin region. If this trend continues, it will be an unfortunate reality that the welfare payments covered in this Bill will be of interest to many more people in the Border region in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>Turning to some of the specifics of the Bill, I must express disappointment at the inadequate £8 per week increase for people in receipt of a whole range of payments, including one-parent family payment, invalidity pension, blind person's pension, carer's allowance, carer's benefit, disability benefit, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, farm assist and widow's and widower's non-contributory pension. The fuel allowance increase of £2.09 per week is an insult. After four years of scandalous neglect, the increase deserves disdain, and the low level of weekly payment still does not even reach the price of a bag of coal. In our pre-budget submission we in Sinn Féin called for the basic social welfare rates to be increased by £14 per week. It could and should have been done. Instead, corporation tax was reduced from 20% to 16% at a cost of 329 million in a full year, and the top rate of employer's PRSI was reduced to 10.75% at a cost of 347 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>We cannot look at the social welfare increases in isolation. It is those who are dependent on social welfare who are among the worst affected by the housing crisis, to give but one instance, and the crisis in our health service, to mention another. There was no new initiative on housing in this budget, but there was a bonus for property speculators and landlords. It is quite scandalous that the Government has restored interest relief on rented residential property and reduced stamp duty rates for investors. This will worsen the housing crisis by increasing property prices. In the meantime this Government has totally failed to protect tenants from rising rents and the growing rate of evictions.</P>
    <P>Social welfare recipients, the low paid, those in need of housing and those dependent on our public health system all could and should be in a much stronger and more secure position as we face into what may well be a prolonged downturn in the economy. We hope that will not be the case. However, this Government has ensured that the prosperous years have benefited the well off most while the ordinary citizen is once again left behind. The welfare of the people demands that such policies and the Government which pursues them should be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a budget of lost opportunities, a budget that discriminates as usual against the less well off in society. It directly attacks jobs in the cider industry in Clonmel. The budget could be described as one for bookies, builders, employers and landlords. Low paid workers will benefit to the tune of about £2 per week from this budget, an increase that will be wiped out immediately by the increase in VAT from 20% to 21%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> The social welfare increases are welcome, but this is the fifth year in a row that this Government has failed to give priority to the deprivation being experienced by the poorest people in society. This has happened while the country has been experiencing its most prosperous period ever. The choices that have been made have produced a situation where the poorest people are expected to live on £93.56 per week and the gap between rich poor, that is between a long-term unemployed person and someone earning £40,000 per year, has been increased again this year from £159 to £191, a widening of the gap by £32 per week. As a direct result of this Social Welfare Bill and the budget, the number of people living in relative income poverty will continue to increase and the gap between rich and poor will continue to widen. These same people, many of whom are in low paid employment, will have little or nothing to gain and will not even get the benefit of a medical card which was refused in this budget. Large numbers of people will continue to wait for accommodation on housing waiting lists throughout the country. Despite the unprecedented prosperity of recent years, poverty and social exclusion have not been tackled on anything like the scale that was possible, given the huge available resources that this Government has had at its disposal over the past five years. The most important requirement for tackling poverty is the provision of sufficient income to enable people live with dignity. This Government has failed dismally in relation to that: £93.56 simply does not allow a person to live with dignity.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the carer's allowance. The Minister has again missed an opportunity to do something for carers in this budget. Carers asked in their pre-budget submission for a non-means-tested payment and for the payment of the carer's allowance in addition to the social welfare payment being received by the individual. We still have a situation where a husband caring for his wife or a wife caring for her husband are not in receipt of any payment despite the fact they may be caring 24 hours a day. There are about 150,000 carers here and many who are in that situation will not get a single farthing as a result of this budget. Those who happen to be in receipt of an adult dependant allowance on the basis of the husband's payment will benefit by £25-£30 per week at most. Neither I nor the Carers Association accept that it is sufficient reward for people who care for others on a 24 hour basis. I urge the Minister to look at it again, to ensure that the carer's allowance payment is not means tested and to allow it to be paid in addition to other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The child dependant allowance has not been increased since 1996. While everybody welcomes the child benefit increases, they have been offset by the fact that there has been no increase in the child dependant allowance. Had that allowance been increased over the years, it would amount to approximately £26 per week instead of the £13.20 that is currently paid.</P>

The recommendation in relation to income adequacy says the majority of the group considered that the target of 27% of gross average industrial earnings for the lowest social welfare payments was not an unreasonable policy objective over the period 2002-07. That would imply, in effect, an annual average increase of £9.70. This year we increased the lowest social welfare payments by £9 or 56%, which is broadly consistent with the majority recommendation of the group.</P>

      <P>Deputies Hayes and Broughan referred to carers and another Deputy said nothing was done for them. That is incorrect. Over the five years of this Administration more changes have been made in the carer's allowance and in the add ons to that allowance than under any previous Administration. I challenge any objective observer to examine it. While I appreciate that lobby groups must criticise and continually push up the bar, the reality is that I have been inundated with correspondence&mdash;</P>

The improvements in this Bill, which the Deputy will vote against, amount to £12.62 million in relation to the carers disregard alone. It will include an extra 3,400 carers and provide an increased payment for another 2,300 carers. Over the lifetime of this Government the number of carers in receipt of the carer's allowance will have increased from 9,000 to approximately 25,000. The amount of expenditure on carer's allowance has increased 184% since this Government came to office.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne raised the issue of 29 weeks of payment and continues to disagree with me about it. Over the years we were berated for announcing increases on budget day and not paying them until much later, well after the tax changes were implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They were announced in December so there was a huge time lag. This Government has progressively brought the dates back. For many years we were told it was unfair that people on social welfare did not get their increases at the same time as others got their tax benefits. This is the first year we have aligned social welfare increases with the tax benefit increases. Next year they will be brought back three months, from 6 April to 1 January, in one fell swoop at a cost to the Exchequer of £80 million in relation to social welfare alone.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Browne will discuss the issue of the 29 weeks with my officials. We always work from a budgetary point of view on the basis of the calendar year. The House also operates on the calendar year. When we refer to people getting paid their 29 weeks we are basing that on the budget year. When one negotiates with the Minister for Finance there is always a debate over the full year or 52 weeks cost and the budget year cost. Ministers have finite budgets and it has been the case over the years, although thankfully not this year, that if they are particularly pressed for money, they will, to a certain extent, push out the date. Instead of introducing the change in April they might leave it to October so less money is expended between October and December.</P>
      <P>When this Government came to office the increases were only paid for 29 weeks of the budget year. This year they will be paid for 52 weeks of the budget year. It will be an additional cost but it will be an advantage to social welfare recipients. Apart from the percentage increase in their existing payments which is announced in the budget, the fact that they will be paid for an extra 23 weeks amounts to, on average, an extra increase of between 4% and 5% in their annual income.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan referred to the level of increase in the qualified adult allowance. The qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 years of age has increased from 72% of the old age contributory pension in 1997 to 77% in 2002&mdash;</P>

      <P>The review of the national anti-poverty strategy is nearing completion. That review will be the basis for action as far as this Government is concerned. In the PPF, the Government committed itself to spending £1.5 billion on social exclusion over a two-year and nine-month period. In our first budget under the PPF last year, we spent £1.3 billion. We are way ahead of the commitment on social inclusion that was made under the PPF. It is interesting that some Members made play of the fact that lobby groups were saying there was not enough in the budget. There is ESRI research published today in the newspapers. I challenge any Deputy on the far side of the House to read that.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies referred to the timing of the payments. The timing is related to the printing of the books. No-one will lose out as a result. Everyone will get their arrears in mid-February. That is six weeks earlier than the budget increases last year. It will be a cost to the taxpayer of £80 million but a benefit to the social welfare recipient.</P>

      <P>The essential point is that the increases will be effective from the beginning of January in all cases. That is earlier than ever before. Some Members have made great play of the fact that a part of this Bill takes money out of the social insurance fund. This fund was established 48 years ago. The taxpayer, over those years, has made a contribution of £11 billion. It is not unreasonable that there be a transfer of a small portion of that £11 billion back to the taxpayer.

    <Title>Standing Order 58: Announcement.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we proceed with questions I wish to make a brief announcement for the information of the House concerning a complaint that was received under Standing Order 58 concerning remarks made by Deputy Gildea during the course of Private Members' time on Wednesday 21 November 2001 in respect of a named company. I am making this announcement at the first available opportunity in view of the unusual circumstances which gave rise to this complaint without in any way establishing a precedent requiring the Chair to have to report to the House on every complaint received under Standing Order 58, which has never been the practice. It is therefore unusual in that respect that I am making this announcement.</P>
      <P>I have given careful consideration to all aspects of this matter including the debate on the motion of censure taken in the Dáil two weeks ago and in particular that the letter of complaint was all but read into the record in its entirety &ndash; the parts which were not read in were those which made counter allegations &ndash; and I have had a number of exchanges of communication with both the complainant and Deputy Gildea.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that Standing Order 58, which deals with complaints of this kind, is not an all-embracing comprehensive procedure which affords a complainant the same rights of redress as he potentially would have before the courts and the redress provided is that the complainant be enabled to incorporate an appropriate response on the record if it complies with other features of the Standing Order. The Standing Order goes on to state that the response shall be brief and strictly relevant to the questions at issue and shall not contain anything offensive in character. This is the balance between a Member's right to free speech and the right of an ordinary citizen to his good name. This is the balance struck by the Dáil in agreeing to this Standing Order. The decision by the Dáil was not taken lightly and I refer Members to the Dáil debate of 31 May 1995 in that regard.</P>
      <P>In this context Standing Order 58 sets out a detailed procedure for dealing with a <i>prima facie</i> abuse of privilege in cases where remarks in the nature of being defamatory are alleged to have been made.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2(<i>a</i>) of the Standing Order states, &ldquo;If the defamatory nature of the utterance is apparent at the time it was made during the course of proceedings, the Ceann Comhairle shall direct that the utterance be withdrawn without qualification&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate I asked Deputy Gildea to withdraw his remarks and he stated &ldquo;I accept the wishes of the Ceann Comh<Col N="852" /> airle and withdraw the offending remarks&rdquo;. In addition I sought confirmation from the Deputy that the withdrawal made at the time encompassed the charge made against the company concerned and I have received a reply from the Deputy dated 11 December which states:</P>
    <P>I confirm to the Ceann Comhairle that my statement of withdrawal as requested by the Ceann Comhairle during a debate on a motion on Private Members' time on Wednesday 21st November, 2001 applied to all my remarks including the remarks relating to the company concerned.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, in view of the provisions of paragraph 2(<i>a</i>) of the Standing Order, I will not be taking any further action on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 105 requests under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, were received in my Department from 1 July to 12 December 2001. Of these, a decision was taken to grant the request in 15 cases and to part grant it in 28 cases. In the remaining cases, 11 requests were refused, no records were held in respect of ten cases, seven requests were transferred, 13 requests were withdrawn and there are 21 cases ongoing. Requests received in my Department are processed in accordance with the Act. The implementation of the Act in my Department is kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Freedom of Information Act cannot operate properly unless full records are kept by civil servants? When I raised this issue previously with the Taoiseach, asking him when the long-promised guidelines on the keeping of records by civil servants in Departments would be promulgated, he seemed unable to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a procedure set out in all Departments for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act by each policy unit. The procedure is there and the process under those procedures is clear. There were a number of queries and requests when the Act came into effect for guidelines but those were cleared up at the time. There are no outstanding issues regarding implementation of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach misunderstands my question. We are quite happy with the pro<Col N="854" /> cedures in Departments regarding the application of the Act. My question related to the guidelines, which have been promised for over five years now. When will those guidelines, which relate to the keeping of written records by civil servants, be promulgated by the Government? Unless records are kept, the Freedom of Information Act is a fairly idle mechanism. According to the Taoiseach's reply there were no records available in response to ten requests.</P>
      <P>To put it bluntly, in some of the Scandinavian countries which led the way on this, freedom of information legislation operates indifferently because less records are now kept than prior to the implementation of the legislation. This is a promise made by the Government going back over four and a half years &ndash; that guidelines would be promulgated by the Taoiseach and the Secretary General of his Department setting out when and in what circumstances the need to keep written records would not apply, in what circumstances written records would have to apply and the nature of those records. Will the Taoiseach answer that question? He has avoided answering it so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are stipulations under the Freedom of Information Act and I have no information on any other guidelines. In all Departments there are guidelines stipulated which people must follow. It is assumed that records are being kept. In the ten cases there are no records because there are no records; there are issues there which are not within the remit of my Department and that happens to all Departments. There are no other guidelines in relation to freedom of information, to the best of my knowledge, under the framework that was agreed for processing the Act or under the rules on the right of access to records. Guidelines may have been promised under some other procedure, but I can only answer for my Department. The rules with which I am familiar include the Act itself, with which Deputy Noonan has said he has no problem, and the rules for the processing of information. I do not think there are any other Civil Service guidelines for keeping records and I believe Departments are continuing to keep records in the manner which has always been used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has either misunderstood my query or he is being disingenuous. I have absolutely no problem with the manner in which the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, operates in Departments as clear guidelines outline the procedures which are to be followed. The Taoiseach is correct to say that there are no guidelines about the keeping of records, but I am asking when such guidelines will be laid down as they have been promised on a number of occasions. Do circumstances exist under which civil servants are free not to record vital information in writing? The lack of such guidelines has been a flaw in freedom of information legislation <Col N="855" /> in other jurisdictions, including some states in the United States. The Government has promised that guidelines, not on procedures but on the keeping of records, will be promulgated at an early date. When will this happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's point, but all I can say to him is that I will check if a promise was made. I do not recall making such a promise when answering questions about freedom of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think guidelines are desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be an old set of rules. The only thing that has changed as a result of the Freedom of Information Act is that civil servants no longer keep manuscript notes, but such a practice was not set down in regulation. It is clear that there are fewer manuscript notes since the Act came into force, but I do not think such notes were ever part of the official procedures of health boards, local authorities and Departments. Some officials seem to keep notes and some do not, but it is not an official stipulation, as far as I am aware. I understand what Deputy Noonan is saying and I will check the matter for him. Clear Civil Service rules state that paperwork and internal memorandums should be retained, although I do not know if this has ever been set out in a circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How do civil servants know that documents should be retained if it has never been made clear? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an old rule. Some civil servants keep written records of telephone calls and retain written manuscripts, but some do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach communicate the results of his investigation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>My final supplementary question on this matter relates to a recent request I made under the Freedom of Information Act regarding the Government communications unit. The request was refused but the Taoiseach indicated in his reply that future requests will be acceded to now that a political appointee has left the unit. Can the Taoiseach confirm that all information will be made available if a request is made in relation to the communications unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my understanding. The original request was refused as a result of issues relating to a document which was considered to be confidential. I believe that normal information from the Government communications unit is <Col N="856" /> suitable for release under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Apart from the referendum which will arise following the passing of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, there are no plans to hold any other referenda prior to mid-2002.</P>
      <P>The Government has brought seven issues to the people by way of referendum so far.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the apparent difference of opinion in Cabinet on whether a referendum will be held following the passage of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill? The Tánaiste said on the Order of Business one morning when the Taoiseach was absent that she did not feel a referendum should be held on the matter without a national consensus to ensure its passage. The Leader of the Progressive Democrats in the Seanad, Senator Dardis, expressed a similar opinion when he spoke on Second Stage of the Bill in the other House. What is the Government's position? If a referendum is held, will all partners in Government participate in the campaign or will the Progressive Democrats be allowed to opt out?</P>

      <P>The all-party committee, which has done a good job, continues to deliberate on this issue and the Government intends to follow its advice, with which I totally agree. I answered the question in relation to the staging of the second Nice treaty referendum yesterday. I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions that EU enlargement can only take place if the Treaty of Nice is passed. If it was not clear before, it is now beyond doubt that the Amsterdam Treaty only allows for a small extension of the Union. This is not sufficient, as the report of the Commissioner, Mr. Verheugen, suggests that ten countries will join the European Union in the next year or so. The Nice treaty, therefore, will have to be revisited.</P>

        <b>: </b>Tens of thousands of Irish people are still subject to ground rent, which is a feudal imposition which dates back to the days of the landlords. The Taoiseach has hinted in the Dáil that there may be constitutional implications if we decide to remove <Col N="858" /> ground rents. Will the Taoiseach clarify this issue and prepare for a constitutional referendum in 2002 should it be required to remove this relic of the bad old days from the backs of the people? When introducing the ground rent Bill, will the Taoiseach provide for a referendum which might be necessary to allow people to own their homes in comfort and peace without being subjected to pressures from the relics of the landlord class.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach may be aware of two headlines which appear side by side in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which state, &ldquo;Cowen warns of consequences of failing to ratify the Nice treaty and &ldquo;Ahern refuses to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; on Nice poll&rdquo;. There is a certain amount of confusion when headlines such as these appear. This confusion arises from the fact that yesterday the Taoiseach would not say whether the Treaty of Nice needed to be ratified by a referendum or whether he had some scheme in his head for that purpose. Will he clarify the position?</P>

      <P>I did not get a chance to read the newspapers in any great depth. However, I heard the RTE news report on yesterday's Dáil proceedings which was clear and accurate as regards the position. The Government has not made a formal decision on this issue. However, I have indicated on several occasions, and I do so again, that the Treaty of Nice is a condition of enlargement. By 31 December 2002 all EU member states have to ratify the treaty to allow enlargement to go ahead, otherwise we block the entire enlargement process. Our EU partners and the accession countries are firmly of the view that enlargement requires this to happen so we can deal with the institutional changes and ratify the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated outside and inside the House that I am in favour of returning to the people on this issue. However, if it is decided to return to them, before doing so there are a number of things we have to do. We have to reflect on the reason for the people's decision and try to address those issues which we outlined in the discussion yesterday. A number of points were put to me to which I replied yesterday and we have to try to deal with those issues. It would be unwise not to try to resolve as many of them as possible beforehand, otherwise we would ignore the public, which none of us wish to do. We have no right to do so. We have to address the issues which the people put before us as best we can within the powers available to us and in a manner to which the <Col N="859" /> European Council and General Affairs Council will agree. That is the task for the months ahead.</P>

      <P>On many occasions I have raised the need to accord representation in the Oireachtas to citizens of the Six Counties as part of the developing peace process.

However, I detect from what the Deputy's colleagues are saying elsewhere that they do not wish to block the wishes of the countries who wish to join the EU in a new model of enlargement.

The effect of our position, and we cannot contradict it, is that we are successfully managing to block <Col N="860" /> enlargement. It does not cause a problem now, but it will do so in a year's time.</P>
      <P>The issue of representation is being debated. If my information is correct, the report of the committee is almost finalised and is imminent. I am not sure if it will be published before or after Christmas, but it is imminent. The matter will then have to be discussed among the parties in the House. We would need to seek agreement among the parties on this issue. It is more than likely that a constitutional change will be required and we would have to try to work out within the House how to achieve that position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from research by the European Commission and others that the main issue was confusion. People were confused. Looking at the statistical figures from a poll carried out after the referendum, it is agreed by the all-party committee and others that the people were confused. In many cases, making an argument for the sake of it, or putting strong arguments on either side created confusion. This matter has been deliberated on within the committee and it has given a clear recommendation with which I agree. This is an all-party committee, but it has made a clear recommendation.</P>
      <P>When a referendum is being held people can explain the issue. Whatever the issue, confusion is created when this House passes legislation and arguments have to be put forward and advertised. The referendum on the Treaty of Nice was not the first occasion on which there was confusion because there were many other issues in addition to the central one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin stated that he is favour of enlargement, but the trouble is that he is against the treaty which was about enlargement. I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that he was not alone. The figures show that the majority of the people were in that position. It is not that the people did not do their job, but, as suggested by the all-party committee, the system is not a good one.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach favour a proposition which would allow a committee of the House to establish the facts on any referendum to be put before the people and report either unanimously or by majority and minority reports? It could then be the job of the referendum commission to promulgate the facts as established by the committee of the House. Some of the judges who adjudicated on the McKenna case were strongly of the view that while the Government had done its job and the people had adjudicated, there had not been sufficient input by the Parliament. My proposal would be a way of combining what the Taoiseach is proposing with a very effective way of involving the Parliament to establish <Col N="861" /> the facts of the proposition being put before the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related. The Taoiseach may wish to answer both questions together. On the basis of what the Taoiseach has said in response to Deputy Ó Caoláin's observations and comments, there seems to be a legal dispute as to whether the enactment of the Nice treaty is a legal requirement to open the door to the process of enlargement. Enlargement is not merely a political act. It is also a legal act giving legal rights to applicant member states in relation to the treaties of the Union and the Community. In any other area where such a dispute arose on a matter of law, there would be recourse to the courts. Does the Government intend referring this legal dispute to the Supreme Court for an adjudication as to whether a constitutional amendment is required in order to provide for the enlargement of the European Union, whether by ten candidate states &ndash; as is probable &ndash; or more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What was raised at the time was the issue of institutional change. That was why a constitutional amendment and therefore a referendum were required. Three reasons were cited. There is no proposal to do as Deputy Quinn asks. I believe it would get us into another complex wrangle.</P>
      <P>The legal services of the Commissioner, the Attorney General and groups such as the Institute of European Affairs, who have examined the legalities, have all said the enlargement process cannot be followed by us without a constitutional amendment. The Amsterdam Treaty would have allowed six new member states but to allow ten new member states involves institutional change and for that we must amend our Constitution. Our challenge is to address the issues as best we can and put them before the people.</P>
      <P>There is some merit in looking at Deputy Noonan's suggestion in the longer term to set the case. The five reports on the McKenna case and the other issue raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin raise the possibility that while every Member of Parliament is in favour of an amendment, 50% of referendum funds may have to be allocated to some small outside organisation which opposes it. I do not refer to any particular organisation. In such a situation the sovereign Parliament would not be able to put its case. The issue raised by Deputy Noonan has some merit.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Taoiseach agree it is necessary to be extremely careful about moving with regard to the issues to which he has just replied and, as Deputy Noonan said, the Dáil <Col N="862" /> establishing facts? Facts can be established in a very partisan manner, depending on the parties which dominate their establishment. Does the Taoiseach agree it would not be in the interest of a healthy democratic debate on most issues of importance that are submitted to referendum if minority voices in the Dáil were not given due attention or the necessary time? In the Nice treaty referendum a substantial section of the people agreed with the minority voices in the Dáil. Does this not prove that one should be extremely careful before departing from the principles laid down in the McKenna judgment, an action I would oppose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. The people have a right to reflect their view and we must deal with that, unpleasant though it might be. Members of the House, even a small minority, also have a right to express their views. However, in several referendums the State, in order to establish a balance, has had to seek out contrary arguments and because there may be 15 valid arguments on one side we have almost been obliged to dream up an equal number on the other side. We have had to do this even if no one inside or outside the House was making these arguments. I do not think the McKenna judgment calls for this. I understand there must be debate and that the Government cannot spend the resources of the State in putting only one side of the argument, but seeking out counter arguments merely creates confusion.</P>
      <P>Members of this House are all democrats and we work hard at that. The nature of our business should not be to confuse. Nevertheless, I accept the Deputy's point. We must be careful.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress on the Government programme is kept constantly under review. Deputy Noonan will be aware that we recently published the fourth annual progress report. The action programme and its mid-term review contain 535 specific commitments and today, over four years after the last election, more than 80% of the objectives and action points have either been achieved or been significantly progressed. In implementing our commitments, we have introduced and implemented one of the most ambitious legislative programmes in the history of this State. Since this Government took office on 26 June 1997 an unprecedented 184 Bills have now been enacted. In addition, there are currently 44 Bills before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Given the scale of the Government's legislative programme and the large number of specific commitments set out in the action programme, it would be impossible in the time allotted to give complete details of the immense amount of progress we have made. The cornerstones of our action programmes were based on our desire to build a better Ireland for everyone and our core promises at the last election were to cut unemployment, taxes and crime and to work to build a lasting peace on this island. We have delivered spectacularly on all of these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said we would cut unemployment and we have. No Government has done more in addressing one of the major sources of disadvantage in our country, that of joblessness. We have been <Col N="864" /> responsible for the implementation of policies which have led to the creation of over 310,000 jobs, a dramatic reduction of unemployment from 10.7% to 3.7% and of long-term unemployment from 4.6% to 1.2%. Being so close to the ideal of full employment is the biggest social achievement in the history of the State. It is a fact that there are over 1.7 million people at work in this country today. Our employment growth rate is among the highest in Europe and despite the recent economic downturn the live register has been cut by almost 50%. This means that we are in a much better position to cope with the short-term economic difficulties which are now facing the world.</P>
    <P>We all know that the events of 11 September have hit the world economy badly and Ireland cannot expect to be immune to the impact of major international economic changes. However, I believe we have every reason for confidence in our economy even as we face into more difficult international economic circumstances. We have a sound economy, sound public finances and a sound approach to business and trade policies. Despite the downturn we are now facing in the short-term there are many positive assessments of the medium-term prospects for the Irish economy. These include estimates that a growth rate of close to 5% per annum is perfectly attainable over most of the decade. This would exceed the rate of our EU partners and support further improvements in tackling disadvantage and unemployment. In the future we will continue to implement policies to make certain that every single unemployed person in this country is offered every opportunity and support to get back to work in their own locality.</P>
    <P>We said we would cut crime and we have. Figures have fallen by an unprecedented 25% since this Government took office. Alongside the drop in crime the detection rate for recorded crime has increased significantly over our period in office. Ireland now has a detection rate of 42% compared to 21% in the USA and 26% in the UK. This is simply because, as we promised, this Government has given the Garda Síochána the resources to police our streets, waterways and airspace as never before.</P>
    <P>We promised to cut taxes and we have. We have introduced large tax cuts in every one of our five budgets which has meant real increases in take home pay for all sections of the labour force. As pledged, we have reduced the standard rate of tax from 26% to 20%, delivering on our pledge one year early. We have reduced the higher rate of tax from 48% to 42%. In total, we have cut tax rates by 12 points. We have been commended by the EU Commission for having a tax system that bears least heavily on the low paid. Our record over five budgets puts paid to the distortion that Fianna Fáil policy favours the better off. As the Minister for Finance pointed out on budget day, of the £3.78 billion or 4.8 billion we have provided in tax reductions, 43% has gone to increasing the basic tax allowances and a further 22% in <Col N="865" /> taking over 370,000 taxpayers off the top rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Within three weeks of our return to power the IRA announced another ceasefire. The Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent referendums clearly demonstrated that the people of this island wanted their politicians to put in place and operate the structures set out in the Agreement. Most aspects of the Agreement have been implemented. I am very proud of the record of my Government in setting out an ambitious programme, earning the support of the electorate and implementing its promises in office. Over the remainder of our term we will complete this work and be in a position to present to the people an unprecedented record of delivery and achievement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The Garda Vote has increased by 48% since this Government took office and by 2002 we will have increased the number of gardaí by 1,200. Over 1,200 additional prison spaces have been provided in our prisons building programme. We have ended the revolving door syndrome in our prisons and have invested unprecedented funding in crime prevention measures. Credit is due to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has enacted more legislation than any predecessor.</P>
    <P>The last Government merely cut the standard rate of tax by one point. Over our term we have provided more in personal tax reductions than any other Government and almost £2.5 billion more than the last Government. We have beaten the record of the last Government ten-fold in removing taxpayers from the tax net. Over all our budgets, 380,000 taxpayers have been removed from the tax net compared to 38,000 removed by the Rainbow Government. In this year's budget 68,000 people will be removed from the tax net.</P>
    <P>In budget 2002 further substantial progress has been made towards our intention to increase the income tax entry point towards the level of the minimum wage. In this year's budget, by increasing the basic personal tax credit and the PAYE tax credit we have raised the entry point to the tax system for a single person to £165 per week. When we came into office the relevant entry point was £77 per week. The entry point to the income tax system will now be at 90% of the current minimum wage.</P>
    <P>On 2 December 1999 the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement were established and the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, enshrining in particular the principle of consent, took effect. The Government continues to work closely with the British Government and with the political parties in Northern Ireland to secure the implementation of outstanding aspects of the Agreement. Recent months have seen progress on an agreed new beginning on policing, demilitarisation and decommissioning and on the inclusive operation of the institutions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I announced the appointment of a new Information Society Commission on 27 November and am circulating a list of its members in the Official Report. It is being chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former president of DCU. A sum of £564,683, or 717,000, has been provided under my Department's Vote to support the work of the commission in 2002. As I indicated to the House on 20 November the appointment of a new Information Society Commission is in the context of a range of measures agreed by the Government in June to strengthen its approach to information society issues. These include a new Cabinet committee on the information society and a complementary e-strategy group at Secretary General level.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the information society agenda is central to our future economic and social development. I am confident that the new commission will play a key role in shaping the Government's response and in highlighting the public policy issues that need to be prioritised.</P>

    <P>Unfortunately I will be absent tomorrow as I am meeting the French Minister for Foreign Affairs in the morning and later will be leaving for Laeken. With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to wish a happy Christmas to all the Members of the House, all the staff and all those who serve in the House and particularly to Deputy Noonan and his family and Deputy Quinn and his family. During the year we frequently cross swords, but I hope that at Christmas we can all have a rest and a break. I thank the Deputies for their on-going work as part of the democratic process and hope that all the Members of this House and the Seanad and all the staff can have a good Christmas.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for managing to keep the affairs of the House in order for another 12 months and I offer my apologies if we have created too many difficulties for you on this side of the House. Happy Christmas to one and all.</P>

I also wish the Taoiseach and his family, Deputy Quinn, all the Ministers and Deputies in the House and all the Senators a happy and enjoyable Christmas, and also the staff of both Houses who have been so helpful to us during the year. Everybody should get a rest over Christmas as there looks to be little prospect of a rest, once the new year comes, until after the great event.</P>

I thank you for your co-oper<Col N="868" /> ation during the year, a Cheann Comhairle, and apologise for any excessive parliamentary zeal on our part, which from time to time might have been misconstrued as demonstrations of affection and loyalty, that would otherwise have caused you some difficulty. I would also like to extend, through you, our appreciation and thanks to all your hard pressed staff in the Oireachtas and to all associated with the security of these premises and with the feeding and provisioning of everybody who comes to work here. I thank them all and wish them a happy Christmas and a prosperous and politically productive new year.</P>
      <P>By my calculations we have about 156 days from today to polling day. It is a rest for Christmas and then back to business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I apologise for my voice and hope it will last for Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht, and the Islands I have no legal function in the matter of the selection of the Director of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA. This function is specifically reserved to the board under paragraph 25 of the articles of association of the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company. Under this <Col N="869" /> article the board has sole responsibility for the appointment of the chief executive who is the director of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.</P>
    <P>My function in relation to the director is confined to approving, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, the remuneration, terms of office and other conditions of service as determined by the board.</P>
    <P>Neither have I any responsibility, legal or otherwise, for the procedures adopted for the conduct of meetings of the board of IMMA. These are determined by the directors in accordance with articles 33-41 of the articles of association of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.</P>
    <P>Two directors of the board submitted letters of resignation to me on 27 November referring to concerns they had in regard to the selection process for the appointment of a new director. I met them on 29 November to hear at first hand of their concerns. I made it clear that my role at that meeting could only be to listen to what they had to say. In arranging to meet the two directors in question, I indicated at the same time that I also wished to meet the chairman of the board. However, the then chairman tendered her resignation on 30 November with immediate effect and before any meeting could be arranged.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, I categorically refute any suggestion that I made any views known about any of the candidates for the director-chief executive post at IMMA, neither were my views canvassed on the matter by any member of the board.</P>
    <P>On Friday last, 7 December, I announced the appointment of Mr. Eoin McGonigal SC, as chairman of the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA. He has been a member of the board since February 2000. As I said last Friday, I am pleased that Mr. McGonigal has agreed to become chairman of the board of IMMA and I am confident he will provide the necessary leadership for this national cultural institution in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I will make decisions filling the vacancies created by the resignation of three directors from the board of IMMA in due course. I am confident the appointment of Mr. McGonigal as chairperson and of the persons that I will appoint to fill the other vacancies will result in a board that can put the past behind and move the Irish Museum of Modern Art forward with confidence into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that she had an opportunity to meet the two board members who resigned to discuss matters. Will the Minister indicate if they suggested that the selection process was faulty or was it carried out in a proper manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the very specific allegation of outside interference made in their letters of resignation by the two board members who resigned, by the chairman who subsequently resigned and by another highly respected board member, Ms Fiona O'Malley. It <Col N="870" /> was alleged that the attitude of the Minister towards the appointment of this eminent Irishman in Australia was conveyed to them. Will the Minister say if she was aware of this, and if she made her own views on the appointment known to board members or a third party?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that this episode has been handled in a ham-fisted and spiteful manner? The professional and personal integrity of honourable people has been undermined in a scurrilous way, not least that of Mr. Brian Kennedy who holds a very high position of international repute in Australia, who has been irredeemably damaged by the way in which this saga has been handled from beginning to end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the two board members who resigned because they had written to me, as well as given their letters of resignation to the papers. I wanted to hear from them, and as I indicated in my reply, my role was very much a listening one. I made it quite clear in a press statement that I met them and had every intention of meeting the chairman to discuss matters with her. The meeting with the two members was on the 29 November, the resignation of the chairman was on the following day, 30 November, and it was with immediate effect before any meeting could be arranged.</P>
      <P>The implication of outside interference has annoyed me greatly. There was no question of me interfering. My function in regard to the director is confined to approving, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, their remuneration, term of office and other conditions and I have no say &ndash; nor would I wish to &ndash; in whom the board would choose to be director. It is purely a matter for the board and it is not up to the Minister of the day to get involved in its affairs. I give categorical assurance to this House that I did not express a view, either about the candidate to whom the Deputy refers, or to any other candidate, either directly or indirectly. I consider any suggestions to the contrary as being entirely mischievous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the major issue arising from this sorry saga centres on the prestige of the Irish Museum of Modern Art and that restoring full confidence in it is of paramount importance, particularly in regard to people who might donate works to it?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister inform us as to the investigations she carried out in regard to the allegations of interference? I accept what the Minister said to us, but it concerns me that a person could make a statement to the effect that the Minister's preference had been indicated. Does the Minister have any idea as to what gave rise to that allegation, which was made on the national airwaves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make any particular view known, either about that candidate or any other candidate, either directly or indirectly and I cannot be any clearer than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> With regard to the morale and the business of IMMA, some would say that over the past year or so, the situation there has been somewhat turbulent. Whether one believes that, it is important that the new chairman, Mr. McGonigal, will give the leadership required to move forward and decide on the next director, and I have every confidence that he will. The choice is a matter for the board and is not one for me.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting with staff members and they want to see confidence being restored in the museum. I share that view, and anyone who is aware of its tremendous reputation over the past ten years would wish to see it going from strength to strength. The necessary leadership will be given by the new chairman. The best way to continue is to look forward. I do not propose to take a great length of time to decide on other nominations to the board. It is a matter of great importance and I will consider it imminently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if Dr. Kennedy has formally refused the offer of appointment? Will she advise if there have been indications of other resignations from the board and, if so, if these have been conveyed to her? Does she agree that if this continues the board will disintegrate? In view of the damage inflicted on the professionalism and qualifications of an imminent Irishman of international stature, does the Minister agree that perhaps the State, which has inflicted this damage on his character and reputation, should issue him with an apology? Mr. Kennedy's work has been recognised world-wide, yet he has been castigated in Ireland. What has happened is shameful and disgraceful and he deserves an apology from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in view of the current situation and bearing in mind the adverse publicity at the time of the departure of the former director, an intervention by her at an earlier stage could have been productive? Has she sought to establish why people alleged that they were made aware of her preferences and has she endeavoured to have such allegations substantiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of Dr. Kennedy's position, referred to by Deputy McGinley, is a matter for the board and is not one on which I should comment. I have not commented privately or publicly and do not intend to do so. I adhere to the articles of association which make it clear that the Minister has no say in this matter.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that any further members of the board wish to resign. I have taken the opportunity to contact them as a matter of courtesy because I wished to advise them of the appointment of Mr. Eoin McGonigal as the next chairperson before they read it in the newspapers. His appointment was warmly welcomed. There is no question of any further resignations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to the controversy surrounding the resignation of the previous director <Col N="872" /> and asked why I did not intervene. It is amusing that one section of the Opposition alleges that I interfered where I should not, which I categorically deny, while another says I should have intervened in an earlier controversy. These are matters for the board and not for the Minister of the day. I again categorically deny that there was any interference by me and I did not ask anybody to make my views known, directly or indirectly. I kept them to myself.</P>

      <Quest>if she will use her powers under the Broadcasting Act, 2001, to separate TG4 from RTE; and if she will request the Minister for Finance to provide an adequate sum to fund Irish language broadcasting services.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Part 4 of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, which came into effect on 1 September, provides me with enabling powers to establish Teilifís na Gaeilge, known as TG4, as a separate statutory entity. The process of establishing Teilifís na Gaeilge as a separate statutory entity will be complex and many significant issues will have to be addressed. I expect the process, which I hope to put in train soon, will take approximately two years. In the meantime I will continue to ensure that Teilifís na Gaeilge is adequately funded, having regard to current budgetary constraints. My commitment and that of the Government to the on-going development of the station has been evidenced by the manner in which funding for Teilifís na Gaeilge has been very significantly increased during my term as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that given that TG4 is part of the RTE organisation, the deteriorating financial situation at RTE could undermine the operations of TG4 to the point where it could become completely dependent on RTE for funding? Does she also agree it is essential to separate the stations and establish TG4 as an independent body as soon as possible? Given that this process will take approximately two years, the financial situation at RTE could threaten the viability of TG4 unless proper funding arrangements are made as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that those working in TG4 are young, vibrant and committed and are part of an excellent organisation. That is why I was very pleased to provide the station with increased funding of 100% since I took up office in 1997. It is a demonstration of the Government's commitment. I was also pleased to ensure that additional funding of £2 million was allocated in 2001 for programming. The budget also allocated an extra £1 million. This funding is in recognition of the tremendous service provided by the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Broadcasting Act was enabling legislation to allow for the establishment of TG4 as a separ<Col N="873" /> ate statutory entity. A number of issues need to be addressed. These include the ongoing funding levels at the station, the relationship with RTE, including access to RTE facilities and archival material, transmission costs following the establishment of the transmission company, the introduction of DDD and the fine detail regarding the transfer of assets to TG4.</P>
    <P>When I introduced this legislation there was nervousness among those in TG4 because they did not want these steps to be taken too quickly. It is important that there be agreement and a smooth transition to the establishment of the station as separate entity. That is why approximately two years will be needed to resolve matters although I hope to soon begin the process. The allocation of funding is a demonstration of the Government's appreciation and recognition of the work done by TG4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have figures on how much TG4 would require on an annual basis to ensure that the station is run effectively and efficiently while maintaining present standards and output? My advice is that will require approximately 40 million per annum. TG4 has been operating for the past five years. It is an opportune moment to separate the station from RTE to allow it to be independent and to develop according to its own plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I will continue to ensure that TG4 is adequately funded, having regard to current budgetary constraints. Without wishing to repeat myself, there has been a tremendous increase in funding, I know of TG4's plans for the future and, given budgetary constraints, I will continue to do all I can to ensure that funding is available for it.</P>

I also met with the RTE trade union group on 29 November 2001. Our discussions ranged over the current financial position of RTE and the actions being taken by the authority to correct emerging imbalances. I noted that responsibilities for managing finances was a matter for RTE in the first instance and restated the position of the Government on what needed to be done by RTE <Col N="874" /> before any further increase in the television licence fee could be considered.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, the RTE trade union group made a submission to the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language. They were seeking three things and I ask the Minister to comment on those. First, they asked for an immediate review of RTE's funding in the context of its performance as a public service broadcaster. They also sought a commitment to indexation and/or an increase in licence fee. Their other concern, which I believe the Minister would also find alarming, is that there are, allegedly, up to 240,000 householders not paying a television licence. I found that extraordinary and I put it to the Minister that, if that is the true position, she has a responsibility to see that that money is collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my initial reply, I met the trade unions to discuss relevant issues and I took the opportunity to state again that public service broadcasting was of extreme importance. During the debate on the broadcasting legislation which I brought to this House, I reiterated, very clearly, the position of this Government with regard to public service broadcasting. I also said that, whereas this philosophy is extremely important, we have to live in the real world and to take account of constraints in terms of commercial viability. I believe these two considerations can be balanced.</P>
      <P>With regard to increasing the licence fee, I have made it quite clear at any meetings I have had, either with the Authority or the unions or, indeed, in this House, that the increase of £14.50 in the licence fee was an interim increase and that there was an opportunity, in the context of the Government decision, to come back in 2003 once the provisions of that Government decision had been completed and verified independently. I have said that if a situation was to arise whereby RTE could complete that process long before 2003 and if it is independently verified, I would be delighted to meet RTE then to see what could be done at that stage. I made the point again that, even if there had been a greater increase in the licence fee, we would still be discussing the existing problems and imbalances and the need for cost cuts. I agreed that the issues went beyond questions of efficiency and effectiveness and, indeed, were structural in nature. This issue was discussed at length at both meetings, including my meeting with the unions.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the third point put forward by the Deputy and he is perfectly correct &ndash; this matter was raised in the discussions with the unions with regard to the question of collection. As the Deputy knows, there is an arrangement with An Post for the collection of the licence fee and we can continue to look at that as one of the issues for review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply but would she not agree that there is a need for <Col N="875" /> action now? Lyric FM is losing its news service, the programme making capacity of Raidió na Gaeltachta is effectively being greatly reduced and, in the context of RTE losing its outside broadcasting units and workshops, its capacity to produce programmes of an Irish nature and of a public broadcasting nature is sadly being curtailed. Will the Minister outline the areas in which RTE has to come up to scratch, so to speak, to secure an earlier review than at the end of 2003? In general terms, does the Minister believe that, where the unions have indicated, as they did at our meeting yesterday, they are prepared to take the pain to get things right, it might be possible to have all the outstanding areas addressed much more quickly? Will she tell us what those areas are? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed within RTE and in Government that there is a need for action at this time. That has been evidenced by the fact that the transformation agreement has been agreed by unions and management in RTE. There is a need for cost cutting and I believe that is accepted by everyone. However, the questions the Deputy is posing to me this afternoon are not questions for me &ndash; they should be posed to the RTE Authority. The Minister and Government of the day have no say in the type of programming or cost cutting that should take place. That is a matter for management and unions within RTE. That is the very specific role of the authority and that is why the arm's length principle exists.</P>
      <P>With regard to programming, the issues in relation to Lyric FM and Raidió na Gaeltachta were raised, as the Deputy knows, in the Irish Language and Heritage Committee. I gave an undertaking at that committee meeting that I would pass on those views to the authority, as I did when I met that body the following day. I made it quite clear, both at the committee meeting and in passing on those views to the authority, that I was doing so as a matter of courtesy because I have no say whatsoever in RTE programming or how the cost reductions will be brought about. I suggest that the Deputy reads the PricewaterhouseCoopers report in which he will see the kind of direction that needs to be taken to put RTE's house in order.</P>

      <P>I propose to continue to work towards the implementation of the Government <Col N="876" /> decision in relation to the establishment of a DTT platform in Ireland by means of the two separate processes that are ongoing at present. The Government decision provided for the sale of the RTE transmission business as a going concern and that RTE could retain an equity stake of up to 28% in the new entity created. I should point out that RTE's original proposal for the introduction of DTT in Ireland was premised on the sale of its transmission business. RTE is at present engaged in a process that will lead to the sale of that business.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that if RTE is obliged to proceed with the sale of this national asset, it will probably exacerbate an already serious financial situation in RTE? The Minister has mentioned the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the financial situation in RTE in which it was envisaged that RTE would accrue a net £27 million from the sale of that asset. With BSkyB entering the fray and RTE being forced to sell at a bargain basement price, does the Minister not agree that there will be severe financial implications for the station? Does she have any plans to make up the shortfall in respect of the £26 million the report envisaged that RTE would receive from the sale of this national asset?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE has not indicated to the Department that it is having second thoughts in relation to the sale of its transmission business. RTE is responsible for planning and managing the transmission network sale process and the Government has mandated me to oversee that process to ensure that it does not inhibit the achievement of the Government's objectives in respect of the introduction of DTT. There have been ongoing and extensive formal and informal contacts between the Department and RTE and their respective advisers in relation to the DTT project. Aspects of the project have been discussed at various meetings I have had with representatives of RTE, a number of which were attended by the chairman of the authority.</P>
      <P>It was never envisaged that DTT would be the only digital platform; we are also considering digital cable and digital satellite platforms. The Government chose the DTT option for two reasons, namely, universality and the fact that it is free to air. I do not believe that the involvement of RTE with Sky will affect the implementation of DTT. As already stated, there is a strong Government proposal on the table and the Government's decision is being implemented. We expect DTT services to be launched in the latter half of next year.</P>

The structure to which the question refers involves the establishment of two companies. However, the PwC report refers to digital programming which is a separate issue. Unfortunately, there appears to be a degree of misunderstanding and confusion in respect of this matter. The question tabled by the Deputy refers to the structures involved rather than to digital programming.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a number of applications for funding from the Irish Seal Sanctuary. The Irish Seal Sanctuary has made many approaches in the past for aid in running its existing facility at Garristown and for the provision of a new facility at Rogerstown. I met some time ago with representatives of the Irish Seal Sanctuary at their request to discuss their future plans for the sanctuary and officials from my Department later examined their draft development plan. I am advised that this examination shows that the work of the Irish Seal Sanctuary involves the rehabilitation of injured or distressed seals and caters for a relatively small number of injured seals and that the main thrust of the proposal is to provide for the welfare of a small number of individual animals rather than dealing with the conservation of the overall seal population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made it clear on previous occasions that my responsibility under the Wildlife Acts is to protect seals and other species to ensure the conservation of the species as a whole. I am not responsible for the welfare of individual animals. <Col N="878" /> The work of the Irish Seal Sanctuary is of a welfare nature and, as such, does not come within the remit of my Department. While I recognise the work carried out by the Irish Seal Sanctuary, such work does not, from a conservation point of view, impact significantly on overall seal numbers. The overall conservation context is that seals are not endangered in Irish waters. The estimated total population between Britain and Ireland of both common and grey seals is circa 210,000. In these circumstances there is no justification on conservation grounds for the provision of funding by my Department to the Irish Seal Sanctuary for this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. The Irish Seal Sanctuary has dealt in the past with many endangered species and plays a critical role in the area of wildlife conservation, which comes under the remit of her Department. I ask the Minister to take into account that the sanctuary has available to it a unique body of experience which is not available anywhere else in the country. Local authorities often make use of its services. Will she use her influence to ensure the promises made to the Irish Seal Sanctuary to the effect that, because its work is recognised, it will receive the £1.8 million capital funding required? Fingal County Council has already provided a site for the new development. Will the Minister, who indicated that it is not her job to assist the sanctuary, ensure that this project does not fall by the wayside?</P>
      <P>The Irish Seal Sanctuary has dealt with many species, native and non-native, such as tigers and rare mammals indigenous to these shores. I accept that its work with seals is largely responsible for the sanctuary's public appeal. Will the Minister support the work being done by the sanctuary, which goes beyond caring for seals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the commitment Deputy Sargent has shown to the Irish Seal Sanctuary. He and other Members have tabled questions about this matter on many occasions. I have always been consistent in stating I can only deal with matters of conservation and I do not believe that the numbers of seals cared for by the sanctuary would warrant my intervening on a conservation basis. Many Members believe this is a matter of animal welfare. However, animal welfare is not my responsibility. It is not a question of my kicking for touch on this matter; it is simply not contemplated under the Wildlife Act. My responsibilities in this area relate only to conservation. I have never made any promises in respect of funding because I would not be in a position to provide such funding in view of the fact that this matter does not come under my Department's remit.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that dismissing the notion of providing funding for the <Col N="879" /> Irish Seal Sanctuary on the basis that its work is animal welfare oriented is an admission that she does not see the complete picture? The work of the sanctuary comprises heritage, educational and tourism aspects. Does she agree that we should not be proud of the fact that Ireland is the only coastal nation which does not have an official seal sanctuary? Next year is designated the year of ecotourism and, contingent on the provision of funding, an education centre is to be opened at the Irish Seal Sanctuary. Bearing that in mind, will the Minister not take the initiative and encourage other relevant Ministers to put together a package which would ensure the future of this important facility?</P>

It comes down to the remit of my Department. We are not talking of tourism and education. The only aspect under consideration is conservation. The seal population, I am glad to say, does not necessitate intervention on the basis of conservation. That is the only basis on which I could become involved.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister accept that the excellent work of the Irish Seal Sanctuary not only contributes to conservation of the seal species but engenders a very fine respect for nature generally and the habitats around our coasts? Does she accept that creatures other than seals can be vulnerable? In view of that will she heed our warnings of the real danger of the permanent closure of the Irish Seal Sanctuary which would be regretted by a very large percentage of people? Does she know the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach have been lobbied on this? Will she make arrangements for funding from them as well as from her own Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No one would wish to see the Irish Seal Sanctuary closed because its work is very much appreciated, a fact I do not have to underline here. However, it comes down to the remit and responsibility of my Department. It is known that the Irish Seal Sanctuary does very good work, but its work relates to animal welfare for which I have no responsibility. Animal welfare is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. My concern is conservation and that issue does not arise at this time.</P>

Would she, therefore, accept that the Irish Seal Sanctuary has a much greater remit than its name suggests because of the dependence on its expertise which many local authorities have when, as often happens, very rare species are brought to them in need of care? Would she therefore spearhead the cross-Departmental approach which is needed to ensure this centre does not close and the expertise which has been built up scattered to the four winds and lost, perhaps, to other countries that value the work of such a sanctuary?</P>

      <P>On Deputy O'Shea's question, it would be interesting to know how other countries approach this issue. However, we must deal with our own legislation, which, in terms of the Wildlife Act which I initiated in this House and brought to fruition, is very up to date. Deputy Sargent raised the question of the golden eagles. That was a project I was very pleased to support because it will be wonderful to be able to reintroduce the golden eagle to Donegal and to Ireland. We are, of course, talking about conservation first and foremost. Although there will be many projects which will incorporate heritage, tourism and education, for my Department to have any responsibility, the premise of any of these projects must be based on conservation. It was very clear that was the issue in the example given by Deputy Sargent of the golden eagles. It is not the position with regard to seals.</P>

      <P>If the BCI is to have overall responsibility for dealing with national assets in <Col N="883" /> broadcasting, assets which are limited and given out by licence, would it not be in the national interest that the Government have a say in the long-term ownership of these facilities?</P>

      <P>The BCI report refers to its responsibility to formulate and apply a policy that takes account of plurality of ownership and diversity of content in broadcasting. The report states that the commission undertook a wide ranging public consultation process with the broadcast sector and the public before producing its report. This is a matter for the BCI. It was important that the consultation process took place and the commission ensured it did. On foot of that, it published its policy document on ownership and control of the independent broadcast media. This issue is specifically the responsibility of the BCI.</P>

She can tell Members that it is a matter for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland but the law is made in this Chamber. A policy paper has been published by the BCI which has potentially serious implications for press freedom in this country.

The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has statutory responsibility under section 60 of the Broadcasting Act and under Parts 3 and 4 of the Radio and Television Act. That was decided in the House and it is now law. It is to comply with that law that the BCI independently supplied its policy document on the issue of ownership.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion provided by Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam to take part in the adoption of the following proposed measure:</P>
      <P>a proposal for a Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between member states,</P>
      <P>a copy of which proposed measure was laid before Dáil Éireann on 11 December, 2001.</P>
      <P>I am grateful that the House has been able to create space in a busy Dáil schedule to facilitate debate on this important motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member and every citizen we represent knows that the appalling atrocities committed in the United States on 11 September last have shocked the world into the realisation that internationally organised terrorism threatens us all. Before our eyes, we saw the evil of terrorism strike with devastating effect at the heart of the most powerful nation on earth. The impact of this shock has been enormous. Those who suffered <Col N="885" /> most are obviously the families and friends of the dead and injured, many of them Irish or with Irish connections. Apart from that, global business confidence has been shaken, international travel has been significantly curtailed and a war is being waged in Afghanistan as a direct consequence of the 11 September attack.</P>
    <P>Another direct outfall of the attacks has been a substantial acceleration in the evolution and development of proposals to counter international terrorism. The main purpose of today's debate is to enable the House to debate two such proposals which have emerged in the recent past at EU level. Before discussing the proposal, it is appropriate that I say something about the pace and the range of activity taking place within the European Union justice and home affairs area, commonly referred to as the third pillar area.</P>
    <P>The reality is that in recent times, the pace of third pillar activity has greatly exceeded activity levels in the first and second pillars. Respected independent experts have commented on this. In a recent article dealing with the area of freedom, security and justice, for example, Professor Monar of the Sussex University Institute has stated that:</P>
    <P>The European Union has now entered the new millennium with a new major political project which future historians may well regard as another of these defining ventures: the creation of the &ldquo;area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, it occupies the same rank as a fundamental treaty objective as, for instance, the implementation of a common foreign and security policy, the single market and economic and monetary union. Politically, its longer term significance could be even greater than that of these earlier important projects because it is all about delivering a range of essential public goods to the citizens of the European Union. These include key issues of internal security and access to justice, areas which have historically played a central role in legitimising the build-up of public authorities and the creation of the modern state and which &ndash; much more so than, for instance, foreign and security policy matters &ndash; are of direct concern to citizens.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state that:</P>
    <P>There is no other example in the history of European integration of a policy-making area which made its way as quickly and comprehensively to the centre of the treaties and to the top of the EU's policy-making agenda. Ten years ago &ndash; at the beginning of the 1990s &ndash; what was then called justice and home affairs did not even exist as a policy-making area within the scope of the treaties, and the limited co-operation between the member states, which had been building up since the mid-1970s, took place in a range of poorly co-ordinated intergovernmental groups which lacked adequate institutional structures, legal instru<Col N="886" /> ments and objectives. Today, after the Amsterdam reforms, the additional impetus given by the 1999 Tampere European Council, and a broad range of legislation adopted or in preparation, policy-making in justice and home affairs has not only become a fundamental treaty objective but also one of the most dynamic and expansionist areas of EU development in terms of generating new policy initiatives, institutional structures and its impact on European and national actors.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September, have added further impetus to the evolution and development of EU third pillar proposals. This, not surprisingly, imposes quite considerable pressure at both official and ministerial levels for countries such as ours with limited resources. We must maintain pace with our EU partners, many of whom are much more heavily resourced than we are. Apart from that, there is &ndash; and will be &ndash; additional pressure on national parliaments in respect of issues requiring parliamentary approval. Time pressures can mean that proposals will be brought to parliaments for approval when negotiations at EU level are either still in train or just barely concluded.</P>
    <P>The proposal which is the subject of the motion before the House today has been the subject of discussion &ndash; and subject to significant amendment &ndash; over the past two months and only came up for decision at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on Thursday and Friday last, with the objective of it being agreed at the JHA Council. Although the proposal came up for decision on Thursday and Friday last, there was still a significant level of debate resulting in further important amendments to the text &ndash; some made at Ireland's behest &ndash; in an effort to secure overall agreement. The result is that the Dáil and Seanad are being asked to debate texts, the latest version of which only became available yesterday.</P>
    <P>My point in outlining the time pressures involved is not to suggest that Ireland is somehow being hard done by in having to deal with these matters at short notice &ndash; many of our EU partners have the same difficulties &ndash; but that third pillar business is progressing, and is likely to progress, in a way that will require us to look afresh at how we can conduct business efficiently and effectively at EU level, while facilitating the necessary level of oversight and scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Agreement at the JHA Council proved elusive last week in the European arrest warrant but it is necessary, for reasons I shall outline when I come to the detail of the proposal, that the Taoiseach should be able to join the other EU heads of state or government this week in signalling his agreement to the European arrest warrant, on the basis that the prior agreement of the Houses of the Oireachtas has been secured.</P>
    <P>As to why this proposal, and the motion on combating terrorism which is to be debated later today, came before the House, Deputies will be <Col N="887" /> aware of the provisions of Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution which reads:</P>
    <P>The State may exercise the options or discretions provided by or under Articles 1.11, 2.5 and 2.15 of the Treaty referred to in subsection 5º of this section and the second and fourth Protocols set out in the said Treaty, but any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This provision was inserted largely on the basis of concerns which had been expressed by the Labour Party. The understandable concern of the Labour Party in proposing the constitutional provision was that, in respect of certain matters on which the State could exercise an option or discretion, the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas should precede any ministerial agreement. Deputies will be aware that several matters have come before the Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 29.4.6 dealing with asylum and immigration matters and civil law matters.</P>
    <P>It has not been the understanding that matters needed to be brought before the Houses where the relevant Treaty provision referred to actions that fall to be taken by the EU Council of Ministers &ndash; as distinct from actions taken on the basis that they fall within the &ldquo;options or discretions&rdquo; open to the State. The practice, in relation to proposals for framework decisions, for example, which fall to be decided by the JHA Council and involve the approximation of laws, is to seek the advice of the Attorney General as to whether any constitutional issues arise. If a constitutional impediment is identified, the practice is to seek to have the offending provision removed as a pre-condition to ministerial agreement.</P>
    <P>This procedure not only has the advantage of efficiency in dealing with JHA Council business, but of ensuring that constitutional issues are identified and addressed before there is any agreement. Consistent with this approach, our EU partners, once they understood our constitutional difficulties, were invariably prepared to be accommodating in meeting those difficulties. Our partners have been accommodating also in relation to this proposal. Several provisions in the original draft proposal for a European arrest warrant gave rise to concern on constitutional grounds, but important adjustments have been made, so that all but one of these have now been fully addressed.</P>
    <P>I will return to the one remaining issue on which a question might be raised as to constitutionality and I shall commend to the House the proposals as they now stand. The point I make here is that by virtue of the fact that important constitutional issues arose in respect of one of the draft framework decisions now before the House, the Government has decided, having taken the advice of the Attorney General that, while it has not been the norm to refer proposals for Council framework decisions to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the better course would be to bring <Col N="888" /> all proposals for framework decisions before the Houses.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting in Tampere in October 1999 asked the Commission to bring forward a proposal for an arrest warrant. The Commission tabled its proposal in the aftermath of the events of 11 September this year. We discussed the proposed framework decision at the Joint Committee on European Affairs some weeks ago. There has been intensive negotiation since then and the text I have laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas represents what is likely to be the final shape of the decision. Some 14 of the member states, including Ireland, were able to indicate broad agreement on the proposals contained in the present text when the Justice and Home Affairs Council met on Thursday and Friday of last week. I understand that, following further direct bilateral contacts between the remaining member state and the Presidency, the remaining member state is now also in a position to agree to the proposal as currently framed.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a European arrest warrant has at its core the concept of mutual recognition and respect for the judicial processes of the member states of the EU. Based on those concepts, the proposal seeks to simplify procedures to ensure a more efficient system of justice throughout the union. Towards that end, it is proposed to replace among the member states the existing extradition arrangements based on the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition with a simplified surrender procedure. In essence, it replaces the interstate aspects of extradition with an inter-court system. It is important to emphasise that the European arrest warrant applies between EU member states only and that existing arrangements with non-EU states will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>Ireland accepted the need to review current systems in light of the new and devastating threat from international terrorism. However, it was also concerned to ensure that the basic safeguards to protect the individual's rights and liberties were adequately protected. A proper balance needed to be found between the need to protect society at large while retaining the long established safeguards that have been a feature of extradition law heretofore. We have achieved that balance. The general rule set out in the framework decision provides that an arrest warrant may issue in respect of offences with a maximum penalty of at least one year in prison. However, in the case of an offence on a positive list which carries a maximum penalty of at least three years imprisonment, the dual criminality requirement will not apply. The positive list contains 32 of the most serious offences. These include hijacking, terrorism, murder, laundering the proceeds of crime, child pornography, firearms and explosives offences, illicit trafficking in drugs and radioactive materials, and, given our recent sad experiences, it will allow us to deal more effectively with illicit trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> In the case of offences on the positive list, a warrant may issue based on the definition of the offence in the law of the requesting state. As I have indicated, the dual criminality test will no longer apply to offences on the positive list where there is a maximum penalty of at least three years. That is to say, it will no longer be necessary for the court in the requested country to consider whether the offence on which the warrant is based is an offence in both the requesting and the requested State. However, given the seriousness of the offences listed, it is highly improbable that we could be faced with a situation&mdash;</P>

Unfortunately, we have to stay within the hour because other business has been ordered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Howlin for his offer.</P>
      <P>As I stated, it is highly improbable that we could be faced with a situation where we would be surrendering someone for conduct which, if it occurred in Ireland, would not be a serious offence here too. The decision, as now presented, contains many safeguards. I was especially concerned that a person who had been surrendered should not be subject to investigative detention.</P>
      <P>Article 2 is the fundamental part of the proposed directive as it defines its scope. While the arrest warrant will apply to offences punishable by a minimum of 12 months in the issuing state, there is also set out what has been referred to as a positive list of major offences. The list contains 32 such offences. A major offence is one which attracts a penalty of at least three years imprisonment. In the case of these major offences, the offences shall be as defined in the law of the requesting member state but the crucial point is that the court in the requested member state shall not apply the dual criminality test in such cases. This is a departure from current practice but, as I have indicated, we are very likely to find in practice that offences of the kind listed are, in fact, serious offences in all civilised societies. The dual criminality test will continue to apply to all offences other than those major ones to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred earlier to one aspect of the proposed framework decision where a question might be raised as to its implications, constitutionally, for Ireland. The issue arises in the context of the <Col N="890" /> positive list to which I have just referred and the proposal that dual criminality should not apply where a person is sought for an offence on the positive list attracting a term of imprisonment of at least three years in the requesting state. The reliance on the definition of the offence in the law of the requesting state only without any means of establishing the position in the law of the requested state in relation to the same set of events or circumstances, has the effect of ousting the dual criminality test for any such offence. The Attorney General has advised that, in the absence of Dáil and Seanad approval pursuant to Article 29.4.6º of the Constitution, an Irish court would be as likely as not to make a finding of unconstitutionality in such circumstances. Article 29.4.6º gives the appropriate constitutional protection against that risk, although even in the absence of Article 29.4.6º, it would still constitute merely a risk, albeit a substantial one, since there is no conclusive case law on the point.</P>
    <P>I understand my time has elapsed so I will just recommend the draft decision to the House. It is a balanced and measured response on the part of the member states of the European Union to a shocking and entirely unprecedented attack on world peace and stability. It provides a comprehensive set of safeguards for any individual subject to an arrest warrant while providing society at large with a new and effective means of dealing with a most serious threat to the well-being of our democratic systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the motion but I would like to raise a number of matters with the Minister. I start from the same position as the Minister. The reality of the threat posed by international terrorism, if it was ever a mystery, was brought home in extraordinary and horrific circumstances by the events that took place on 11 September last. It is important in the context of this State and the European Union that there is a uniform policy and approach to the threat posed by international terrorism and that we advance the project started with the Amsterdam Treaty, the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, in the context of what I refer to as the third pillar activities in relation to the treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us concerning the directive to provide a common arrest warrant has as its sister or brother proposal the provisions with which we will deal later regarding common offences of terrorism. In the context of tackling these areas and providing for greater uniformity in the European Union, we must ensure we maintain a proper balance between allowing the member states of the European Union to operate in an efficient manner in counteracting the threats posed by terrorists and international criminal gangs while preserving the rights and freedoms which are part and parcel of our constitutional democracy. On occasions, there is a risk that measures brought forward to protect democracy may undermine the very democracy one seeks to protect. I do not believe that is the case with either of the two pro<Col N="891" /> posals we will address but it is important the House considers these issues and deals with them in a cautious, careful and considered manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out very clearly the time frame difficulties that arise in progressing proposals of this nature. The protections provided under Article 29.4.6º of the Constitution are of particular importance. One of the lessons that should have been learned by the failure of the Nice referendum was that the European Union, its institutions and measures put in place by it are, for too many people, seen to be distant from their every day lives. There is a lack of information and understanding of what is taking place. In the context of the national parliaments of the European Union &ndash; this Parliament is not unique in this &ndash; there has been a serious democratic deficit for far too long. If I have any complaint to make about what we are doing today &ndash; it may not be the fault of the Minister &ndash; it is that it is far too rushed. It is important that measures which are needed are put in place but the proposal for a common European Union arrest warrant is one which has been around for some time. It is only the fall-out from the appalling atrocities of 11 September that has resulted in it being given a new dynamic and movement being made by the European Union member states to finalise a proposal that can be put in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the time pressures involved in progressing this and other issues in the future. There is a need for Governments across the European Union, acting as Councils of Ministers and in the context of meetings of prime ministers and heads of state, to look at what new procedures of a functional nature can be put in place to ensure that when a proposal such as this is being progressed, debates in the national parliaments or in the relevant committee of each EU state's national parliament take place far earlier than that which is taking place now so that one can have a more considered debate. Deputy Howlin and myself, representing the main Opposition parties, were presented with two very complex European Union proposals at around five o'clock yesterday evening. We were given some background information but we were given very limited time to have them vetted and to take a detailed and considered view of any difficulties or defects that may arise.</P>
    <P>Effectively, what is presented to us is a <i>fait accompli </i>because we have been told this has been agreed by 14 of the 15 member states. It seems the member state the Minister did not name &ndash; Italy &ndash; which was creating difficulties is now on board for the framework we now have. There is a better way to deal with the democratic deficit and our parliamentary business. It is in the interests of the constitutional and civil rights of people who reside in this State that we take a more considered and timely approach. I hope that when there is a future proposal of this nature, it will be discussed at an earlier point in time so that if we get to the point at which we are now, many of the proposals being taken on <Col N="892" /> board, which have been around for some time, will have been digested previously and considered by this House. If there are amendments to those proposals when a regulation or directive is being finalised, those amendments should be the main issues focused on.</P>
    <P>In the context of dual criminality, the Minister has raised issues pertaining to the Constitution and the uncertainties that arise in that respect. I have nothing to add to what the Minister says about the legal position in that regard. I agree with him that the protections of Article 29.4.8 may ensure that constitutional difficulties do not arise. However, I want to address one particular matter. If what is before the House today is not in any way changed in Laeken and is effectively put in place, then a difficulty should not arise. This is based on the assumption that we pass the motion before this House this afternoon. If it emerges that Italy has a continuing difficulty or that any member state that appeared to have no difficulty last week discovers a new one, and if what is before the House this evening is amended before it is completed, there will be a problem regarding the procedure we are adopting. This is because, in the context of exercising the powers that derive under Article 29.4.6, we would be approving something today that may ultimately be considered differently when negotiations are concluded and all the EU member states sign on for the proposal. The Minister may say it will not happen this time, and perhaps it will not, but it could happen next time with regard to some other issue that needs to be addressed by this House. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that particular issue in his reply.</P>
    <P>It is important that, in the context of the EU, we have the most efficient system of justice possible. In principle, based on the commitment of EU member states and the European Convention on Human Rights and other substantive protections of human rights, there is no particular reason we should not have a simplified surrender procedure for persons who are engaged in the type of activities to which this particular proposal applies. However, we are radically changing our extradition laws. We are, in this evening's very brief debate, throwing out extradition provisions that have applied between this State and other EU member states for many years and rendering irrelevant substantial numbers of very important decisions delivered by our Supreme Court and High Court. It is unfortunate that we do not have more time to consider the implications of that.</P>
    <P>In the context of the particular proposal, I want to refer the Minister to certain matters pertaining thereto so he can reply to them in this very brief debate. Under Article 3, there are provisions that are referred to as grounds for mandatory non-execution. It says the executing judicial authority shall refuse to execute the European arrest warrant in various cases. There are a number of specific cases listed under Article 3.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me the position regarding a lapse of time in effecting a prosecution for a <Col N="893" /> particular case? Great difficulties have been experienced in the area of prosecutions for sexual offences which have been brought very many years after alleged acts have taken place. There have been occasions when the Supreme Court has held that it was inappropriate that a prosecution be taken. There have been other occasions when, due to the delays on the part of the prosecuting authorities in processing prosecutions after their initiation, cases were ultimately terminated by way of judicial order. In the context of the proposals before us which apply to a variety of different offences, will the Minister clarify the position where these provisions are sought to be used for offences that may have been committed in another EU member state 15, 20, 25 or 30 years ago? Is there a timeframe barrier with regard to alleged offences invoking this particular procedure?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister also clarify who or which court is to exercise the judicial authority because it was not clarified in his speech? Is it the High Court? I am presuming it is from what the Minister said, but it is not clear. If it is the High Court, in the context of the timeframes prescribed under this particular proposal within which arrest warrants issued must be implemented, I am doubtful about its current capacity, particularly if there are cases that are appealed from the High Court to the Supreme Court, to meet the limited timeframes prescribed. Currently, there are three significant vacancies within the High Court &ndash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong. We have a Court and Court Officers Bill which will provide for additional appointments. It has no chance of being enacted for a number of months because the Government has not given it priority and has left it sitting as one of the outstanding items among many to be addressed by this House. We were told only yesterday by a member of the High Court that it is incapable in the next couple of months of processing, within a reasonable time, large numbers of cases that are outstanding, including criminal prosecutions. How will the High Court cope with the additional simplified procedures to be applied under this proposal? What thought has the Minister given to that?</P>
    <P>What will the position be with regard to Supreme Court appeals? If a provision is challenged, what priority is the Supreme Court to give to processing any appeal from the High Court? In the context of Article 17 we are told that final decisions on the execution of the European arrest warrant shall be taken with a period of 60 days after the arrest of the required person. What provisions or mechanisms will the Minister put in place to ascertain when this timeframe is or is not being complied with?</P>
    <P>If there is a prosecution for a terrorist type offence in this State as a consequence of crime by a group of individuals in this State, and if those individuals are sought by another European member state pursuant to these new procedures, what will the position be? Will the prosecution in this State always get priority? Under these pro<Col N="894" /> visions, it seems that there are circumstances in which, if two or three different member states are seeking to have someone returned or sent back to those states, whoever applied first will get priority.</P>
    <P>What is the position in this State if we receive an arrest warrant for someone who is alleged to be responsible for a bombing in England and, some days later, our prosecution authorities institute a prosecution against that individual for raiding banks or murdering people in this State? Can our prosecution authorities have priority or will we be compelled to extradite under the new procedures prescribed here? These questions are important and serious. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient time to tease them out. I hope the Minister will address them in his response.</P>

      <P>We have 15 minutes to make a number of general points and, I hope, a few specific points. With regard to the first proposal before us, which relates to the adoption of the European arrest warrant, I will begin like other Members by reflecting on the events of 11 September. Certainly, they have changed our attitudes to issues, many of which were on our agenda in any event. The special Home Affairs Council which was held in Brussels on 20 September sought to bring forward a number of important items that needed to be addressed in any event, in order to create a package. Many of those issues are now speeding rapidly on to our agenda and the agenda of parliaments across the world.</P>
      <P>The proposal to bring in a European arrest warrant is not new, nor is it focused exclusively on terrorism. The Schedule shows that it encompasses a number of serious offences, like trafficking in human beings and child pornography. Those have nothing to do with terrorism but should be the subject of arrest warrants throughout the EU in any event. In a way, the shocking events of 11 September have been the catalyst for expediting a number of proposals which probably should have come forward anyway.</P>
      <P>In dealing with our firm and absolute desire to provide for the safety and security of the citizens of this State and the EU generally, we need a clear balance between the measures needed for such protection and the personal freedoms and liberties enjoyed by citizens. Those rights have been developed in this jurisdiction and the EU over the past 50 years in particular. I am as satisfied as I can be, given the time I have had to examine these proposals, that the balance is reasonable enough in the two measures we are to debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping that balance, the safeguards under Article 6 of the Treaty of European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union are obviously taken into account. I am happy that it is explicit in the framework decision that nothing in the decision would impact on the rights enumerated under the Charter of Fundamental Rights nor the rights to <Col N="895" /> ensure that no European arrest warrant is issued for the purposes of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, sex, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, political opinion or sexual orientation or that that person's position may be prejudiced by any of those reasons. I am happy with the co-decision making of the European Parliament and I have contacted the socialist group, which is content that the balance is reasonable enough in this provision.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I still want to enforce the general principle because other measures will come before us. I am glad we have a Constitution here which does not allow the absolute freedom to Parliament to act in the way it has, for example, in the United Kingdom, bringing in draconian measures which sometimes limit the personal freedoms of individuals. The thrust of the proposals is encapsulated in the suggestion that we are moving largely from what the Minister categorised as an interstate relationship, a formal extradition relationship between sovereign Governments in an EU context, to an intercourt system. That is much more akin or analogous to the interaction between a federation of States as opposed to sovereign States acting in a Government to Government relationship rather than court to court. I have no objection to that as long as those balances and safeguards are encompassed and I am content they are in this measure. I read the list of scheduled offences the Minister has and I saw that, within the directive, there is the wherewithal for the Council at a later stage to broaden the scope of the offences when there is a unanimous decision of the Council and the assent of the European Parliament. It does not cause me great difficulty to have that openness there but there are issues we must look at in the context of the action of Governments and courts within the European Union. I instance the case of Greece, where a number of UK citizens are subject to judicial proceedings under Greek law. They are being charged with espionage because they photographed a Greek military air display and I am concerned that the standards and norms we expect to be the judicial norm across the EU should apply to all. I do not want to comment on the merits or demerits of this case, though I have the gravest concerns about those charges. It could be an Irish citizen subject to an extradition warrant under this agreement in the future for taking holiday photographs of installations about which a Government like the Government of Greece is sensitive. That would cause me concern and the Minister should address it in his response.</P>
    <P>I do not know if, subsequent to the acquiescence of the Italian Government, the draft Council statement has become an actual Council statement but the draft circulated to us last night stated:</P>
    <P>The Council states that the framework decision on the fight against terrorism covers acts which are considered by all member states of the European Union as serious infringement <Col N="896" /> of their criminal laws committed by individuals whose objectives constitute a threat to the democratic societies, respecting the rule of law and the civilisation upon which those societies are founded.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important statement because it is simply not good enough to classify as terrorism acts which may be against a Government but which are meant to protect values of civilisation and democracy that are important. Section 2 of the draft Council statement states that it is understood that it:</P>
    <P>. . . cannot be construed so as to argue that the conduct of those who have acted in the interests of preserving or restoring these democratic values, as was notably the case in some member states during the Second World War, could now be considered as terrorist acts, nor can it be construed so as to incriminate on terrorist grounds persons exercising their fundamental rights to manifest their opinions, even if in the course of the exercise of such rights they commit offences.</P>
    <P>That statement gives me the confidence to support the resolutions before us, as it seeks a balance between the duty of any society to defend itself and its citizens with protecting the rights of citizens to protest and take militant action, if necessary, to ventilate their concerns with particular actions of Government. It should not be an untrammelled right of Government to protect itself at the expense of the civil liberty of every citizen to protest with any legitimate means.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to parliamentary scrutiny and responsibilities under Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution. I welcome his commitment that all framework decisions will now, regardless of the advice of the Attorney General, I presume, be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I have commented on this in relation to a number of issues and I agree with Deputy Shatter. Despite our acquiescence today, it is not good enough that we got 50 pages through our fax machines last night when we are already busy doing other parliamentary work and that we are expected to make reasonable comment on them today. I am not blaming anyone for that as the time frame was impossible for the Minister also when the draft was not finalised last weekend and texts are still fluid. Regardless of the decision this House will make today, it is technically possible for the text of this directive to be changed as it has not been agreed by Council. I understand that this matter is to go before the Heads of Government at their meeting in Laeken this weekend, so the text could be changed then, despite the fact that we may have passed this motion. It is unlikely, but it is theoretically possible.</P>
    <P>This House should adopt the procedure used in the Danish Parliament and in other legislatures. We should be able to discuss draft framework decisions in committees of the House and the relevant Minister should take advice from <Col N="897" /> those involved, including members of the committee and external groups invited to contribute. The opinions of groups like the new Human Rights Commission and the Irish Council of Civil Liberties should be valued. There is not much use in allowing such groups to contribute or make submissions subsequent to the enactment of the decisions.</P>
    <P>The Dáil can vote against these proposals today but Parliament is not entitled to amend them as they have been agreed by 14 of the 15 member states and they have been formally supported by Ireland at the Council of Ministers. I commend the Minister for the line he took at the meeting and many useful changes were made as a result of his actions and those of the Attorney General who, I understand, took a particular interest in this matter. I regret the fact that the involvement of the Oireachtas in parliamentary scrutiny, as a matter of general principle, is not taken seriously. I hope we can do better in the future.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of time as I know other Deputies wish to contribute, so I will conclude by saying that I think a reasonable balance has been struck as regards the European arrest warrant. I have set out my stall of concerns, but I have no difficulty indicating the Labour Party's support for this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion on the draft framework decision on the European arrest warrant and I am glad that the matter is being debated in this House. Like many other speakers, however, I regret that we have been given only 60 minutes to discuss an issue of fundamental importance, although I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department. Great work has been done in recent months to bring the draft framework decision to its present state. I agree with the amendments that were made in Brussels recently, at Ireland's suggestion. Ireland and the United Kingdom do not share the tradition of detention for the purposes of investigation which is found in the criminal legal systems of other countries . It would be very difficult to marry the system we employ with that used by many European countries, so it is better that it will not apply. I am not criticising the manner in which these matters are conducted in other countries, however, as we may need to adopt similar provisions in the fullness of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extensive list of offences to which this directive will apply is found in paragraph 2 of article 2. Some of the offences need to be a little more clearly defined, as some of them hardly warrant the use of a European arrest warrant. While arson can be a serious offence, there has to be a limit of its scale below which the rigours of this framework will not apply. If someone burns a bale of hay, for example, it is doubtful if the European arrest warrant should be issued. I do not know what is envisaged in the document as regards swindling as such a crime does not exist <Col N="898" /> in Irish law. A multitude of misdemeanours could be covered under such a heading. I doubt, however, if the guardians of the European justice system should be concerned with those who practise the art of the three card trick at point-to-point meetings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <P>I am afraid I did not get that far as I only received the document from the Department of Foreign Affairs at about nine o'clock last night. I could not get it anywhere else. It is difficult, at this busy time of year, to read and assimilate large documents such as this one, and it has been impossible to receive advice on the issues involved.</P>
      <P>Another section of the document refers to the crime of &ldquo;the facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence&rdquo;. I do not know what that means and I am unsure how one could facilitate unauthorised residence. It reminds me of a favourite old Act of mine, the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, about which we do not hear much now but which caused great consternation in this House at the time.</P>
      <P>The significance of this framework decision is that it effectively replaces virtually our entire system of extradition&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;beginning with the Extradition Act, 1965, which was based on a 1957 Council of Europe convention. I think it is true to say that the provisions of the framework decision will replace most of the extradition legislation of members of the Council of Europe. In the case of Ireland, the 1965 Act as amended by at least three or four Acts since then, will be replaced. The only arrangements that will not be affected are the extradition treaties we have with the United States and Australia, the only countries outside Europe with which we have arrangements. Our relationship with European countries will vastly change if we approve this framework directive which, in effect, repeals the 1965 and subsequent Acts. It does not repeal them overnight, however, as the new system does not have to come into effect until 1 January 2004, which allows just over two years for the Irish Government to prepare legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the rather empty and passionless Chamber for this motion, I recall the days when extradition Bills, which were minor in comparison with this motion, were before the House for days, weeks or months. Members argued that the legislation would lead to the most appalling breaches of human rights and that the world would virtually come to a halt if the legislation was passed. One of the amazing by-products of the events of 11 September is that those who sometimes show <Col N="899" /> concern for terrorists, among others, are much less vocal than they were.</P>
    <P>Among the list of crimes in article 2 of this directive is &ldquo;motor vehicle crime&rdquo;, which needs to be defined properly. I am a little nervous when I encounter such vague terms as in this case it may mean that the European arrest warrant could be used to capture someone without motor taxation or someone who drove at a speed in excess of the speed limit. I know the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, will probably tell us that the warrant will not be used in such circumstances, but there is nothing to stop it from being used, depending on how the directive is fleshed out in the years to come. I am quite happy to take such matters on faith, however, as the approach of the Minister, his Department and the European Union seems to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister's speech referred to an academic commentator who believes that recent progress in what we call the third pillar has been amazing. The progress is amazing and commendable. It is a major development for the EU that we are no longer primarily an economic community and that the Union is dealing as best it can, and with some success, with problems which arise for its citizens with regard to fundamental personal matters such as their safety and protection from terrorism and terrorists. We should mark this framework as a major step along that road. The thanks of all citizens are due to the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers and their officials who have successfully and rapidly negotiated, discussed and amended this draft in the past number of months.</P>
    <P>I welcome the news in the Minister's speech, of which I was not aware, that Italy has withdrawn its reservation, veto or whatever one wishes to call it regarding this matter and that, in common with the other 14 member states, it will be able to go along with the framework. However, I would wish to see this framework come back to the House in its final form. Will the Minister outline whether this will be done by motion or through legislation which would have to be introduced? The House should get an opportunity to debate the framework decision when finalised and to do so in more detail and with more notice than was available on this occasion.</P>

      <P>As regards a point made by Deputy Shatter, if the proposed framework decision changes we would have to come back to the House. Approval can only apply to the information which is currently available. A minor linguistic change at the summit would not require us to come back to the House, but we would have to do so if there was a substantive change.</P>
      <P>The issue of the lapse of time is dealt with in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union which refers to the Union respecting fundamental rights. As regards the High Court, time limits are not prescriptive. Additional judges are required for the High Court and the Government will deal with this matter shortly. There are vacancies and the courts are experiencing difficulties. We will try to fill the vacancies as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Article 19.1 deals with the issue of priority. Article 26.1 deals with the issue of how far back it goes. The commencement date is 2004. Deputy Howlin referred to the fact that we have not been able to discuss this issue properly in the House. I agree that the timeframe is short, which causes difficulties for contributors. We had the opportunity to discuss the framework decision at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs some weeks ago, but I am aware that neither of the main spokespersons are members of that committee and did not have occasion to attend the meeting. We held a brief discussion on the matter at the request of Deputy John Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley inquired as to whether there is a draft directive on unauthorised entry. There is such a directive. The Deputy also inquired about the definition. I was concerned during the negotiations about the absence of sufficient definitions of certain offences which could lead to constitutional difficulties for us in the context of dual criminality. Therefore, after protracted negotiations the Council agreed that we would have definitions regarding certain offences including racism and xenophobia, sabotage and racketeering and extortion. We asked that swindling for this purpose be also defined and this <Col N="901" /> proposal was agreed to. Indicators will be provided in terms of the definition of these offences.</P>
    <P>In that context, we also put forward the case that investigative detention, to which Deputy O'Malley also referred, would not be tolerated. In the interests of greater certainty and clarity it was agreed that Ireland would be allowed a declaration to this effect, and that is contained in the agreement.</P>
    <P>We also had reservations regarding specialty. Our arguments were successful in this regard as they were concerning a number of other matters.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion provided by Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam to take part in the adoption of the following proposed measure:</P>
      <P>a proposal for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism,</P>
      <P>a copy of which proposed measure was laid before Dáil Éireann on 11 December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative for the framework decision on combating terrorism came from the European Commission in advance of the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers which met on 20 September. The JHA Council, in welcoming the proposal, emphasised the need for a common understanding of what terrorism means in order to facilitate cross-border co-operation. The Council <Col N="902" /> also instructed senior officials to take forward work urgently so as to enable the Council achieve significant political agreement at its meeting last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council meeting on 21 September endorsed that approach signifying, in particular, its agreement to the adoption of a common definition of terrorism and asking the JHA Council to flesh out that agreement.</P>
      <P>Work has progressed within the framework of title six of the Treaty on European Union on the proposed framework decision. That work has been undertaken in the main by the co-ordinating Article 36 committee and Coreper. It also involved two further meetings of the JHA Council, on 16 October and 16 November, prior to last week's meeting on 6 and 7 December. Negotiations continued right up to and during that Council meeting at which political agreement was achieved on the text in the terms in which it has been laid before this House. That agreement is provisional in that the text is subject to parliamentary scrutiny reservations by Sweden and Denmark, as well as Ireland, and further consultation by the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the proposed framework decision is to approximate member states' legislation on terrorism in accordance with Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union thus facilitating co-operation between member states at a number of levels. Article 34(2)(f2&gt;b) provides that the Council may, acting unanimously on the initiative of any member state or of the Commission, adopt framework decisions for the purpose of the approximation of the laws and regulations of the member states. It also provides that framework decisions shall be binding upon member states as to the result to be achieved but shall leave to national authorities the choice of form and methods and that they do not entail direct effect.</P>
      <P>The proposed framework decision on combating terrorism will approximate member states' legislation, in particular by establishing a common definition of a terrorist act and laying down common criminal sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions which it makes for this purpose are explicitly stated in Article 1(f2&gt;b) as not being intended to amend the obligation to respect the fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. I envisage implementation of the proposed framework decision being achieved by way of primary legislation which will be brought before the House in the coming year. I intend that legislation will, in addition to addressing the specific requirements arising from the <Col N="903" /> proposed framework decision itself to which I have already referred, also be directed to making any further changes to our law judged necessary for the purposes of dealing with international terrorism. I do not consider that the implementing legislation should present difficulties. Ireland's experience in combating terrorism means that our existing legislation in this regard is more comprehensive than the provisions of this proposal.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September represented a defining moment for the world. Few events have demonstrated so starkly the choice between good and evil as the attacks perpetrated that day in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania by the forces of international terrorism. I am determined that Ireland will respond decisively and comprehensively to the challenge which those events represent and that will be my aim in framing the legislative proposals needed to give effect to the proposed framework decision and related issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As with the previous motion, Fine Gael supports this proposal. I welcome the framework document and the opportunity to discuss it. On the assumption that this will be adopted by the EU member states, the framework decision will require substantial changes in our criminal law. In future, when dealing with matters of this nature, it would be helpful to the House if a detailed background document be made available to at least delineate, from a preliminary view, each of the statutory provisions that might be affected and the criminal law amendments that might be required. That is a matter to which we should return.</P>
      <P>I ask that, following the Council framework decision being formally made, the Minister arrange to have a document laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas detailing the statutory changes envisaged to allow us implement our obligations under the framework document.</P>
      <P>Terrorism is something with which we are familiar. For too many years we have had our own domestic brand of terrorism with the IRA, the Real IRA and the Provisional IRA and we still have problems with terrorism and private armies in the context of republican and loyalist groups. At a time when we are addressing our own problems, it is ironic that there is to be a common European approach which is a direct consequence of the horrendous acts of 11 September. The approach provided for here should not simply relate to addressing issues of terrorism to the relationships between the member states of the European Union. Rather, the principles prescribed under the framework decision should provide a fundamental bedrock that should inform not just internal European relationships but the way in which EU countries manage their external and foreign relationships. This is particularly important.</P>
      <P>Article 1 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each member state shall take the necessary measures to ensure that terrorist offences <Col N="904" /> include the following list of intentional acts which, given their nature or their context, may seriously damage a country or an international organisation as defined as offences under national law where committed with the aim of i) seriously intimidating a population, ii) unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform, or abstain from performing, any act, iii) seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or international organisation by: attacks upon a person's life which may cause death, attacks upon the physical integrity of a person, kidnapping or hostage taking, causing extensive destruction to a government or public facility, a transport system, an infrastructural facility (including information system), a fixed platform located on the continental shelf, a public place or private property likely to endanger human life or result in major economic loss; seizure of aircraft, ship or other means of public or goods transport.</P>
    <P>It continues with further instances that can constitute terrorist acts. In the context of a united EU approach, we should not adopt a blinkered approach. It is interesting to observe the diversity of views expressed by EU members.</P>
    <P>Regarding the terrorist acts to which the Israeli State is being subjected on a daily basis, we are proposing prescriptions in relation to the resolution of the problems in the Middle East that frequently are not based on the reality of what the people there are experiencing but on the perception of how we in the EU should deal with terrorist acts should we be subjected to them. For the purpose of this framework decision and the way in which the EU views terrorist acts committed by terrorist groups outside the EU, I suggest a comprehensive definition of terrorist offences be agreed by the Union. This is a particularly important issue in light of what happened on 11 September in the context of the difficulties affecting not just the member states of the European Union, in so far as they may be under threat from international terrorism, but in the context of the difficulties affecting states outside the EU.</P>
    <P>I presume this House cannot change any element of the framework decision before us, but I will highlight some issues. The definition of a terrorist group as contained in Article 2 seems to be a tortuous one. I do not have time to recite the definition but it states that a terrorist group means a structured group of more than two persons. Why would two persons who commit acts of terrorism be excluded from this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very strange dividing line. If three people blow up a building and kill 20 people they fall within the context of being a terrorist group, whereas, if two people do it and no third person involvement can be proved, they are not regarded as a terrorist group under this pro<Col N="905" /> vision. I would like an explanation for that definition.</P>
      <P>There are provisions here arising out of Article 2 and other Articles which may require this State to create new offences. I already raised the issue of amending existing criminal law and the second issue I wish to raise relates to any document that may be laid before the House. We should get some insight from the Minister as to what new legislation may be required to create new criminal offences to comply with our obligations under the framework decision.</P>
      <P>In the context of dealing with terrorism and terrorist groups as provided for under the framework decision, there are certain prescriptions about the type of sentences that might be imposed for certain offences, with minimum and maximum terms laid down. This proposal does not provide for a harmonisation of offences and sentencing throughout the EU. The next step in dealing with this issue, by way of implementation, would be to have a uniform definition of particular offences, and prescribed maximum sentences across the EU. I would be interested in the Minister commenting on that. It would be a complicated thing to do and may not be achievable in the time frame prescribed. It should be on the agenda, in the context of what is now proposed, under the third pillar.</P>
      <P>I hope that would also ensure a uniformity of approach by the courts in the different states in the imposition of sentences for those who are convicted of terrorist offences and for the determination of whether particular acts alleged to be offences are offences. There is a danger in the implementation of this, because domestic legislation in each of the countries of the EU can vary and what might be properly defined as an offence falling within this framework may not be so regarded due to difficulties in legislative drafting and linguistics.</P>
      <P>It is important that this framework decision is implemented. I understand that Italy does not have a difficulty with this either and the Minister might confirm that. In the context of the implementation process, as well as having the documentation that I mentioned, I hope the Minister might come to the Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Committee to discuss measures being taken and the expected time frame in implementing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure is perceived by the State and other members of the EU as a rational and considered response to the events of 11 September. Democracies have an obligation to take such steps as are necessary to protect themselves from those who commit terrorist acts and try to destroy the freedoms available within a democracy. We have an obligation at EU level using the third pillar powers to take the type of action that is being taken here. As a Member of this Dáil I regret that it has taken the tragic events of 11 September to focus the minds of the member governments of the EU to this degree on the need for co-operation in these areas. I admit that it could not have <Col N="906" /> been done effectively without the Amsterdam Treaty, but in the context of the difficulties this State has experienced over the past 30 years, greater co-operation could have been achieved in dealing with certain issues from other EU member states if the terrorist difficulties that we experienced had been given a higher priority.</P>
    <P>The enormity of what happened on 11 September brought home the reality of the appalling consequences that international terrorist groups can bring about &ndash; the death, destruction and mayhem that can result from acts by people of fundamentalist views who have no concern for the human carnage they create whilst they try to achieve objectives that are alien to all right thinking people. This House, in taking this measure today, is responding to the events of 11 September but, as both Deputy Howlin and I said on the last motion, it is regrettable that we need to deal with this issue with this level of speed in a very limited debate without Members of the House having an opportunity to get views from bodies such as our Human Rights Commission about the substance of what is being proposed. I hope, when it comes to the enactment of the new legislation that will be required, there will be greater space and time for consultation and for Members of this House to consider proposals in Bill form before they are processed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I do not intend to oppose this resolution although I enter the caveat that I made in the previous discussion that I regret we have not had more opportunity to read the draft texts, debate them and get views from external parties. There are many who would like an input in this debate in advance of it being a <i>fait accompli</i>. We need to reform parliamentary scrutiny. The notion that there is no parliamentary scrutiny of these matters until they are decided by Council is not the norm. It is not the way other parliaments do business and I would have liked to have had some input into the discussion before the Council meeting so that the Minister could go to Council armed with the views of a cross section of this Dáil and whatever final decisions he would make would be strengthened by the debate in committee or in the plenary of this House.</P>
      <P>Fundamental changes in attitude have taken place since 11 September and reading the Justice and Home Affairs Council conclusions on the Brussels summit of 20 September, we see a raft of proposals that presumably will come before us in future. A broader explanation of what exactly is happening is required to ensure a correct balance between, on the one hand, the resolute action against terrorism to ensure there is no repetition of the awful events of 11 September that might befall any country and, on the other hand, the fundamental freedoms European citizens enjoy under the European Union treaties and conventions, including the freedoms we enjoy in this jurisdiction under the Constitution which are often defined by the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> When the Justice and Home Affairs Council of Ministers refers to the convention on mutual assistance and criminal matters we need to know how that is progressing. The establishment of the EU police chiefs' task force, the notion of co-operation between police and intelligence services to counter terrorism across the EU and the establishment of an EU counter terrorist unit were suggestions made by the Council of Ministers last September. The House requires much fuller explanations on what progress has been made in our name so we can ensure that whatever organs of the State, be it police or security, involved in establishing European wide scrutiny, investigations or co-operation, act in a way that is consistent with our values, beliefs and laws.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter suggested that with the possible exception of Spain, Ireland is more used to dealing with terrorism issues because of the domestic terrorism we have endured with terrible consequences over the past 20 to 30 years. Unfortunately, we were required to enact severe legislation, including the Offences against the State Acts and the establishment of the Special Criminal Court. The Government introduced new offences in what it described as draconian legislation after the Omagh outrage. It was considered necessary to tackle domestic terrorism. In terms of strengthening anti-terrorist measures we have a base of laws that probably goes further than most European Union law.</P>
    <P>A new dimension is the international co-operation on terrorism to deal with organisations, such as Al-Qaeda, which uses a world-wide matrix to launder money, perhaps through financial institutions in this country, recruit expertise, train and plant people, procure different components for weaponry and so on. A framework of international co-operation is required to deal with this in a structured way. Given this, I have no difficulty with many of the proposals contained in the draft framework directive, although they are underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>I have grave concerns about the generalities involved in what is the prime issue of the definition of a terrorist offence. We will await the draft legislation the Minister has promised to introduce next year to see if we can, in a structured way, spell out what specifically constitutes terrorism. It will take a long time to get an agreed definition. Suggestions such as &ldquo;seriously intimidating a population&rdquo; and &ldquo;unduly compelling a Government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act&rdquo; are too vague. Every day, organisations seek to compel the Government to perform or abstain from performing an act. Protest groups outside the House today &ndash; I met two of them &ndash; are trying to compel the Government to perform an act or refrain from performing one. It would be absurd to delimit the right of people to protest. I hope the rights enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty of European Union will not be delimited by the structure to oppose terrorism envisaged in this <Col N="908" /> draft directive. Article 1(f2&gt;b) provides that the framework decision shall not have the effect of amending the obligation to respect fundamental rights and legal principles enshrined in Article 6 and I am happy to rely on that as accepting the norms of rights that have been developed within the EU and among the member states. I look forward to the primary legislation so that we can debate this issue in a more structure manner. The framework motion requires us to consider it in a much more general way.</P>
    <P>Many in this House, including my party members, would not share Deputy Shatter's view on the reaction of Israel to the Palestinian Authority. We are deeply shocked by the aggressive over-reaction by Israel, which only now can be seen as a determined effort by it to destroy the Palestinian Authority. We all abhor the acts of aggression perpetrated by terrorist groups through the use of suicide bombers that have slaughtered innocent people in Israel but the action of its lawful Government has not been measured or balanced.</P>
    <P>Post 11 September, we are all shocked at the structured existence of international terrorism. It is clear that Al-Qaeda is one manifestation but there are others. As democrats, we cannot sit idly by while our democratic structures are attacked in the way the attacks on the US were used to strike a body blow against democracy. We need resources on a cross-national and multi-national basis to deal with the transfer of money, resources and weaponry in which these terrorists organisations engage. However, we must balance this against the fundamental rights and freedoms of people to engage in lawful protest and to challenge lawful authority in a democratic, structured and rational way.</P>
    <P>While accepting the need for this framework directive, the ensuing legislation will require careful analysis in this House. The pattern of rushing many of these proposals in the aftermath of 11 September through the Justice and Home Affairs Council of Ministers last week to the Heads of Government Council meeting to take place this weekend, with very little time for parliaments to debate them, is not a good way to deal with such matters. I hope it will not be a precedent for the way we deal with them in future. However, the Labour Party will not object to the adoption of this resolution.</P>

      <P>I oppose this measure because I subscribe to the principle that one should not buy a pig in a poke. I have not read enough about this measure, I do not know enough about it and I suspect that many Members are in a similar situation. Those who claim expertise may not be tell<Col N="909" /> ing the full truth as they cannot have had this document more than a few days ago. I have not had the opportunity to discuss it with other people. I wish to put on record that I am totally opposed to terrorism. I was horrified by the events of 11 September and unequivocally condemned those terrorist acts as I condemned terrorist acts committed by the Provisional IRA and other terrorist groups in this country.</P>
      <P>The manner in which this so-called debate is being conducted is an affront to democracy. Rushed measures are very often bad measures. A knee-jerk reaction as a result of what happened on 11 September will result in bad legislation and a rolling back of hard won civil liberties throughout Europe. This issue relates to the development of a European Union justice platform. It is a matter which the Green Party has been discussing for some time. Increasingly, justice legislation emanating from Brussels does not get the required debate in this House and very often citizens do not know what is happening. Indeed, elected representatives in this House do not know very often what is emerging from Councils of Ministers. We said, during the Nice treaty debate, that there ought to be a very different way of dealing with Council of Ministers meetings, which should be subject to debate in this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Labour Party has produced a Bill, which we fully support, in relation to the European Union. Clearly, this is a case in point. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is consulting his EU colleagues and it appears that Mr. Berlesconi has certain reservations, but they are talking among themselves. What role is there for parliamentarians in the national Parliaments in this matter? It seems we are very much a side issue although very important measures are being discussed.</P>
      <P>While the events of 11 September were horrendous, we in this country also experienced horrendous events but we did not react in this way. There can be no rush to judgment as that will, unquestionably, lead to repercussions down the line. The issue of terrorism is a vexed question. I listened with interest to Deputy Shatter's interpretation of events in the Middle East. There have been suicide bombers and other acts of terrorism, but is the bombing of Yasser Arafat's compound not an act of terrorism? Under this framework document, that would be regarded as an act of terrorism if carried out by a group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 9 will require member states to ensure that they have jurisdiction in respect of offences relating to a terrorist group that is directing or knowingly participating in a terrorist group or inciting, aiding and abetting and attempting to commit terrorist offences where such offences have been committed in whole or in part within its territory and irrespective of where the terrorist group is based or pursues its criminal activities. The key words are &ldquo;inciting, aiding and abetting&rdquo;. It is clear that over very many years the CIA incited, aided and abetted terrorist groups throughout the world. That is a fact. We need to <Col N="910" /> look at the involvement of states themselves in what I call terrorist activity. That has not been looked at in any great detail. It is generally assumed that a state cannot commit terrorist actions. I do not agree in any way with that assumption.</P>
    <P>The definition refers to &ldquo;causing extensive damage to Government property&rdquo;. What does that mean? Does it mean putting a brick through a window or graffiti on a wall? To what precisely does it refer? We know of groups which have engaged in protest. Following the shooting dead of protesters in Derry, a large group went to the British Embassy in Dublin and gave vent to their anger by burning down that building. Those people would be deemed terrorists but it could also involve a lesser event, such as disruption of transport systems as a result of a sit-down protest. For example, Deputy Howlin was engaged in such a protest in Wexford at the time of the Carnsore demonstrations. Would he be guilty of terrorism? I am deeply afraid that such broad definitions will be abused because, as we have seen in the past, legislation which is introduced in this way can be abused. Computer crime also causes damage to Government. Is a young computer hacker a terrorist? </P>
    <P>Probably for the best of intentions, people are trying to rush measures through but I believe any such rush to judgment will result in serious long-term consequences for our civil liberties throughout Europe. For that reason alone, I will oppose this measure. It is likely we will not get the requisite numbers for a vote but, as a matter of principle, we will take a stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this motion. I deplore the fact that, once again, as with the European arrest warrant, the Government is asking the Dáil to act as a rubber stamp on a proposal which has huge implications for civil rights in this country and throughout the European Union. I only had sight of the proposal cited in this motion this morning. It was not even circulated to all Deputies and my office had to request a copy from the Library. It is a detailed and legally complex document which was only laid before the Dáil yesterday. Yet today we are expected to nod it through without any proper scrutiny or debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject matter of the document is a proposal for &ldquo;Adoption of a Council Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism&rdquo;. One needs to consider much of the text of this document very carefully. It is, of course, reactive and, in that, it is certainly flawed. Article 2 refers to &ldquo;offences relating to a terrorist group&rdquo;. An earlier speaker also referred to this. It states that &ldquo;a terrorist group shall mean a structured group of more than two persons, established over a period of time and acting in concert to commit terrorist offences&rdquo;. Many will recognise very different realities in reading that definition. Indeed, the victims of British state violence in Ireland will have a very clear view of where this definition <Col N="911" /> aptly applies. Article 1, under so-called terrorist offences, states that &ldquo;each member state shall take the necessary measures to ensure that terrorist offences include the following list of intentional acts . . . .&rdquo;  No. 1 refers to &ldquo;seriously intimidating a population&rdquo;. No. 3 refers to &ldquo;seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country.&rdquo; That section of the article also refers to the manufacture, possession, acquisition, transport, supply or use of weapons, explosives or of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons as well as research into and development of the latter.</P>
    <P>Where do we recognise the realities &ndash; such as seriously intimidating a population, seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country &ndash; to which these sections refer? We must accept that this document fails and refuses to recognise the existence of state terrorism. Article 1 also refers to &ldquo;unduly compelling a Government . . . to perform or abstain from performing any act&rdquo;. I do not want to be light hearted about this subject, but would the efforts of the &ldquo;famous four&rdquo; in this House be seen as tantamount to unduly compelling the Government?</P>
    <P>On the basis of one clause alone, this Council framework decision on combating terrorism should be thrown out. Item 11 effectively rules out the concept of state terrorism by stating that &ldquo;Actions by the armed forces of a state in the exercise of their official duties are not governed by this framework document.&rdquo; At the same time a wide-ranging definition of terrorism is provided and this includes &ldquo;causing extensive destruction to a Government or public facility&rdquo;. By this definition, the British Army's murder of 14 people on Bloody Sunday would not be terrorism. However, the burning of the British Embassy in Dublin would be terrorism. In Britain and the Six Counties, catch-all conspiracy laws have been used to trample upon the rights of citizens and were the cause of major miscarriages of justice. This measure paves the way for similar injustices.</P>
    <P>I have, without reservation, condemned what happened in New York on 11 September and I am totally committed, as I have stated on many occasions, to the removal of arms and armed organisations from the political equation on this island and between it and its near neighbour. I have no doubt this and previous reactive measures have made and will make no difference to those who are committed to carrying out armed actions or actions of violence. What we clearly need to do is to grapple with the causes of these actions of violence. That is the issue which needs to be addressed. If the time, effort and energy expended on this ever-increasing raft of legislative reactive measures was employed more properly in addressing the core causes and injustices, both domestically and internationally, we would see a significant improvement in the situation here in Ireland and across the globe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> I will also be opposing this motion. I call on all Members to recognise that this is a flawed approach to very important business.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I vehemently protest about pushing through the Dáil &ndash; with one hour's debate in each case &ndash; this measure on combating terrorism and that which relates to the European extradition warrant. These are far-reaching measures and it would be incredible if the Dáil agreed to pass them without examining and scrutinising them properly. If the Dáil passes both motions, it may rebound on the heads of those who support their rapid passage in the future in ways they may not foresee. The raft of legislation and other measures coming before the House in recent weeks are being opportunistically pushed through in the wake of the atrocity of 11 September. That atrocity is being used to justify measures which would not normally pass muster and which certainly would not usually be pushed through with the haste being employed here this evening.</P>
      <P>Across the Atlantic, the situation is even more exaggerated. Provision has already been made there for military tribunals to try, in secret, people &ndash; of whom there are approximately 20 million at present &ndash; who are not citizens of the United States. These tribunals have been empowered to pass a sentence of execution on people who have no right to appeal. The Government in Britain is attempting to introduce what virtually amounts to internment without trial. There has even been a debate in the United States about whether torture should be legitimised within that country's security systems.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that all the major parties in this House are willing to go along with the panic measures we are being asked to pass today. I am seriously concerned about these measures, particularly in terms of the way they can be interpreted. I have no doubt they can be used to criminalise the anti-globalisation, anti-capitalist movement that is growing apace in Europe. I attended protest meetings in Gothenburg, Sweden, at which tens of thousands of people were present, on the occasion of the summit held there earlier this year. I personally witnessed the deliberate provocation by sections of the police of protesters who set out to be peaceful. However, a number of them did not remain peaceful when provoked in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to violent demonstrations because they are counterproductive in every sense. However, article 1 of the draft framework decision refers to &ldquo;causing extensive destruction to a public facility&rdquo;. Sit-down protests and peaceful occupations have traditionally been used by those opposed to government measures or policies to make their point in certain cases. Under the decision, this provision can be extended to cover such protests. It is stated that the word &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; is used as in the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Unfortunately, we received the draft framework <Col N="913" /> decision document only 24 hours ago. However, I could not find the definition to which it refers in the convention. Will the Minister read it aloud to the House when replying to the debate?</P>
    <P>The provision which refers to &ldquo;unduly compelling a Government . . . to perform or abstain from performing any act&rdquo; can also be extended to cover, for example, what the anti-globalisation movement has set out to do, namely, fundamentally change &ndash; in a peaceful way as far as the majority of its members are concerned &ndash; the structures of the European Union and some of its policies, such that which relates to the privatisation of public services. Undoubtedly, this will be used by the types of Governments that orchestrated the violent police actions in Gothenburg in Sweden and in Genoa in Italy earlier this year against mass movements of the peoples of Europe.</P>
    <P>Another question is the narrow definition of terrorism that is envisaged within the measures being put through here today. I and my party, the Socialist Party, are, and always have been, opposed to terrorist methods. This is a one-sided definition of terrorism. What is being visited on the innocent and suffering people and children of Iraq by the sanctions imposed by the United States, Britain and other states is terrorism. That is causing incredible misery. It has caused the deaths of perhaps half a million people in the course of the past ten years. This incredible terrorism being perpetrated by the richest countries on earth against one of the poorer countries on earth is totally ignored here, as indeed is the terror being visited by the Israeli state on the long-suffering Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the suicide bombing tactic and the suffering and destruction it causes. However, it is incredible to hear a member of the Dáil refer, as Deputy Shatter did, to the Palestinian terror without referring to the policy of murder and assassination being carried out deliberately by the Israeli state with the approval of the United States and Britain. It has not been publicly condemned. Here is a state that is setting out to murder people without any process and slaughtering little children in the process, and we have absolute silence as far as the countries that want to have these measures hammered into their laws are concerned. We have here a completely one-sided approach to the situation and nothing whatsoever to address the horrific economic and social conditions and the barbarism that is imposed on millions of people in the poorest countries on earth and from which arise generally some groups that mistakenly or misguidedly and in a counter-productive and reactionary fashion engage in acts of terrorism.</P>
    <P>We had the spectacle some months ago of General Augusto Pinochet arrested in Britain. Mr. Blair, who says he is crusading against terror around the world, had a proven mass murderer in his grasp &ndash; Pinochet, the mass murderer from the 1973 coup carried out in Chile with the connivance and support of the American CIA and <Col N="914" /> others in defence of multinational corporations and their interest &ndash; and assisted him in going safely back to Chile instead of having him put on trial for the crimes he carried out. What we have here is another monumental exercise in hypocrisy by the western Governments, and typically this Government, which absolutely must not in its own mind go against the policies of the United States, or Britain for that matter, is going along with it.</P>
    <P>This is a bad day's work. Even at this stage I call on the Dáil to reject this measure and to have further debate on these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed on this important motion. I am gratified, although not greatly surprised, at the consensus on the need for concerted strong and effective action to combat international terrorism so that we may ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that the horrific scenes such as those we all witnessed on 11 September will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>This proposal for the framework decision on combating terrorism is proof positive of the ability of the European Union's member states to act together in a decisive manner to uphold the democratic values common to us and to further the Union's stated aim of creating an area of freedom, security and justice for all its citizens. Unfortunately, we in Ireland have had long experience of dealing with terrorism. We have been able to contribute, therefore, in a positive way to the development of this proposed framework decision and it has helped us to develop these proposals into effective tools which can be used against those who engage in or assist terrorism.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to enact legislation to give effect to this proposed framework decision in due course. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated at the outset, this should not present great difficulties as Ireland's legislation is in any event very comprehensive as it stands.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, this House passed the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act. In legal terms it represented a significant enhancement of the previous offences against the State legislation. In moral terms it represented our determination to protect lives and democracy itself. It is the case that the capacity of the criminal law to respond to atrocities such as that in Omagh is kept under constant review in the light of experience, and the Government will not hesitate in bringing to this House further proposals it considers necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposed framework decision which is before the House is only one measure, albeit a significant one, that has been taken at European level to combat terrorism. The European Council held an extraordinary meeting on 21 September to consider measures to progress the fight against international terrorism and set out a plan of <Col N="915" /> action which included the introduction of the European Arrest Warrant, a measure already discussed, and also the adoption of a common definition of terrorism.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that these measures strike an appropriate balance between taking strong action against terrorism and at the same ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. The attacks in the United States on 11 September were unprecedented. They have forced civilised society to think again about the measures, legislative and others, in place to deal with the scourge of terrorism. Rarely has the choice between good and evil been put in such stark relief as by the attacks carried out that day in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania by the force of international terrorism with their consequent tragic loss of life. It is in this context that Ireland is determined, with our partners in the European Union, to frame a decisive and effective response to those who would perpetrate such attacks and that would be the aim in framing the legislative proposals needed to give effect to this proposed framework decision and related issues.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Shatter's question about the law, in general it will require member states to ensure that their laws make certain specified offences punishable as terrorist offences when they are committed against one or more countries, institutions or people with the aim of seriously altering or destroying the political, economic or social structures of any country. The offences in question range from murder and other violent offences to offences endangering people, property and the environment. Member states will always be obliged to criminalise directing a terrorist group, participating in or supporting such a group and laundering the proceeds of offences committed by such a group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter and others spoke about the definition of groups as terrorists or as structured. The definition is an unwieldy one which was agreed by the 15 member states and was previously agreed in the context of combating organised crime. On Italy, it has no difficulty with this text. On Dáil committees, an issue that was also raised by Deputy Howlin, in general, justice matters are dealt with by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights while the Joint Committee on European Affairs has looked at justice affairs from a European viewpoint. It is perhaps something which the committees should consider. I note from the debate on the Forum on Europe in the wake of the Nice treaty that there is a very strong emphasis on more parliamentary scrutiny, a view which I share.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the question of harmonising offences and maximum sentences across the EU. This, as the Deputy acknowledges, is a very difficult issue. There have been a number of discussions with the JHA Council on this matter. However, it has proved almost impossible to date <Col N="916" /> to get agreement on maximum sentences. There has been greater progress in harmonising the definition of offences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked for an update on events since the 20 September meeting of the JHA Council. On mutual assistance, convention and protocol, legislation implementing those instruments will be presented to the Oireachtas next year. On the police chiefs' task force, this was established following the October meeting of the European Council in Tampere in 1999. It has an obvious role in co-ordinating activities. The anti-terrorist task force is established at Europol in The Hague and is responsible for collating information.</P>
    <P>Deputies Gormley and Higgins queried the word &ldquo;extensive&rdquo;. As the footnote indicates, this word is taken from the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. This is a UN convention signed in 1999. Legislation to ratify it will be before the House early next year as required by UN Resolution 1373. The definition is a matter for legislation.</P>

      <P>The definition will be decided in domestic legislation. The Deputy asked if this would prevent people from protesting. Like other Members of the House, I would have been involved in many protests over the years. Section 10 of the preamble states:</P>
      <P>This Framework Decision respects fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they emerge from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States as principles of Community law. The Union observes the principles recognised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, notably Chapter VI thereof. Nothing in this Framework Decision may be interpreted as being intended to reduce or restrict fundamental rights or freedoms such as the right to strike, freedom of assembly, of association or of expression, including the right of everyone to form and to join trade unions with others for the protection of his or her interests and the related right to demonstrate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. The essence of the motion, which asserts a general cross-party support for the concept of enlargement, is something I welcome. It disposes of one dimension to the discussion we have had on the Nice treaty but given the shortness of time, I would like to offer some other views on the position in which we now find ourselves. I find the kind of discussion initiated by those who represent an intolerant view as to what happened in the referendum singularly unhelpful, and I want to be specific. Articles like that which appeared two days ago from Peter Sutherland are extraordinarily unhelpful. Not only do they suggest that we should, somehow or another, feel we have to rush to assuage European interpretations of the result of the Nice treaty but they seek to <Col N="918" /> apportion blame for the failure of success in the referendum itself.</P>
      <P>Views from outside during and immediately following the referendum were singularly negative, confusing and unhelpful. Again, I will speak plainly given the shortness of time. The statements immediately after the referendum by Romano Prodi were unhelpful and are recognised as such. The more recent behaviour and statements of Javier Solana are unhelpful this week as they were on numerous occasions previously.</P>
      <P>We need a period of consideration as to what we do now. I am grateful to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for putting down the motion and giving us an opportunity to reflect on how we might appropriately use our time. I suggest that it is best to begin at the end &ndash; in 2004 &ndash; and work back from the presidency. One can then submit the tentative Intergovernmental Conference process that might precede 2004 to an analysis but also to a comparison with an Intergovernmental Conference process in the instance of the Nice treaty which was singularly unhelpful. It is also possible, working back through that process, to look at institutional deficits in terms of openness and transparency, mechanisms of reporting from Council of Ministers to the Parliament here and mechanisms of relationship between the different institutions of Europe.</P>
      <P>That some have taken a strident position beginning with the suggestion that the people were wrong, that they probably do not know why they were wrong and that a few people, who have singularly failed to get elected to Chambers such as this, are going to tell them why they are wrong is disastrous and unhelpful. It also undermines the work taking place in the forum. The forum may have a different meaning for the different participants but in it, we hear from countries which have applied to join the European Union and which are waiting. We also hear opinions from those who took different positions on our recent referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make some suggestions as to what the debate might contain. Again, I am afraid that those who subscribe to the end of history thesis and who believe the European world which exists was brought into existence in 1989 are inflicting a rather strange prejudice on the discussion as well. Europe pre-1989 was different from Europe post-1989. Post 1989, Europe went to the right. It established a market economy as the central paradigm of the relationship between politics, people and economics. It is unique and, therefore, we have an item to discuss. Is the enlarged Europe to be a social Europe? Is it to be a form of economy with significant social guarantees? If, for example, one was to look at world trade as well as foreign direct investment, one would find that there are some unique features in Europe and in the potential of an enlarged Europe. It trades mostly with itself, unlike the United States. If one takes a triadic analysis of world trade or of foreign direct investment, by which I mean the European Union, <Col N="919" /> Japan and the United States &ndash; Canada is looked on slightly differently &ndash; one will find it very interesting that only 25% of world trade is available outside that quadric structure of trade and foreign direct investment. Europe has the capacity, because it trades so much with itself, to be any kind of enlarged society and economy it might wish. It has different structures in relation to the relationship of society and economy in the United States and in the potential of the enlarged Europe. That is something to invite the people of Europe.</P>
    <P>I was in favour of the Nice treaty precisely because I wanted the applicant countries to have the social guarantees of a social Europe and a social economy rather than the barbarism of the crude market economic model of the United States &ndash; I do not put a tooth in it in relation to that. There are those within the debate now who are trying to suggest that the future of Europe can simply be a market model. It cannot be, except with disastrous results. Already many of the applicant countries &ndash; we have heard from them &ndash; have been speaking about the price that has to be paid in terms of pensions, worker security, unemployment, state activity, the narrowness of investment and so forth. It is important for us to realise that, if we are talking about an enlarged Europe, we should talk about a decent vision that will draw as much on the history of Europe and its potential as it does on a narrow market model.</P>
    <P>What I find interesting about Sutherland's thesis and others is the singular inability to draw on the best capacity of Europe both philosophically and politically. Wherever has there been a hint at origins of democracy, of the impulse of the philosophical tradition, of diversity of culture? He is as wrong about the future of Europe as he was in Uruguay regarding the World Trade Organisation and as he is about Doha. I deliberately mention this because one is unlikely to hear it from other people.</P>
    <P>It is important that we approach this debate without reductionist simplicities or the creation of fear, and without the arrogant assumption that there are those who know better than anybody else and who are only too willing to give us a lecture. It is important to listen to people in Dublin Castle and at the forum. We have no right to take advantage of the insecurity of, for example, very new multi-party democracies. There were times when advantage could have been taken of us because of our economic fragility. New democracies have the right to draw on their cultures to put a shape on Europe that will be generous. If it is to be generous, Europe has to be open to different forms of market economy.</P>
    <P>We should sort out our situation but we are not in a position to give lectures to Europe on what it should do. With regard to the external context in which a debate such as this is taking place, there has to be a respect for equal participants within treaties. We simply cannot go with those who are inventing a bellicose rhetoric of war, <Col N="920" /> such as Javier Solana, and participate in cabals that are barely legal within the treaties. If people are asking for a debate about enlargement &ndash; the concentration should be on 2004, an open Intergovernmental Conference process and a generous shape for Europe &ndash; it requires that we all have discipline in the creation of that vision. That is not the rule of the strong and it is not the rule of the militaristic strong in particular.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I support this motion because the effectiveness of the European Union and its enlargement are vital national interests to Ireland. The liberal democratic world order, established after the Second World War, has provided a basis for unprecedented opportunity, prosperity and peace across all countries and continents. On our continent, the EU has been the essential political and economic foundation for this order since the 1950s and for the benefits it offers. Given the history and achievements of the EU and the history of the continent of Europe in the 20th century, it is no wonder that up to 13 countries are seeking membership of the EU.</P>
      <P>The strategic benefits offered by membership of the EU clearly win out over alternatives. Fundamentally, it is an option in favour of a liberal, democratic, free and prosperous society. Ireland, like each member state, benefits strategically and practically from its role in the EU. We benefit strategically in that we are part of a stable order of democracy, trade and peaceful international relations in which peace and prosperity flourish. We benefit practically by job creation based on trade and investment, by a common currency, common agriculture policy and inter-regional transfers.</P>
      <P>Ireland's participation in the euro has brought about the fundamental benefits of low interest rates and a stable currency based in an economic zone 16 times its size. The value to Ireland of membership of the euro zone is immense, bringing itself to bear on every household and business in the country. No case can be made to suggest that we would have been better off having stayed out of an independent currency, tiny in world terms, while most members of the EU join together in the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone would we have been seen as a satellite of sterling but we would have been forced to have much higher interest rates in times of international uncertainty. No case can be made either that does not stop the economic zealots of Sinn Féin opposing the introduction of the euro in Northern Ireland and proposing the withdrawal of the Republic from the euro. I am certain the people of Ireland would be horrified to have their jobs and their livelihoods staked on Sinn Féin's <Col N="921" /> central banking, interest rates and economic isolation of the North Korean variety. Let us hope the media spotlight is turned on this part of Sinn Féin politics also.</P>
    <P>As we introduce euro notes and coins, we would do well to remind the public of the great benefits of the single currency, which the people of Ireland voted for democratically. Membership of the EU allows Ireland to seek to be the best place to do business for international companies in a market of 350 million. This is at the heart of job creation in Ireland for many years.</P>
    <P>Approximately 140,000 people have jobs in IDA-supported companies here. It is fair to say that most, if not all, of these jobs would not exist if we were not members of the EU. Nobody comes to Ireland because of the size of the domestic market, with its population of merely 3.7 million people Although it is impossible to make an exact calculation, the number of jobs that arise indirectly from these international investments in Ireland as a base within the EU is certainly within the hundreds of thousands. Our membership of the EU, therefore, directly effects the employment and well-being of hundreds and thousands of workers and families throughout the country and their ability to live and work in their own homeland.</P>
    <P>Where trade is concerned, the successive expansion of the single European market has brought new opportunities to our companies. Our exports to the EU accounted for more than 60% of our total exports last year, reaching 50.2 billion. Add the applicant countries and the potential for growth is very appealing. All accession states are now fully engaged in and fully committed to agreed economic reform programmes. These reforms will build the economic structures and income levels that will enhance the attractiveness of the accession countries as markets for businesses in Ireland. The Government has worked to ensure businesses in Ireland are in a position to take full advantage of the opportunities offered. The level of political exchange and trade missions has increased significantly in recent years. In many areas, these trading relationships are the result of strong foreign investments in Ireland.</P>
    <P>EU enlargement will make Ireland a more attractive location for global companies as long as Ireland remains a competitive place for business. Just as heretofore in the EU, there is no simple guarantee that the strategic and practical benefits will be achieved for Ireland and for our fellow member states. We will have to put political and diplomatic effort into achieving them. The practical opportunities for trade and employment are there to be worked for. They will not be handed to us on a plate by the institutions of the EU or by fellow member states. That handout mentality never served Ireland well. It is a mentality which often lies behind the doubts of those who question whether one can be sure enlargement will be good for us. The answer is that enlargement will benefit Ireland for sure if we <Col N="922" /> work to seize the opportunities that open up for us and if we keep our economy competitive and adaptable.</P>
    <P>Our efforts must not simply be to secure discrete measurable benefits for Ireland, but to work to achieve wider benefits for all the member states. The old analogy is valid &ndash;  we must work at the same time to expand the cake and ensure we get our fair share of it. Our efforts must be applied in two critical areas. First, we must work to make sure the union functions efficiently and democratically. This means getting the right institutional design, effective decision-making procedures and democratically acceptable balances between collective and national decision making. Our political and diplomatic engagement with our fellow member states on these issues will be all the more effective the more it is based on a well-developed, democratic debate nationally. That is why the National Forum of Europe is playing a valuable role.</P>
    <P>Second, we must work to ensure that, where the union follows collective policies, they are the right ones to secure the benefits we seek and that they are implemented effectively. The Union must have the right policies as well as the right structures if Ireland and our fellow member states and accession countries are to benefit from our collective project.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the EU's Lisbon agenda is fundamental. The Union must make substantial progress towards achieving the goal of becoming &ldquo;the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion in the near future&rdquo;. An inward-looking Europe will not achieve the desired level of competitiveness, employment and social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Enlargement will be good for Ireland and good for Europe provided we work to make it so. Enlargement is not about aggrandisement. It is about consolidating and extending the shared strategic and practical benefits the European Union accords all its member states and peoples. The Progressive Democrats believe ratification of the Nice Treaty is necessary for the enlargement that all current member states and accession countries want and we will work to achieve that. The people of Ireland will not and do not want to prevent enlargement. We must address the process to ratify the Nice treaty in that context and in the context of the real benefits to the people of Ireland of active, engaged EU membership and of enlargement. It makes no sense politically or economically to attempt to separate the shared benefits of EU membership and enlargement from narrow benefits to Ireland alone. If we as a country actively play our part in facilitating enlargement in an EU with the right decision-making structures and policies, we are building strategic and practical benefits for Ireland and Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>To retreat from that collective effort or to pretend we can make it work in a way which suits us <Col N="923" /> alone would be damaging to Ireland's interests as a European State and to our livelihoods and the interests of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Enlargement is the most important and challenging development for the EU in the next few years. It is striking that accession negotiations will probably finish in the same year that the euro becomes a reality for our citizens. This confirms that the EU is dynamic and full of life and continues to develop in a positive way.</P>
      <P>By agreeing to admit these new members, the EU is righting a past wrong &ndash; the artificial division of Europe, which lasted for far too long after the Second World War. It marks a return to normality. The accession of these countries will allow them finally to turn their backs on the dark years of the Cold War and will underpin their achievements in transforming their societies and economies, basing them on democratic principles and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Taking in new members will lead to a stronger Europe. The unambiguous experience of all past enlargements is that new members bring with them fresh political and economic dynamism and enthusiasm. In our case, we began to experience independence truly only when we joined the EU. The new members will also be a major asset in addressing the major challenges we face in coming years &ndash; expanding the market, consolidating the euro and developing foreign and security policy.</P>
      <P>The Government fully supports enlargement and it also has the full backing of the people. According to regular Eurobarometer surveys of Europe-wide opinion, Irish people are among the most pro-enlargement of all EU people. We have explained to both our EU partners and the candidate countries that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Nice referendum did not in any way reflect a negative attitude to EU enlargement. I was pleased when we met Mr. Moscovici that that message has certainly been received by the French Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To more closely examine our relationship with an enlarging Europe, it was decided to establish a national forum on Europe. In the past few weeks the forum has been able to debate several aspects of enlargement and has confirmed widespread support for the process. It has also heard many interesting insights from distinguished Irish and foreign speakers on how enlargement will affect important Irish interests such as agriculture, trade and investment as well as the environment and social policy. The mission in each of these areas is overwhelmingly positive. Ireland stands to gain much from a greatly expanded marketplace, with more than 100 million new customers. Assured and free access to that marketplace will bring substantial opportunities for Ireland. At present only between 3% and 4% of what Ireland produces is exported to the candidate countries. The potential for two way trade is very significant. Irish trade with candidate coun<Col N="924" /> tries has already grown sixfold since 1993 and last year Irish exports were more than £1 billion in goods and services to these countries, while imports were nearly £500 million. This is a very healthy trade surplus and is just the beginning of what is possible when one takes into account that these countries import 40% more than they export.</P>
    <P>These emerging economies also need the type of expertise and input that knowledge-based Irish business can offer, especially at a time of economic downturn in many of our traditional markets. Many Irish companies are at a stage of development where they need to invest abroad if they are to expand and continue to provide high quality jobs at home. Already there is substantial investment by Irish companies such as AIB, CRH and Waterford Wedgwood in the candidate countries. In Poland alone Irish business has made investments of more than £1 billion. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development made it clear last week at a session of the forum in Cork that enlargement itself will not pose a threat to the CAP or existing funding arrangements. He expressed confidence that Irish agriculture and the food industries will be well prepared to cope with any increased competition on the domestic market and to exploit opportunities in exploit markets as well as maximising their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas in the next ten years. It is important to note the main farming organisations, which were all fully represented at that forum session, all indicated their support for enlargement.</P>
    <P>Some people are afraid that Ireland will lose out because foreign firms will relocate to central and eastern Europe. That issue was also addressed at a session of the forum and all participants at the session concluded that enlargement would not by itself impact negatively on our investment potential. It is true that Ireland will be competing with firms from countries with lower labour costs than ours. However, business rarely relocates on those grounds alone and Ireland is in any event already competing with low-cost countries and winning investment due to, among other things, our higher education and skills base. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have already adapted their strategies to ensure that Ireland retains its highly competitive position and continues improving its skills levels and infrastructure. As long as the Irish economy remains competitive and productive we will continue to have success in attracting foreign industry and developing indigenous companies.</P>
    <P>It is possible for the candidate countries to be transformed in a dramatically positive way by membership of the EU, as happened to Ireland. We are keen to provide them with whatever assistance we can. Many of them look on us as role models, particularly in how we use funds and in the working of social partnership. Ireland has much in common with these countries. Many of them are similar in size to us and our experience <Col N="925" /> in Europe has made us particularly sensitive to their special needs. We are very aware of this in the detailed negotiation process.</P>
    <P>Our own adjustment to membership was not always smooth but that difficult adjustment was a necessary part of the transition which enabled us to take full advantage of our new opportunities. The enlargement process has gained new momentum in recent months and is now truly irreversible. Each enlargement in the past has been of benefit to those joining the EU and to those who were already members. This pattern will continue. The newly acceding countries will join a Union which will help to guarantee and reinforce the political and economic transformation these countries have undergone. The EU itself will of course benefit from this but also from what the new States will bring to the Union, not just in terms of increased trade opportunities. The task for us is to ensure we and the EU have made the necessary preparations and that we are ready to accommodate the new States. To fail to do so would be a failure of huge magnitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Keeffe on putting down this motion. I welcome the detailed and positive speech of the Minster for Foreign Affairs and the Tánaiste's comments. Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred quite rightly to the disappointment expressed by most Members in relation to the outcome of the Nice referendum last summer. I refer in particular to the very low turnout of 34%. The highest turnout for a referendum in Ireland was in 1937, when the draft Constitution was put before the people but in 1971, the turnout for the referendum to allow us to accede to the European Economic Community was 70%. Something I find disappointing in relation to people's participation in electoral politics was the low turnout for the Good Friday Agreement referendum in May 1998. That was the first opportunity for all of us in the Thirty-two Counties to vote on the same issue on the same day. In the Republic of Ireland only 56.26% of the electorate turned out for that referendum, even though it was giving us the opportunity to put behind us more than 30 years of terrible difficulties and the needless deaths and injuries of thousands of people. That was a very low turnout. As an Ulster person, I regret that many people did not vote in the Good Friday Agreement referendum, on which there was political consensus and in favour of which the overwhelming majority of the electorate voted. Many excuses can be put forward, for example that people are busier nowadays and do not have time to go to a polling station. I do not accept the argument that it was easier to get to a polling station in 1937 than in 1998.</P>

They wanted to be part of the electoral process and to show their appreciation of the efforts of generations of Irish politicians who struggled to place sovereignty squarely in the hands of the Irish people. The turnout for the Nice Treaty referendum was most disappointing and the only glimmer of hope I took from it was that 53% of voters in my county voted in favour of the treaty.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister that self-interest never entered the minds of the people of my county.</P>
      <P>The European Union traces its origins to the signing by six countries of the Treaty of Paris in 1951, which established the European Coal and Steel Community. It took until 1973 for the first enlargement of the community, when Ireland, the United Kingdom and Denmark joined. Further expansions in 1981, 1986 and 1995, brought the Union to its present total of 15 member states. It can be argued that none of the previous enlargements matched the importance of that now in prospect, as 12 countries are in accession negotiations. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out yesterday, current indications are that ten new states may have concluded negotiations by the end of 2002 and entry in 2004 is a real possibility for them.</P>
      <P>The importance of this enlargement, however, is not in its scale. Fundamentally, it represents an historic moment for Europe, uniting the continent peacefully for the first time, on the basis of democracy and respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law. Why are these countries so eager to join the European Union? Why have they made the sacrifices required in terms of economic restructuring and why are they prepared to abide by the disciplines of the Single Market and the single currency? The applicant states see in the European Union a political and economic opportunity to improve the quality of life of their citizens, without sacrificing their independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent speech, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, concluded that he sees sovereignty &ldquo;not merely as the ability of a single country to say no, but as the power to maximise our national strength and capacity in business, trade and foreign policy, defence and the fight against crime&rdquo;. <Col N="927" /> In other words, he recognises, as successive Irish Governments have, that it is self-defeating to cling to an outdated notion of absolute sovereignty. The more isolated a country becomes, the less genuine influence it can assert over its destiny. Outside the EU, would Ireland have any control over matters such as duties on exports, investment opportunities for businesses, exchange rates or other international affairs? If a country like the United Kingdom now sees the EU as vindicating and protecting its sovereignty, how much more important is the EU for smaller states? Surely this is why applicant states, generally of smaller size, see the Union as their best hope of protecting and guaranteeing real independence.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to suggest that the European Union is perfect, as that is far from the case. It is easy to spot the flaws of the EU, but most institutions, local, national or international, have such failings. Politics is about achieving change and reform where required and preserving what works well and this is as true in Europe as it is in Ireland. In recognition of the fact that the Union has grown remote from its citizens, the Laeken Summit this weekend will launch a new phase of discussion and debate, focusing on ways to bring the Union closer to the people. Transparency, accountability and democratic legitimacy need to be increased.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the forthcoming enlargement of the EU and of the origins of the Union. It was widely recognised before the Amsterdam Treaty that reforms and changes were required to prepare a Union, originally designed for six members, to accommodate up to 27 member states. Many people have argued that qualified majority voting, a key element in helping to complete the Single Market, should be extended further to prevent repeated blockages at Council. It is strongly felt that the Commission cannot continue to grow along current lines, as a body with 35 members would be unwieldy. People have argued that the weighting of votes in Council should be altered to avoid unduly reducing the relative influence of the citizens of larger states after enlargement.</P>
    <P>Some of these changes were agreed at Amsterdam, but it was generally recognised that further specific modifications were required before further enlargement. The negotiation of the Nice Treaty returned to these issues, which are generally described as those left over from Amsterdam. A balanced agreement, acceptable to all, was eventually agreed. The Nice Treaty is of far more limited scope than the Amsterdam or Maastricht Treaties, although the changes made are crucial to facilitating enlargement.</P>
    <P>The opponents of Nice rarely, if ever, discuss the content of the treaty. A survey recently conducted by the European Commission office in Dublin indicated that the actual provisions of the treaty were low on the list of reasons why people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Anti-Nice campaigners focus on red <Col N="928" /> herrings, either making the false argument that Nice is not required for enlargement or saying that Nice compromises neutrality, even though it makes no change whatsoever on that front. Those who speak about the democratic deficit fail to acknowledge that if such a deficit exists, it is primarily located in this country and is our responsibility to overcome. Opponents speak of a loss of power or influence without indicating how a small country like Ireland could exert influence outside the European Union.</P>
    <P>Some people insist that the Nice Treaty died as a result of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in June, but I consider such a view to be extreme. Our partner member states are continuing with ratification procedures, as is their right. All states, including applicant states, have reiterated their support for enlargement, proceeding on the basis of the changes agreed at Nice. The Irish people have the right to decide where this country stands in relation to Europe and we cannot be forced to do anything we do not wish to do. Anti-Nice campaigners are wrong to believe we have the right to force the rest of Europe, including the applicant states, to abandon the Nice Treaty.</P>

      <P>Ultimately, a failure by Ireland to ratify the Nice Treaty, while a problem for the European Union, would be a more serious problem for this country.</P>
      <P>The unreality of those who oppose the treaty is illustrated by Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment to this motion. It suggests that the Government should unilaterally insist on a new treaty, one which would result in a Union where population size plays no part. In Sinn Féin's fantasy Europe, the citizens of Malta would elect as many MEPs as the citizens of Germany, which is a strange version of democracy. The European Union has always been a Union of states and of peoples. All states have equal weight in key areas where unanimity is required but it is proper in other areas that, while the citizens of larger states should have a say, there should be a weighting towards the smaller states in the interests of cohesion.</P>
      <P>The truth is that Sinn Féin, the Green Party and other groupings cannot offer a realistic alternative to the Nice Treaty. While they call for a new treaty, or even the wholesale destruction of the Union as we know it, they never indicate how the other member states and the applicant countries should be convinced to adopt their views. Ireland can make its own decisions, but it cannot force its views on the rest of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Crawford, Deenihan, Coveney, Owen and Ring. I compliment Deputy Brendan Smith on his very good speech, which came straight from the heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make about seven points, the first of which relates to my view of Irish history. While we gained our independence in a technical sense <Col N="929" /> in 1921, we did not become truly independent until we joined the European Union. This country was so dependent on Britain to provide a market for its goods and to manage its currency that it was nominally independent but effectively an appendage of Britain. Joining the European Union completed the work commenced by Daniel O'Connell which was continued by Charles Stewart Parnell, John Redmond, Michael Collins, Eamon de Valera and all who fought for Irish self-governance. We obtained that self-governance when we joined the EU because it gave us the capacity not to be dependent on one interlocutor for the influence we wished to have over what happened in this country. It gave us the possibility of playing the field and of making allies, apart from Britain, on issues which were important to us.</P>
    <P>I do not make a habit of speaking from a Nationalist point of view as I am conscious of its limitations as a political ideology. However, from a Nationalist point of view, I cannot understand the position of those such as Sinn Féin who oppose Ireland's full-hearted membership of the EU. This attitude is anti-national because it was only through the EU that we gained full and true independence.</P>
    <P>As someone who had the privilege of attending such meetings, when it comes to a <i>tour de table</i> at a Council of Ministers or European Council meeting, Ireland is equal to all other countries. We are equal to the French and the Germans. Our voice is heard and is equal to any other country in terms of the decisions which are taken. The size of the country does not matter.</P>
    <P>The Government should not take an unduly negative or defensive approach when negotiating issues in the future. It should not take the view that we cannot agree to this or that because it might frighten the horses in the second referendum. If we take that approach we will create problems for ourselves. The sooner the Government states that it is going to hold a second referendum the better, but I understand its reticence to do so for the moment. If we are to win the second referendum, it is essential that we sell our involvement in Europe on a positive basis and on the kind of things to which Deputy Brendan Smith referred. We must sell it on the basis of our capacity to influence what happens in the world through our membership of the EU. We live in a world of global disease, crime, climate change and economic contagion. On its own, Ireland has no possibility of influencing any of these issues. However, as a member of the EU it has the possibility of influencing them and it will be listened to.</P>
    <P>I advise the Government not to look for some kind of opt-out regarding defence or some suggestion that we will not participate in the Rapid Reaction Force. The Government has already secured complete freedom for the Oireachtas as far its commitment to the Rapid Reaction Force is concerned. However, we should not go any further down this road. We <Col N="930" /> should state that we are prepared to bear our share of the sacrifices. People are not stupid. They know that if it comes to it, it is not fair to say that one can stop genocide by making speeches or by dropping food parcels. The only people who can stop genocide are those who are armed and who have the ability to shoot those who are murdering others because of their race or religion. Genocide can only be stopped by military intervention and Europe must have the capacity to stop it.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the permanent damage which has been done to Ireland's interests by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Treaty of Nice, even if the result of the second referendum is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Those negotiating with Irish Ministers in future regarding the treaty will not be sure that our Ministers can deliver. Someone who cannot deliver in a negotiation does not get the best deal. We have to recognise that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; result in the referendum on the Treaty of Nice has done permanent damage to our situation. We have to try to retrieve the situation, but we must be honest enough with ourselves to admit that we will not do so completely.</P>
    <P>Do we wish to end up like Norway which has to accept all the state aid and competition rules laid down by the European Commission? Norway is in the EEA because of the need to trade, but it has no say in these decisions. Do we wish to become a colony of, rather than a participant in, Europe as far as economic policy is concerned? If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Treaty of Nice a second time we will become a colony of, and not a participant in, Europe. That is not something to which a self-respecting people should aspire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important subject. I wish to re-emphasise the point made by Deputy John Bruton that it was only through membership of the EU that Ireland became a real nation. Only then were we able to hold our heads high and become leaders of the Union on the basis of the rota system.</P>
      <P>As a Member of the Oireachtas I had the privilege of visiting Hungary and Poland. The latter in particular reminded me of what Ireland was like before we entered the EU. Ireland's failure to ratify the Treaty of Nice sent shock waves through the applicant countries, a message clearly received by those of us who made friends in them. Their attitude was that Ireland was not well-off when it joined the Union, that we did well from it and are now not prepared to let others join.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People voted against the Treaty of Nice for diverse reasons and because of the Government's failure to sell the real value of an enlarged Europe. I spent seven years representing the livestock sector at EU level, five of them as chairman of the EU beef and veal committee. I witnessed at first hand those who fought in two world wars sitting around a table trying to create regimes which would help us to work together. This highlighted how the EU could work and I served in <Col N="931" /> this capacity at the time of the last enlargement process. The EU has come a long way since the days of the European Coal and Steel Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland has done well from membership of the EU. Industry, agriculture and the public have done well out of Europe. We had setbacks in 1974 and during the 1980s, but much of that was due to our own failures. EU funding for education, agriculture, infrastructure, etc, has been very helpful and beneficial. However, and this goes for all politicians, we have often failed to admit that many of the good things that were done were financed by European funding provided by our European counterparts.</P>
    <P>In the past few days I heard members of the Fianna Fáil Party state that the Government had provided £14.5 million for the water and sewerage scheme in Monaghan. However, they failed to admit that about £8 million of this came directly from the EU Cohesion Fund. The sewage treatment plant in Monaghan town was built with the help of INTERREG which is funded by Europe. Such behaviour does not help to encourage people to support the EU. Before we go back to the people it is important that we learn about the information deficit regarding the meaning of the EU.</P>
    <P>I have represented farmers, and still deal with many farming problems as a Member of this House, but we failed to secure the farming vote in the referendum. Farmers would possibly benefit most from the Treaty of Nice. They are fed up with the bureaucracy handed down to them. If they make a minor mistake they lose their payments for 12 months. I recently received a letter from the Department which did not make sense. The official involved admitted this fact, but he did not lose out. He was allowed to rectify the mistake without any loss.</P>
    <P>We are all committed to Europe, but we must not blame it for everything. Farmers did not receive grant payments from November 2000 until November 2001 because the EU did not agree to us funding grant aid. Through my colleague, Joe McCartin MEP, we learned that the application was not made until July 2001, yet farmers were told that the failure was on the part of the EU. We must examine these issues. We must not blame the EU, but give it credit where it is due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I spoke to a friend in Poland and told him we were in the process of discussing a Fine Gael motion calling on the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that Ireland does not impede or delay the accession of the applicant states to the European Union. My friends in Poland and Hungary are happy that this debate is taking place because their impression of the Irish people and parliament is one of suspicion. I met my Polish and Hungarian contacts when I was a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and they came to Ireland looking for information and <Col N="932" /> advice on how to approach accession to Europe. They came to me to discuss areas such as agri-tourism and organic farming. They were enthusiastic about getting involved in Europe and the opportunity this would present to them. They were doing their best to improve their agriculture and to bring their production processes up to European levels.</P>
      <P>The rejection of the Nice referendum left them shocked and disillusioned. I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials have come across similar reactions in applicant countries. People in eastern Europe could not believe that Ireland, which was always held up as the shining light of what membership of the European Union could do for a poor country in a short period of time, could reject enlargement. They were hoping to model themselves on Ireland's success and become the Irelands of the next decades. We dashed their expectations by voting for what I feel were very selfish reasons.</P>
      <P>What we have achieved in agriculture, roads infrastructure, sanitary provision, education, telecommunication, forestry and many other areas could not have been achieved without help from the EU. The Government and politicians often use this funding for political gain and often do not tell people that it has come from Europe. Recently in Kerry, at the opening of something that had nothing to do with infrastructure, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform listed the money that had been and was being spent on roads. Much of this money came from Europe but that was not mentioned. Politicians of all parties have deliberately omitted to tell people that money spent by successive Governments actually came from Europe. It is not too late to make it clear to people that great sums of money come from the European Union.</P>
      <P>There was resistance by the environmental lobby to membership of the European Union but were it not for EU directives, far more damage would have been done to our environment. But for the establishment of special areas of conservation and national heritage areas, many of our prime amenity areas would have been desecrated.</P>
      <P>The Minister is committed to Europe but some of his colleagues have been guilty of duplicity in the past number of years. In saying one thing in Ireland, another in Europe and yet another in America they have confused people. However, the people are not fools. They hear through the media what is being said in this House and elsewhere and any contradiction confirms their suspicions that some Ministers are not fully committed to Europe.</P>
      <P>I am delighted Deputy Jim O'Keeffe tabled this motion and gave Fine Gael, which has always been a pro-European party, an opportunity to reiterate our support for enlargement. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be able to lead his party along those lines also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for giving Fine Gael the oppor<Col N="933" /> tunity to reaffirm our support for the concept of EU enlargement. In debates on the future of Ireland and Europe, the theme of enlargement has dominated discussion since the rejection of the Nice Treaty in the referendum on 7 June last. This House has a responsibility to show leadership to the many Irish people who may have concerns about the Nice Treaty, European enlargement and what it entails.</P>
      <P>The general concerns relating to issues such as integration, militarisation, a common defence policy, neutrality and so on have caused people to stop and think and these concerns need to be dealt with in a wider debate on Ireland's future in Europe. However, this evening I will concentrate on the merits and threats of EU enlargement itself.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that everyone in Ireland is in favour of enlargement and merely voted against the Nice Treaty because of concerns about issues such as militarisation. We must convince the Irish people that enlargement is a goal of common good throughout Europe, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is important that we consider the merits of new members joining the EU, not only from an Irish perspective but also from the perspective of the applicant countries. It is not so long since we looked from outside into the EEC and saw the merits of common policies and co-operation in an economic and political bloc of nations working together for a common purpose.</P>
      <P>For applicant countries, enlargement means consolidating their recently won or restored democratic systems. For democracy to prosper in these countries it is essential that they be given an opportunity to prosper economically and socially. Joining Europe can provide that opportunity. Enlargement can mean participating in a single market and in other policies of the EU, leading to the increased levels of prosperity which they see in member states. It can mean becoming part of a law based community of States, ensuring peace, stability, law and order with human rights as a priority. Applicant countries can learn from best practice in economic development and in parliamentary, administrative and legal reform. They can see stability, economic opportunity, democratic law, order and future prosperity. These are concepts we cannot argue against in principle and which must be promoted.</P>
      <P>From an Irish perspective, some may feel threatened by the addition of up to ten new applicant countries with a population of nearly 100 million people. Many Irish people are concerned about decreasing structural funds and agricultural assistance due to greater demands and poverty elsewhere. Concerns about large numbers of migrant workers moving from east to west also must be allayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enlargement offers Ireland far more opportunities than potential threats. Economically, enlargement offers a massive increase in markets. Ireland is unusual in Europe in being a net exporter. We export nine out of ten of our cattle and a similar ratio of sheep and pigs. A potential <Col N="934" /> extra 100 million customers is something we should not turn down lightly.</P>
    <P>The only way to ensure that migration from eastern Europe stops is to offer the countries of eastern Europe the opportunity to prosper also. If we keep these countries outside the EU and in poverty the problem of asylum seekers, refugees and economic migrants will continue. For Europe as a whole, the EEC, which became the EC and finally the EU, has brought peace and prosperity to Europe for the first time in centuries. The threat to peace and prosperity in Europe now lies between east and west and the way to allay that is to join them in a common purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for putting down this motion and I also thank the Government for agreeing to accept this motion without a vote. It would be a very bad message to send out from this House if we were to split on this motion and that is why I welcome it. I am in no way dismissing the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the Nice referendum campaign. It is a pity we did not hear more of him or that he could not have been more involved because in the debates I did hear, I feel he convinced many people, who thought they would stay at home, to come out and vote yes.</P>
      <P>During the campaign those advocating a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote managed to encapsulate their campaign in pithy language and poster slogans even though some of their reasons for voting against the treaty had no basis in reality. Whichever Government is responsible for leading the campaign for the next referendum, be it the current Government or, it is to be hoped, one from this side of the House, I hope those in favour of the treaty will get across the reasons for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in an equally pithy way using advertising and billboards. In this way people who did not bother to vote may be persuaded to come out and vote the next time.</P>
      <P>I have had the opportunity, as have many Members of the House, to monitor elections in newly emerging democracies and I only wish we could take every citizen of this country to see people who are getting their vote for the first time, to see how much they want to take part, how long they will wait and how long they will walk and travel to take part in a democratic vote. Yet we are losing the will to participate in elections and we will rue the day that people increasingly abandon going to polling stations, particularly when an issue as serious as our membership of the EU is at stake. It is timely to remember the aspirations of Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman when, in 1950, they developed the Treaty of Rome. Their conviction was that Europe should not be made all at once or according to a single plan but built through concrete achievements. There is no doubt among the 15 members that there have been concrete achievements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We knew the objective of the EEC when we joined in 1973. It was to raise standards of living <Col N="935" /> and to safeguard peace. There is no doubt that we have raised the standard of living in this country as a result of our membership. I reiterate the question asked by Deputy John Bruton: where else would a small island with 3.5 to 3.8 million people have the same standing around a table as countries with ten times that population and ten times our economic advantages? That is the kind of message people should be getting from us.</P>
    <P>Membership has brought huge benefits to this country, including laws that protect the salary and wage rights of women, workers' rights and disability rights; environmental protection laws; market share and the opening up of new markets; cultural relationships; advantages in terms of much of our art and many of our artefacts; police co-operation; and co-operation in fighting against drugs and terrorism. Those are the benefits we must sell to the people and we must not allow people to be taken down the road of believing things that are not in the treaty and cannot harm the country. I hope when the time comes for the next referendum all Members of this House, including people who are now second-guessing the referendum, will be here together saying that we are right to be in Europe and we will not thwart the rights of the aspirant countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue. When the Bill concerning the Nice Treaty referendum came before the House I had an opportunity to speak and I am glad we are having this debate again tonight. The previous speakers should not take the people for fools. The people listened and learned and then expressed a view at the ballot box. That view was that they did not know what they were voting for. They were dissatisfied by the way the message had been sent out. All political parties, especially those in Government, must take responsibility for this. The Minister for Foreign Affairs fought hard but he was a lone fighter because other Members hid in the ditches and went behind counters and told people to vote no, even though they were on the Government side of the House. Some of them had held very senior positions in the party. That may have been their position but they should have come out openly about at the beginning so the Minister and Government could have dealt with those issues earlier in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did people reject the treaty? They did not reject the idea of enlargement. Rather, they rejected what is happening here at the moment. People feel this House does not stand for anything and that all legislation now comes from Europe. When a Minister has bad news to deliver, be it at public farming meetings or housing meetings, the first thing they say is that they had no control over what happened, that it was the result of EU legislation. According to politicians, everything that comes from Europe is negative. As previous speakers have said, we do not hear anybody telling the people of the west, or anywhere <Col N="936" /> around the country, about the kind of infrastructure that was put in place using EU money. Most people do not have the courage.</P>
    <P>I have nothing against the EU Commissioner, Mr. Byrne &ndash; he is a nice man &ndash; but he is elected by nobody. He does not represent me, because I never saw his name on a ballot paper. He certainly does not represent the views for which I stand. I did not see much action from him during the referendum campaign, if he had the courage to do anything. I did not see him in Galway or Mayo or on the television fighting for this. He was abroad doing his job with his big salary. He knows that if the Government happens to be in place the next time around he has a chance of being re-appointed. That man's name should have been put on a ballot paper so that the people could vote for their commissioner. If that had happened, he would have been working hard to make sure his job was safe and that he would be there the next time.</P>
    <P>The people have spoken. They are saying to the Government and to everybody in the House that the next time there is a referendum they want to know, clearly, what they are voting for. They want to know what the issues are and what power will be maintained in this Parliament. We were elected to this Dáil but at times I wonder whether we would be better off back at home, because we have less power here than some of the guys from the county council. Our powers are being taken away. I disagree with Deputy Deenihan about SACs and NHAs. The son or daughter of a farmer who wants to build a house in any rural area are told they cannot build because the area is protected as a scenic area for visitors from Europe over the next 20 years. The problem in rural areas is that people come from Europe to shoot and fish and they come to the west maybe once or twice a year, but they object to planning permission if it is granted by a council. I do not see how the Government expects people to vote for enlargement and support Europe when they hear negative things about legislation from Europe on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I am a European and I believe in Europe, but I believe it must be the responsibility of this Parliament to work with Europe and to be careful what message we send the next time. I wish I had more time to speak on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to respond to this very worthwhile debate. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated last night, the Government is happy to support the Fine Gael motion which in our view sends the right signals to our European Union partners and, equally importantly, to the applicant states. I am glad that the strong consensus in this House in favour of enlargement has been reconfirmed and that there is a shared determination not to impede or delay the accession of the candidate countries to the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Several Deputies, including the leader of the Labour Party, have eloquently made the case for enlargement. While there is an appreciation that it is an historic opportunity and a moral imperative, too often there is a failure to recognise that it has the potential to be strongly in Ireland's economic and commercial interests also. The forum's sessions on agriculture and on trade and investment have helped dispel anxieties about low-cost competition and have underlined the market opportunities which will exist. Moreover, the whole of the European economy, including Ireland, will benefit. President Prodi put it well in the European Parliament on Monday when he said:</P>
    <P>From an economic standpoint, enlargement is one of the few games in which all the players stand to win. It will bring stronger growth not only for the new member states but also for the fifteen.</P>
    <P>Another point made by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Durkan, was that the applicant states were particularly disappointed and surprised by the outcome of the referendum on Nice precisely because they see themselves as having so much in common with us and because they recognise that it is only through the ratification of the Nice Treaty that enlargement can proceed. This is a reality however much those who opposed and oppose Nice may wish to pretend otherwise. The Minister for Foreign Affairs spelled out comprehensively yet again yesterday evening the background to the Nice Treaty and exactly why it is necessary for enlargement.</P>
    <P>A failure to ratify the treaty on schedule would seriously impede and delay the enlargement process. The rest of Europe would draw little comfort from the assurances of Deputy Ó Caoláin and Deputy Gormley that they are firm supporters of enlargement while urging the people to block the means by which it might be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is clear that most of the political opposition to Nice has less to do with the treaty itself than with the basic character of the European Union as it has developed over 50 years, to our enormous benefit as a nation. Deputy Gormley spoke last night of his preference for an intergovernmental approach &ndash; I wonder if he wishes this to be the case in environmental matters.</P>
    <P>The European Union has been so effective precisely because it involves much more than this. Its unique institutional character and its foundation of binding European law have been particularly important for smaller states like Ireland. A return to intergovernmentalism would in fact do far more to boost the relative power of the larger states than anything in the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin's approach to Europe was well illustrated by their performance in the Northern Ireland Assembly last week where they lined up with the DUP in opposition to introduction of the euro as a parallel currency in Northern Ireland. They seem oblivious to the immense economic importance for Ireland, as a small open economy, <Col N="938" /> of EMU and of the Single Market, a point made on Monday by Peter Sutherland. Ireland remains fully committed to the European security and defence policy. This does not involve, as some would suggest, the creation of a European army but rather it is a policy to equip the Union to undertake humanitarian, conflict prevention and crisis management tasks.</P>
    <P>This presents a real opportunity for Ireland to play a constructive role in promoting peace and stability. Our commitment in this area is fully consistent with Ireland's approach to overseas peacekeeping and with our foreign policy traditions. Ireland's future development, like its development over the past 30 years, will be bound up with our remaining at the heart of the European Union as active, committed participants, respected and valued by our partners, and with the capacity to shape the Union's processes to our advantage.</P>
    <P>The Government fully appreciates the importance in this context of resolving the current difficulties. While it continues to consider exactly how to proceed, it has not been inert or inactive, as claimed by Deputy O'Keeffe, and it recognises that there are serious issues that need to be carefully addressed.</P>
    <P>The National Forum on Europe is providing a very valuable platform for debate and for clarifying some of the issues which may lie behind the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote. Fine Gael would undoubtedly enrich its work and strengthen the pro-European side of the debate by taking its seats in the forum.</P>
    <P>The Government is also preparing major proposals on the reform of Oireachtas scrutiny of EU issues. What is most important, however, is that all of us who support a successful Ireland in a successful Europe vigorously continue to make the case for enlargement and for the European Union and to reveal to the Irish people the sheer inconsistency and illogicality of those who claim to support enlargement while in effect opposing the European Union.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. I have only five minutes to speak on a subject to which one could not do justice in five hours.</P>
      <P>As a committed European, I believe it is in our interest to allow all the applicant countries to join an enlarged European Union. I spoke at length when the referendum Bill on Europe was before the House. We must never lose sight of the original Treaty of Rome. That appears to have gone astray in much of the debate I have heard over the past six or eight months. Due to its objectives and principles and because of advanced cohesion it managed to bring 15 countries together and makes the possibility of war between the states much less likely. In all the debate this matter was forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of human rights is important in the context of an enlarged Europe. Human rights and natural justice are the cornerstones of all democracies. That is significant for many of the so-called democracies that are likely to join the EU <Col N="939" /> in the future. One need go no further than the tragic events which unfolded in County Wexford at the weekend to realise the benefits of everyone aspiring to the level at which human rights and related matters are controlled within the EU. Such an occurrence would not have been possible if the country concerned had been a member of the EU &ndash; or at least I do not think it would.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that many of the industries that set up here since we joined came here for 3.5 million people. The market simply was not big enough &ndash; they had a wider vision altogether but by getting a foothold in here they would drive on to an enlarged Europe.</P>
    <P>There is no point casting aspersions as to who did or did not do anything in regard to the referendum. This population was never more prosperous than on that day. Our economy was expanding and jobs were falling out of the sky. People react to the prevailing situation and not what might happen in future. Now that we have got a shock to the system, people will have to reflect on the reasons the economy was proceeding as strongly as it was. Without an involvement with Europe we would not have been able to kick-start the economy in the way we did.</P>
    <P>There are problems with how things are handled by the European Union. Individuals everywhere have serious trouble with it. There is a significant reason so many farmers voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;. There are many cases of farmers not being entitled to their grants because of making a minor mistake in regard to the regulations. That type of incident becomes common knowledge and engenders fear of such a system. One would want to kill someone or deal in drugs to be fined to the same extent as the farming community. Unless something is done about this before the next referendum people will not wear it.</P>

      <P>I am happy with the big turnout of speakers for this debate &ndash; 19 speakers in three hours is an indication of the level of interest of Members of this House. Many others would have spoken if there had been a time slot available. This points to the need for Government time to be given to debates in this House on Europe. Apart from changing the Government, it is the most serious issue facing this country over the coming 12 months. Holding this debate is very important and, equally important, is that my party has secured the unanimous agreement of the House in favour of the enlargement of the Union. That is necessary because the message received throughout Europe following the rejection of the Nice Treaty was that Ireland is against enlargement. To correct Deputy Brendan Smith, Deputy Gormley made it clear when speaking in support of the motion that he favours enlargement. That should not be forgotten. There has been no speech on the motion against enlargement. We should be pleased with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the second part of the motion was not adequately addressed by Govern<Col N="940" /> ment speakers. While it seeks support for enlargement of the EU, it calls on the Government to take all appropriate steps as soon as possible to ensure that Ireland does not impede or delay the accession of applicant states to the EU. While the Government has accepted that part of the motion, there has not been any indication of action. It is worrying that the Government has not taken steps to ensure that we will not impede enlargement and it has given no indication of its intent to do so. Six months have elapsed since the referendum and while the Minister and the Taoiseach have indicated that there has been reflection, analysis and examination there has been effective paralysis. That is disgraceful in the context of the need for action to be taken and be seen to be taken before the people are again asked to vote.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason for this inactivity but I am convinced measures must be put in place before we return to the people. That will take time and if the Government is not prepared to put them in place or to even outline what it would like to do it is proceeding towards a false dawn and risking the possibility of a further rejection in the next referendum. If that happens let it be on the Government's head. As a European and as someone convinced of the need for public approval of the Treaty of Nice in the interests of Europe, I believe that for the applicant countries and, above all, my country, this is a dangerous course of action. I do not know the reason for it.</P>

      <P>The Government has not responded to our invitation to advise the House of the appropriate steps it proposes to take. On Question Time yesterday, the Taoiseach vacillated and appeared confused. This was highlighted by a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, which had the following headline: &ldquo;Ahern refuses to say &lsquo;yes' or &lsquo;no' on Nice poll.&rdquo; An adjacent headline covering the debate in the Dáil debate last night reads: &ldquo;Cowen warns of consequences of failing to ratify the Nice Treaty.&rdquo; This epitomises the confusion on the part of the Government and especially the vacillation by the Taoiseach. That is why I am worried. There is a need for a detailed package of measures to be put forward for consideration by the House, the Seanad the Oireachtas committees and, ultimately, the people. There is a failure of leadership on the part of the Government if it does not act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> In opposition, the Fine Gael Party has attempted to deal with this lacuna. We produced a serious 40 page document, Ireland in Europe &ndash; the Way Ahead, which has been laid before the Oireachtas Library. We set out a six point plan on what we consider should be done. While we do not believe it is a complete answer, the plan contains serious proposals for consideration.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government, in the interests of the country, not to waste any more time. There is a need for consultation within the parties and in the Oireachtas. The Government should publish its proposals and make time available for debate. It is extraordinary that there would have been no debate in this House were it not for the fact that Fine Gael moved a Private Members' motion on this issue. Nineteen speakers were crammed in to a three hour session because no more time was available. The Government must make time available in the Oireachtas for debate when it publishes its proposals.</P>

That cannot be done without a programme of measures. I am glad the Government <Col N="942" /> had the good grace to accept the motion by way of support for the enlargement of the European Union but I am concerned that it continues to fail to publish any proposals to deal with the consequences of the rejection of the Nice Treaty in the referendum last June.

      <P>This matter was vigorously debated on Committee Stage by my colleague, Deputy Stanton, and, therefore, I will not delay the House. I know the Minister is anxious to attend this evening's party and also to introduce the Bill in the Seanad. I am reluctant to stand in the way of either ambition.</P>
      <P>The consequences of 11 September are so enormous, all-embracing and far-reaching that, this evening alone, the House has debated motions on extradition and combating terrorism and is now dealing with this Bill which is designed to provide indemnity in relation to insurance claims for airlines and aviation services. The matter in question here is when the order will come into effect. On Committee Stage, Deputy Stanton argued vigorously in favour of substituting the word &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; for &ldquo;making&rdquo;. I accept that the Transport Council and ECOFIN have authorised the scheme until March and I know the word &ldquo;making&rdquo; provides retrospection for a period of six months. I will not press the amendment, I merely wish to hear the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Jim Higgins for his implied co-operation this evening. Tonight's party is not really important, what is vital is that the Bill should proceed to the Seanad. This is an important Bill because it enables the State to continue to underpin the operations of the airlines, airports and those who provide services at airports and ensure they are indemnified.</P>
      <P>Before replying to the amendment tabled by Deputies Jim Higgins and Stanton, I am sure the House will be glad to know that a framework agreement has been signed this evening by the unions, the Government and those involved in the partnership programme. This agreement will now be put to the employees of Aer Lingus and they will vote on whether to accept it. I thank all of those who worked on the framework agreement &ndash; union leaders, politicians and officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>Despite the emergence of the agreement there is no doubt that there are many challenges and difficulties ahead. I have no doubts whatever about the sincerity and depth of work and feeling which went into reaching the agreement. I understand fully the difficulties encountered in attempting draw it up. I hope the agreement will carry within it the seeds of hope for Aer Lingus, the 4,000 employees and our country and will lead to future growth on the part of the company.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask four or five questions to clarify the position. First, is there any indication with regard to how long the interim measure in relation to providing indemnity for airlines and aviation services will remain in place? In other words, has any indication been received from the insurance industry about whether its position has changed? Second, have all companies withdrawn indemnification for airlines and aviation services? Third, I know until now the insurance industry has insisted on insurance being provided on an itemised basis &ndash; for example, every aeroplane had to be individually covered. Will collective cover be provided under the interim measure for all aeroplanes, equipment, etc.? Fourth, the Government will recoup from the airlines the costs for providing indemnification. How much money is the Government accruing in that regard and how much are the insurance companies forfeiting? Fifth, which airlines, aviation service providers and airports are being indemnified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know how long the interim measure will remain in place. The EU keeps extending it by three months and it will remain in place until at least the end of March 2002. It may be extended again in February or March. In my opinion the reasons for this lie in the uncertain position <i>vis-à-vis </i>the war and the fact that there appears to be no end in sight. One company has come forward and offered to provide insurance indemnity, at highly expensive rates. Cover is being provided on a collective basis. The Government is currently taking in approximately £1 million per month from the airlines and this is being lodged with the Exchequer. Under the Government aviation insurance scheme, cover is being given to nine airports, the Irish Aviation Authority, eight ground handling companies, one aircraft cleaning service provider, two fuel suppliers, two aircraft maintenance service providers and nine airlines.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with the amendment. I understand that Deputy Stanton is unable to be here owing to a death in the family. With regard to the amendment, if an order were to apply for six months from the date of commencement, it would have to be renewed before 24 March, only three months after it was made. The Bill, as drafted, provides that the first order will be made on 22 December and will run until 21 June. We do not know when this will end. It is hoped that it will end sooner than we are allowing for.</P>

One can imagine the number of appeals to which this would give rise. On Committee Stage, Deputies were interested in the amount that would be charged for the indemnities. That will be based on the guidelines laid down by the <i>ad hoc</i> EU committee and it is being worked out for us by Coyle Hamilton, the brokers.</P>
      <P>On the amendment, I do not underestimate the sense of fair play inherent within it. However, it would involve the Department in some sort of benchmarking in relation to airline companies and in judgments as to which would or would not have the ability to pay.

I can understand that concern. It is proposed to amend section 12(4) by deleting the words &ldquo;delay or default&rdquo; and substituting the words &ldquo;reasonable delay&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regard the battle against tobacco as one of the most important public health challenges facing us in the new millennium. I have made this area one of my main priorities as Minister for Health and Children. The Government at its meeting on 27 February 2001 approved the drafting of the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, and agreed to give the Bill priority in the Government's legislative programme. The text of the Bill was approved for publication by Government on 31 July 2001 and published on 1 August 2001.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the most comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation ever published in this country and confirms the Government's commitment to the battle against the tobacco epidemic. The Bill will bring together a number of legal instruments and will replace two existing Acts, the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act, 1978 and the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, and incorporate certain provisions of the Government's policy, &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strong legislative measures are an important public health instrument in countering the tobacco threat. Tobacco use and, in particular, cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of pre<Col N="948" /> ventable illness in the country. A survey commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control on attitudes to smoking and smoking prohibitions has shown there is considerable support among the public for measures to control tobacco consumption, to make smoking less attractive to young people and to help current smokers stop smoking. This support is broadly based, coming from non-smokers and smokers alike. The public welcomes restrictions on tobacco retailing and promotion of tobacco products. Most smokers recognise the dangers of smoking, the increasing social unacceptability of smoking and wish to break their smoking addiction. The survey shows that the public generally and smokers specifically are looking to Government to take further action on smoking on all fronts.</P>
    <P>We also need to provide greater protection for people against inhalation of toxic environmental tobacco smoke. Studies in the USA have shown that restricting smoking in public settings increases the likelihood that smokers in these settings smoke less or quit smoking entirely. The introduction of smoke free areas supports those who wish to quit and protects non-smokers.</P>
    <P>In the early years of the last century when tobacco use, largely through smoking cigarettes, was becoming widespread the product was seen as benign and recreational. Today, tobacco smoking represents the most extensively documented cause of disease ever investigated in the history of biomedical research. In the early 1950s major scientific studies first began to associate ill health and disease with the use of tobacco products. In 1964, the US Surgeon General released a report entitled &ldquo;Smoking and Health&rdquo; which concluded that cigarette smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men and to a lesser extent in women. The dangers of smoking and its detrimental effect on human health have been clearly established in numerous scientific studies carried out by reputable medical and scientific bodies, including the World Health Organisation, particularly over the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>Evidence has accumulated, year on year, of the enormous worldwide threat to human health from consumption of tobacco products. Furthermore, studies carried out internationally in recent years have also confirmed that there is a significant risk to the health of the non-smoker from inhaling environmental tobacco smoke, referred to as passive smoking. The adverse impact of tobacco consumption on public health is enormous. Smoking related illnesses account for about 7,000 deaths each year in Ireland and 500,000 deaths each year in the European Union. Tobacco can kill in many ways, including lung cancer and other forms of cancer, heart disease, strokes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. Smoking tobacco products is one of the most unhealthy things a human can do.</P>
    <P>Life expectancy is lower in Ireland than the EU average and the diseases which contribute primarily to this are heart disease and cancer. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of these <Col N="949" /> diseases. Smoking is a major causative factor in about 90% of the 2,000 deaths from lung cancer each year and increases the risk of other cancers such as the mouth and throat. Smoking is also a primary cause of cardiovascular disease, the greatest single cause of mortality in Ireland. Tobacco is a significant burden to individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. Reduction in tobacco use will increase life expectancy in Ireland and result in happier, healthier and better quality lives for many Irish people.</P>
    <P>About 30% of the adult population are severely addicted to nicotine in tobacco products and the vast majority of smokers become addicted in their childhood and teenage years. Smokers who begin smoking in adolescence and continue to smoke regularly have a 50% chance of dying from a tobacco related illness. Smokers have three times the death rate in middle age of nonsmokers. These are appalling statistics.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the increasing levels of smoking among children and access by under-age persons to cigarettes. Children are easier to addict to tobacco products than adults and damage to children's health can be genetic and lifelong. Advertising of tobacco products and sponsorship of events by tobacco companies play a significant role in inducing young persons to smoke and to continue smoking. Children smoke the most heavily advertised brands of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The smoking of tobacco products also poses a real and significant threat to the health of the non-smoker. Almost 70% of the adult population are non-smokers yet many people are unwillingly exposed, on a daily basis, to toxic environmental tobacco smoke. Environmental tobacco smoke is causally associated with acute and chronic diseases in non-smokers. Being able to breathe clean air, free from harmful irritating tobacco smoke, is a serious issue for everyone. Many public areas and facilities and some workplaces are subject to prohibitions and restrictions on smoking and there is a growing demand for increased protection from tobacco smoke. Optimal protection for non-smokers and smokers is best provided by smoke free areas. I will use enabling powers under section 46 of the Bill to extend environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and facilities not already covered by existing legislation and regulation, including the workplace and pubs.</P>
    <P>Children are particularly at risk from passive smoking. As children grow, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke significantly reduces their lung capacity and exercise tolerance. Involuntary exposure of children to tobacco smoke has been identified as a cause of respiratory disease, middle ear disease, asthma attacks and is a significant factor in sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS. Children are powerless to control their exposure to tobacco smoke and yet, because of their age, are most adversely affected by exposure to this toxic combination. We must ensure that the children and young people of today, whether <Col N="950" /> through being induced to smoke tobacco products or exposure to and inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke, do not become future victims of the tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>The global tobacco industry, through its own extensive scientific research, knew for many decades the dangerous and addictive nature of the product it manufactures, promotes and sells. Yet the industry for decades denied that nicotine is addictive, that smoking and secondhand smoke cause disease and that tobacco advertising recruits children and keeps adults smoking. The tobacco industry used a wall of words to protect itself at the expense of public health. The public were not informed by the industry of the real facts about the dangers to health from tobacco consumption. It is only in recent years that public health authorities have come to fully understand the dreadful nature of nicotine addiction and the powerful marketing skills of the tobacco industry to induce people, and particularly young persons, to smoke. Once young people become hooked, the tobacco industry works hard to maintain that addiction.</P>
    <P>Much information has come to light in the last decade about the unscrupulous behaviour of tobacco companies with regard to targeting young people with their products. Documentation disclosed from within the tobacco industry during litigation proceedings in the United States shows an industry doing everything it can to encourage smoking and to establish and maintain tobacco brand loyalties, particularly with young smokers. The industry continued to market its products worldwide without regard to their harmful effect on human health. This same industry, while claiming publicly to wanting to work constructively with Governments in introducing tighter regulation of tobacco, has consistently striven to frustrate and undermine all such efforts. They not only seek to thwart national efforts to effectively address the tobacco problem but also those pursued at regional and global levels.</P>
    <P>The cynical attitude of the tobacco industry to human life was revealed in an economic report on health care costs and smoking commissioned by Philip Morris in the Czech Republic and published in June this year. The report concluded that, as smokers die prematurely, this is beneficial by saving the State substantial amounts of money that would otherwise have been spent on health care and pensions. This spurious economic argument shows a complete disregard for basic human values. That premature death, human suffering and ill health caused by smoking tobacco products should be discounted against long-term economic gains is reprehensible.</P>
    <P>The Irish tobacco industry, with thousands of its Irish customers dying each year from consumption of its products, is reliant on recruiting new consumers to remain a viable industry. Young people are sensitive to perceived signals that smoking is the norm. These signals include visible public smoking, the availability of cigarettes to minors and widespread promotion and <Col N="951" /> advertising of tobacco products. Logically, the industry needs access to young people to gain new smokers, and we must deny it that access. The aims of the tobacco industry are totally contrary to public health policy.</P>
    <P>Tobacco advertising and sponsorship are a powerful means of increasing tobacco consumption and attracting young smokers. Ireland was one of the first countries to introduce restrictions on tobacco advertising and sponsorship by the tobacco industry. Both the World Health Organisation and the World Bank recommend that countries prohibit all forms of tobacco advertising and sponsorship. I have already taken a number of very positive steps in this area with Ireland last year being one of the few EU countries to prohibit the advertising of cigarettes in newspapers, magazines and other publications.</P>
    <P>Tobacco companies were spending up to £10 million annually in Ireland on advertising and sponsorship. The tobacco industry consistently used sponsorship of events to promote a harmful and socially destructive product. In July 2000, I terminated this expenditure despite fierce opposition from the tobacco industry and I make no apologies for this. Banning advertising leads to a reduction in tobacco consumption and in preventing new smokers from starting. Bans on advertising have an impact on youth attitudes to smoking and directly further the Government's commitment to prevent young persons from taking up smoking. I approved the replacement of tobacco sponsorship of the Irish Masters snooker tournament with health sponsorship. This assured the continuance of this popular international event and replaced tobacco promotion with a healthy anti-smoking message. International research has shown that anti-smoking sponsorship of sports events is effective in sending a particular message to the public. I will continue to ensure that a clear, sustained and positive health message is sent to the population, particularly our young people.</P>
    <P>I have already taken a number of anti-tobacco initiatives in the area of health promotion using broad-based public awareness campaigns with a special focus on young people. The following are some specific examples. The &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; campaign was launched in association with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards. This campaign emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual. The campaign involves national and local initiatives, which offer support for those people wishing to give up smoking. An advice kit was developed as a support for those who want to quit.</P>
    <P>NICO was developed last year to target the growing number of young teenage girls who are smoking or who are starting to smoke. This anti-smoking campaign emphasises the negative effects smoking can have on physical appearance, for example, stained teeth and wrinkled skin. The storyline is that there is nothing sexy about smok<Col N="952" /> ing and the media used are television, radio, outdoor and newspaper advertising. Television is a proven useful resource in accessing young people. Strategically located outdoor sites, such as those adjacent to schools and colleges, complement the TV and radio ads.</P>
    <P>The best prospect of reducing the number of people, especially young people, smoking or not starting is a targeted approach. In this regard, initiatives such as the social, personal and health education programme are particularly important. Since September 2000, a social, personal and health education programme is offered at junior cycle level to post primary schools nationwide through a partnership between my Department, regional health boards and the Department of Education and Science. Social, personal and health education is a broad based health education programme which aims to enhance the self-esteem and decision making skills of young people using experiential learning methodologies. Implementation of this programme will ensure there is a co-ordinated approach between health boards and the Department of Education and Science at regional level in a way that has never formally existed before. I am committed to ensuring that this process is a success and that a secure place will be established for health education within the school system to complement the work that has already taken place in many health boards.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of the out of school setting for delivering health messages to young people. My Department has again teamed up with the Department of Education and Science and also with the National Youth Council of Ireland to provide a wide range of health promotion training for the youth sector through the national youth health programme. This programme promotes the notion of a health promotion youth service thereby ensuring that the messages young people receive in school are mirrored elsewhere, and the Office of Tobacco Control has also been involved with a group of young people acting as advocates and peer leaders in terms of the anti-tobacco issue.</P>
    <P>Most smokers wish to break their addiction to nicotine based tobacco products. Additional help has been made available to smokers to help them quit. Since 1 April 2001, I have made the full range of nicotine replacement therapies including patches, gum, sprays and tablets available free of charge to medical card holders on prescription by their GP. Since I have introduced that measure, about 16,000 people have taken it up.</P>
    <P>The tobacco epidemic can only be beaten with the commitment of society as a whole. A concerted and sustained effort is necessary to make progress. This Bill provides for strong legislative measures to tackle the tobacco epidemic on a number of fronts. A comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays, and on all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry is proposed. Tobacco advertising is intended to increase consumption as well <Col N="953" /> as brand share and has a powerful effect on young people. Advertising and related activities are major influences on children taking up smoking. The industry has known of this for many years and has exploited rather than compensated for this childhood vulnerability.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill proposes further restrictions on tobacco advertising. Many of these provisions are in place under a statutory instrument with effect from 14 July 2000. However, the existing controls do not prohibit in-store or retail advertising, which will be prohibited under this Bill. This re-balancing of the rights of the public, especially children, and the rights of the tobacco industry is necessary because the <i>status quo</i> ensures that children will continue to take up smoking in increasing numbers and become addicted before reaching adulthood. The evidence is that the total prohibition on advertising is very effective but that partial prohibitions do not give a <i>pro rata</i> return.</P>
    <P>Since July 2000, advertising of tobacco products and sponsorship by tobacco companies is prohibited, other than limited in-store and trade advertising. This was done under existing legislation and regulations restricting the amount of money that tobacco companies are allowed spend on promoting their products. While in the past Ireland has severely restricted sponsorship which provided advertising for tobacco products, the tobacco industry has identified a number of ways around this restriction, for example, sponsorship to promote the company name rather than a tobacco product. The full extent of this practice is not known but the Bill will prohibit such practices.</P>
    <P>The approach to enforcement in the past has been piecemeal. Compliance with existing laws especially in relation to sales to minors has been poor. Surveys have shown that many underage young people can purchase tobacco products over the counter from retailers without being asked for evidence of age. The evidence from other campaigns, such as drink driving campaigns, is that strong enforcement combined with positive public messages are necessary to effect real change in public behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide for comprehensive powers of enforcement and will introduce a range of penalties which are commensurate with the offences. The age limit for sale of tobacco products to young persons was raised from 16 to 18 years earlier this year and the maximum fine for persons convicted of selling tobacco products to underage persons has been raised substantially on foot of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001. These measures are incorporated in the Bill and will act as a further deterrent to retailers. My Department has already begun the process of increasing the number of health board environmental health officers who will enforce the tougher tobacco controls. I made available this year an additional £1 million for this specific purpose. The Bill requires retail outlets which sell tobacco products to be registered. Such regis<Col N="954" /> tration is recommended in the Government's policy document &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society,&rdquo; and is justified on public health grounds as it will facilitate inspection and compliance, as provided for in the proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>A ban on retail sales of packs of cigarettes of less than 20 is also proposed. Price is the single most effective means of protecting children against experimenting with cigarettes and becoming addicted. Increasing the minimum pack size which may be sold raises the price barrier for children. This measure was also recommended in the Government's policy document &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society.&rdquo;  The results of a survey commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and published in October this year concluded that the sale of cigarettes in larger packs will significantly reduce consumption. Ten-packs of cigarettes are bought mainly by young smokers. Accordingly, it is proposed to ban the sale of packs of cigarettes containing less than 20 cigarettes.</P>
    <P>There will be tighter controls on the sale of tobacco products from vending machines. Many cigarette vending machines are located in areas of licensed premises, often out of sight of staff, where there is no form of supervision, giving unrestricted access by underage persons to cigarettes. The Bill provides for much tighter control on all aspects of tobacco retailing including vending machines. Machines will have to be located beside, on or behind the bar counter and under the direct supervision of staff. Regulations will provide that the machines, which will have a locking device, will be activated for each sale by a unique coin or token available only from staff on the premises. The need for much tighter controls on these machines has been made clear to the cigarette machine operators.</P>
    <P>A ban is proposed on the sale of confectioneries, normally intended for children, which resemble a tobacco product. Selling confectioneries to children in the form of tobacco products is a particularly odious practice and helps to build an unhealthy relationship and familiarity between children and tobacco products. Children who use candy cigarettes are more likely to become smokers. Some of the candy cigarette packets on sale in shops are difficult to distinguish from packets of cigarettes. Our legislation and regulations at present relate only to controls on the sale of tobacco products. The new Bill prohibits the sale of these types of confectionery products.</P>
    <P>Public disclosure of all aspects of tobacco including toxicity and addiction will also be provided for. The Bill provides the proposed Tobacco Control Agency with powers to obtain information from manufacturers relating to the composition or properties of tobacco products and to test tobacco products. The agency may, subject to certain requirements, publish this information. Tobacco contains many chemicals which are cancer causing, and gases such as carbon monoxide which cause heart disease. The pharmaceutically active ingredient in tobacco smoke is nicotine. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance <Col N="955" /> and breaking that addiction is difficult for most smokers. There is international evidence that the industry manipulates this addictive characteristic through the use of certain chemical technologies such as ammonia, and by using genetically modified tobacco plants with high nicotine content. Accordingly, certain technical standards relating to the composition of tobacco products need to be set. Compliance with these standards needs to be independently monitored. In addition, health warnings and batch numbering will be mandatory on all packs. The industry will have to meet a very high threshold of disclosure about the toxicity and addiction of its products and the public will be truthfully and fully informed about the composition and toxicity of tobacco products. False or misleading claims will be prohibited. An EU directive on these measures was adopted earlier this year.</P>
    <P>There will be improved protection for people against passive smoking. Tobacco smoke is the biggest single source of indoor air pollution. Environmental tobacco smoke is a real and substantial health hazard especially to infants, children and persons with heart or lung disease. Tobacco smoke contains as many as 4,000 chemicals. Many of these are harmful to health and at least 60 are known to cause cancer in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, a specialist agency of the World Health Organisation, classified tobacco smoke as a human carcinogen in 1986. A human carcinogen is a cancer causing substance for which a cause-effect relationship has been established.</P>
    <P>The risk to health related to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, ETS, is well known. The WHO air quality guidelines for Europe concludes that ETS has been found to produce a substantial amount of morbidity and mortality from other serious health effects. Environmental tobacco smoke is the single most important source of harmful indoor air pollution. That has been supported by two decades of evidence and the scientific community now agrees there is no safe level of exposure to second hand smoke. Three of the main components of tobacco smoke are nicotine, an addictive drug, tar, which is a cancer-causing substance, and carbon monoxide, which interferes with the oxygen supply to the heart and blood vessels. Carbon monoxide is the same lethal gas which is released by motor vehicle exhausts. Other toxic components include hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde and benzene.</P>
    <P>There is an international scientific consensus that environmental tobacco smoke kills. Passive smoking is a cause of disease in otherwise healthy non-smokers. Tobacco smoke contributes to a noxious environment, causes eye irritation, sore throat, cough, and headache.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable expectation on the part of the public that they should not be exposed to such a toxic combination, whether in their work place or in public areas and facilities. A European Commission research study found that more than 80% <Col N="956" /> of Europeans over 15 years of age are exposed to ETS and inhale the equivalent of one or more actively smoked cigarettes per day.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation has been shown to be robust in facilitating the extension of controls in this area and these relevant provisions are being incorporated into the proposed Bill. The Bill accordingly will provide significant protection for people against environmental tobacco smoke. However, I will use enabling powers under section 46 to extend environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and facilities not already covered by existing legislation and regulation. That includes the work place, pubs and other areas.</P>
    <P>The tobacco control agency will be established on a statutory basis. It will monitor, co-ordinate and, in certain circumstances, enforce the new tobacco policy initiative. The agency will drive the implementation of many of the Bill's provisions and will co-operate with all relevant agencies in working towards a tobacco free society. It has already been established on an administrative basis and is located on a temporary basis in Clane, County Kildare. The work of the agency will be complemented by a Tobacco Free Council to be serviced by the agency and which will have a much broader representation than the board of the agency and will be drawn from a wide range of disciplines necessary to promote a tobacco free society. The council will be a consultative forum.</P>
    <P>Public health authorities in many countries have grappled with the problem of how to prevent people from taking up smoking and how to get smokers to break their addiction once established. There is no single solution to dealing with the tobacco epidemic. In the early 1970s, the incidence of smoking here was about 43%. Successive administrations, by a combination of measures including legislation, regulation and health promotion were able to reduce this to today's level of just over 30%. Our success in improving the health status of the nation is linked to reducing further the level of tobacco usage and, in particular, preventing young persons from starting to smoke. If the incidence of tobacco use by young persons can be reduced we can make considerable progress towards a tobacco free society.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that legislation alone, no matter how comprehensive, can create and sustain the environment necessary to prevent people from starting to smoke and to assist those who have already started a programme to stop. Our anti-tobacco strategy will be multi-faceted, containing, as it will, strong legislative controls, effective enforcement powers and resources. However, the strategy will also have a well resourced health promotion dimension, a fiscal element and the supports required by smokers to kick the habit. The implementation of this comprehensive strategy will, in time, effect the necessary attitudinal changes in society to tobacco consumption and then the necessary behavioural changes. We owe it to ourselves, to the younger <Col N="957" /> generation, and to future generations to ensure that the war against tobacco is won. It gives me great pleasure to commend the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, to the House. I look forward to the debate and will be open to taking amendments on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would need a calculator to work out the number of times the Minister used the first person singular &ndash;&ldquo;I did this&rdquo;, &ldquo;I did that&rdquo; and &ldquo;I did the other&rdquo;. I will tell him a few things he did not do and which he should have done. I would have thought the Minister would have found the civility to acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children which produced two major reports on this issue. Perhaps the fact one was written by Deputy Shatter and the other by me does not allow the Minister to acknowledge them. Despite not having one extra person working for us, we were able to produce those reports. I am very disappointed that somebody in the Department of Health and Children could not find a line in the Minister's script to acknowledge that, so I presume it was some of the Minister's political people who drafted that speech. It is very ungenerous in its contents. While I welcome the provisions generally, this Bill does not go far enough, and I will come to that during my contribution.</P>
      <P>Tobacco kills between 6,500 and 7,000 people in Ireland each year. The Minister put the figure at 7,000. Some 31% of the population smokes and between 35% to 40% of children smoke before they reach the age of 18. There is a slight variation between the figures the Minister gave and mine, and I have drawn on the Oireachtas committee report for those figures. Smoking causes more than 90% of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis and emphysema and the incidents of smoking is most common among young men aged between 25 and 34 years in the lower socio-economic groups. That is a significant point. The heaviest smoking rate is found among married people between the ages of 35 and 49 years living in Dublin in the lower socio-economic group. One can identify where the full extent of the problem is most acute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the research we did for the report on smoking, which I compiled as rapporteur for the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, the number of lung cancer deaths in Ireland as a percentage of all deaths has risen from 9.7% in 1970 to 21.2% in 2000. Some 33% of boys aged between 15 and 17 years and 80% of all smokers become addicted between the ages of 14 and 16 years thus highlighting the need to combat under age smoking. I welcome the provisions in so far as they go in that regard. These smokers, as the Minister said, will have a 50% chance of dying from a tobacco related illness. Tobacco is one of the greatest causes of preventable deaths. Authoritative estimates suggest that by 2030, smoking will cause ten million deaths world-wide per annum. This means smoking will cause approximately one in every six deaths by 2030. There are <Col N="958" /> now about 1.1 billion smokers world-wide. Estimates are that by 2025, this figure will rise to 1.6 billion.</P>
    <P>A very interesting statistic is that half of patients admitted to St. James's Hospital in Dublin are admitted with smoking-related illnesses. The cost of running St. James's Hospital this year will be something of the order of £170 million. One could probably attribute half of that, or near enough to half &ndash; £85 million &ndash; to smoking-related illnesses. That is in one hospital alone. It is an extraordinary charge on the Exchequer. I will come back to this in relation to the tobacco industry later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse, passive smoking &ndash; breathing in other people's exhaled tobacco fumes &ndash; may contribute to as many as 870 deaths per year in Ireland. Based on comparable US statistics, of the 7,000 or so Irish people who died last year from smoking-related cancer, about 870 people have died from second hand smoke. That is a great deal more than 10%. Illnesses include respiratory problems cancer, blood pressure difficulties, hardening of the arteries and even amputations.</P>
    <P>Damage done to the health of the nation by smoking must be given greater attention. Publicans must be more realistic in their demands to be exempted from tobacco legislation health measures. In this context, the Minister for Health and Children must explain why he specifically omitted naming public houses as places where smoking will be banned while he does mention other public buildings where the ban already exists.</P>
    <P>In section 46 the Minister lists the places where the regulations prohibiting or restricting the smoking of tobacco apply:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations, prohibit or restrict the smoking of tobacco products in&ndash;</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;a)an aircraft, train, public service vehicle, or a vehicle used for the carriage of members of the public for reward other than a public service vehicle,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)all or part of&ndash;</P>
    <P>(i)a health premises, or</P>
    <P>(ii)a hospital that is not a health premises,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) all or part of a school or college,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>)all or part of a building to which the public has access, either as of right or with the permission of the owner or occupier of the building, and which belongs to, or is in the occupation of&ndash;</P>
    <P>(i)the State,</P>
    <P>(ii)a Minister of the Government,</P>
    <P>(iii)the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, or</P>
    <P>(iv)a body established by or under an Act of the Oireachtas,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> (<i>e</i>)a cinema, theatre, concert hall or other place normally used for indoor  public entertainment,</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>)all or part of any other premises or place, of such a class as may be specified in the Regulations (hereafter in this Act referred to as a &ldquo;specified place&rdquo;).</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister say &ldquo;I did this, I did that and I did the other&rdquo;. He did not mention public houses. He said in his speech that he &ldquo;will be&rdquo; using enabling powers in the future. He speaks of imposing environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and facilities not covered by existing legislation and regulation, including the workplace and pubs.</P>
    <P>Passive smoking in public houses is the greatest cause of the death of the 870 people I mentioned. The single biggest contributor to the loss of 870 people, to amputations and all of the illnesses I have mentioned is indirect smoking. Why did the Minister not have the guts to mention pubs in the Bill and deal with the problem up-front? I will say why. As usual, the Minister is having a bob each way. He is looking both ways. He is a Janus-faced Minister saying he will look after one's interests and telling the publicans &ldquo;Don't worry lads, I won't be too hard on you.&rdquo;. The election will be over before any of this is applied. This is the stock in trade of the Minister. I want public houses named in the Bill. If he says there is no problem, that is fine. I look forward to seeing his Committee Stage amendment dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>When I go for a pint, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I do not want to smoke somebody else's cigarette. I do not see why anybody else should have to smoke somebody else's cigarette. We had to do it in theatres, cinemas and public service vehicles in times gone by. One of the few places we are compelled to do it is in pubs. The Minister has to bite the bullet. It is an issue that has to be addressed. I am aware that the publicans are a very powerful lobby, but there are 7,000 people per year dying. I estimate about 870 people, extrapolating from the figures in the United States, are dying from passive smoking. They are smoking somebody else's cigarettes and they do not know it. If one asks Members of this House, the staff, or members of his own Department to put up their hands if they smoke, many will not put up their hands because they do not <Col N="960" /> know they are smoking. They are smoking somebody else's exhaled fumes and it is doing them untold, terrible damage. It is not mentioned in this Bill. I find it very hard to accept that any Bill purporting to deal comprehensively with this issue would deal with the matter in this way. What sort of leadership is that from the Minister who has used the first person singular so many times in the introduction to this Bill?</P>
      <P>Although the Minister said nicotine is very addictive, evidence was given to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children that suggests that nicotine is more addictive than heroin or cocaine. Obviously, it does not do the damage that heroin or cocaine do and as immediately as they do, but in the longer term smoking is one of the biggest contributors to the poor health of this nation. For this reason alone I am appalled that section 46 names the places where smoking tobacco is restricted or prohibited, but only lists places where the ban currently exists, such as schools, colleges and theatres. It does not mention public houses. This, despite the recommendation of such a ban in two separate All-Party Oireachtas Committee reports, is the indecisive Minister at his typical worst. He has promised both health campaigners and the pub lobby that he is on their side. He cannot have it both ways. I want the Minister to tell the House if he can amend this Bill to take powers to phase in a ban on smoking in public houses. I want to see it spelled out in the Bill, not in the Minister's head. You have had your Second Stage&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not. I will read out what I said. &ldquo;This.is the indecisive Minister Martin at his typical worst. He has promised both health campaigners and the pub lobby that he is on their side. He cannot have it both ways. It is time for a phased in ban on smoking in public houses. Will the Minister provide for that ban in this legislation. Will he spell it out.&rdquo; The record will show I said that.</P>
      <P>Passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke is a major health hazard that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. It is the number one indoor pollutant in Ireland, more harmful than asbestos. A Royal College of Physicians UK report concluded that smoking is strongly related to poverty and deprivation. If this were a rich person's disease, would the Minister be so lethargic? I was rapporteur for the second smoking report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and the following are among the committee's recommendations: the immediate and aggressive implementation of an extensive national lung cancer strategy; that all public houses be designated as no-smoking zones; that cigarette vending machines be banned; that all statistical data on deaths from cancer, heart disease and respiratory illnesses associated with tobacco consumption, including death certificates, state the relationship of tobacco to the cause of death; that the Government moves speedily to initiate legal proceedings against the tobacco industry. Where are the provisions for these recommendations? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says the global tobacco industry, through its extensive scientific research, knew for many decades the dangerous and addictive nature of the product it manufactures, promotes and sells. What is the Minister doing about it? In the United States, the same tobacco companies have settled &ndash; not with the federal government, with which they are settling separately &ndash; with the governments of the States. The sum involved is approximately $370 billion for what it cost individual States to treat people who suffered the effects of tobacco products. That does not take into account the settlements they are making with individuals or the settlement they will have to make with the federal government. What sort of second class people are we in Ireland that each of the States of the United States can get a settlement from tobacco companies for the amount it cost their taxpayers to give health care to those damaged by tobacco? As the Minister said, those companies knew the damage being caused to people and they have now had to pay approximately $370 billion. Not a penny has been paid to the Irish State. Why? What sort of people are we <Col N="962" /> that we are not entitled to a share in the same way as each State of the United States? There is a tobacco company in my constituency. However, the Minister should pursue these people and tell them that we expect the same compensation for Irish taxpayers that they gave the American States, each of which received compensation. We are entitled to the same compensation. It was $370 billion dollars in America but the Irish taxpayer has not received a penny.</P>
    <P>These people are arrogant, devious and secretive. In the case of at least one whistleblower in the United States, they were also dangerous. The Minister should take them on as he will be doing a public service. It would be popular and he would also have the support of the Opposition. Those people would not come to the Oireachtas committee which is looking at this issue. The invitation still stands but I know what they will do. They will send their fancy lawyers, whom they can well afford to brief, down to the courts and the courts will once again cross the line and interfere with the rights of the Oireachtas by safeguarding the rights of these people against the public interest. Our committee has already written to the Ceann Comhairle about this. The time is coming for the Oireachtas to say to the courts: &ldquo;That is your side of the line and this is ours.&rdquo;  Can any Member imagine judges being summoned here before a committee? Why did we let our guard down and allow members of an Oireachtas committee to be summoned before the courts without the permission of the Oireachtas? I am not going to refer to particular cases but the Supreme and High Courts need to look at the Constitution again. They are not the Constitution, Government or the Parliament of Ireland. They are the courts and have a particular function to which they should keep. If they do not do so the time will come for the Government of the day to put them in a more circumscribed position so that they will have to keep to their function. That needs to be said.</P>
    <P>The committee also proposed that a 50p per annum increase in tax be placed on cigarettes over the lifetime of a Parliament, with all proceeds funding national youth and adult anti-smoking strategies. Not only is there no mention of such strategies here, it flies in the face of all evidence to propose a 10p increase on a 20 pack of cigarettes and not introduce such strategies. The Minister should work on this and, if necessary, he should take it to the EU and work with his colleagues on the matter. If necessary he should work with them to take this out of the consumer price index but he must work on this. We must put cigarettes beyond the affordability of children.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that a new law prohibit persons holding office in the tobacco industry from also having a professional role in the health services. That should also be examined. The Minister should say to people: &ldquo;If you want to work for the tobacco industry, fine, but <Col N="963" /> you are not working for the health services at the same time&rdquo;. He should take the power to do so.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that the Oireachtas equip the Office of Tobacco Control with powers of enforcement and a corps of inspectors to enforce the law. Will he confirm that the necessary resources will be made available? It should also be made a criminal offence to conceal the adverse health implications of any product, including tobacco. The Minister rightly said that the industry denied for decades that nicotine was addictive, that smoking and second hand smoke cause disease and that tobacco advertising recruits children and keeps adults smoking. He also mentioned the contents of tobacco, which the industry tried to keep secret; it knew the contents were damaging people's health so it tried to keep them secret.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that at least £20 million per annum should be spent on a comprehensive anti-smoking strategy. What is the Minister doing to meet this proposal? There should also be penalties imposed on those importing tobacco illegally, given what we saw a couple of weeks ago. That recommendation is not just for reasons of tax and customs avoidance but on health grounds.</P>
    <P>The organisation, Action for Smoking and Health, ASH Ireland, has made a number of points in this regard. Specifically it states the need to have the following matters clarified: the timeframe for implementation of the Bill's various sections and a timeframe for the necessary regulations emanating from the Bill to be clearly stated as well as the need to more clearly define the terms &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;, &ldquo;sponsorship&rdquo; and &ldquo;patronage&rdquo; and the need to ensure the Internet is included. ASH Ireland questions the need to change the name of the existing Office for Tobacco Control to the Tobacco Control Agency and believes there is now an opportunity to create, on a statutory basis, the research institute for a tobacco free society in partnership with ASH Ireland either directly or in a similar manner to the tobacco free council. ASH also states that it should be illegal to sell tobacco to a minor &ndash; someone under 18 years &ndash; that all sales of cigarettes from vending machines should be banned, which was also suggested by the Oireachtas committee, and that the onus of responsibility for ensuring that tobacco is not sold to minors should be at least that relating to the sale of alcohol. The Minister should consider that.</P>
    <P>ASH Ireland recommends that smoking in all public places should be banned except in those areas permitted by way of regulation by the Minister, that the workplace is worthy of specific mention, as are public houses and that the Minister should retain the right to publish the composition of tobacco products without recourse to the High Court, which I strongly support. The organisation is aware that many Deputies have already been approached by vested interests in an attempt to weaken the Bill. Representatives of ASH Ireland <Col N="964" /> know that the tobacco industry, which is in conflict with the Oireachtas because of its failure to appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children, has briefed retail organisations on methods of lobbying Deputies to weaken the Bill. I would like the Minister to clarify if he has any information on that. I have met retailers and I would hate to think that they had been briefed by those who will not attend meetings of the joint committee.</P>
    <P>ASH Ireland is anxious to make Deputies aware of the link between the tobacco industry and retailers. Many retail premises have been refurbished by associates of the tobacco industry, at practically no charge, in return for affording prime shelf space to tobacco products. There is substantial evidence to suggest that most retailers are happy to sell tobacco products to children. Retailers have told me that they will have problems with this Bill's proposal that tobacco should be stored in a part of a shop where it is not visible. It would be better for retailers if they could store tobacco somewhere close at hand, rather than having to leave the till unattended to go to another part of the shop. It was suggested that part of the shop counter, screened from children and other customers, could be used for storage purposes. This would meet both the objectives of the Bill and the concerns of retailers. I would welcome the Minister's opinion on the idea.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children said that this Bill provides for the establishment of the Tobacco Control Agency and for the charging of a fee by the agency for registration. Will the Minister confirm that the registration fee will be a once-off payment and can he outline what the fee will be? I agree that cigarettes should not be sold in packets of less than 20, which was a recommendation of my report. I fully agree with this Bill's prohibition of the sale of confectionery resembling cigarettes, a product which is normally intended for children. It is perverse that such a product should be available. The Minister said that the agency may require manufacturers to provide information relating to the composition of tobacco products and that testing of tobacco products may also be required. I welcome these proposals, although perhaps the &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. The agency should be given every possible power to carry out these controls.</P>
    <P>During the passing of this Bill, the House should have the opportunity to deal with some of the concerns I have mentioned and I hope the Minister will address them. The Joint Committee on Health and Children should be allowed deal with this Bill as it sees fit on Committee Stage. The population of this country is over 3.8 million and I would not be surprised if the next census reveals the population to be four million. If the Irish population was equal to that of France, Irish people would collectively die 13 million years younger than the people of France do at present. That may seem like a peculiar statistic, but I have chosen it to highlight that two important factors, smoking and drinking, are killing the Irish people <Col N="965" /> before their time. I urge the Minister to take strong steps to deal with these issues, not only by prohibiting, but by putting in place a pro-active strategy. Earlier, and also in my report, I mentioned two possible strategies, an anti-smoking strategy and a fight against the drinks industry.</P>
    <P>It is perverse that our national game of hurling should be sponsored by Guinness, a company in my constituency. Many people are grateful for the employment given by Guinness, but I make no apology for saying that Guinness has gone over the top in promoting its links with hurling. Full-page advertisements have appeared in newspapers on the days of big hurling matches, suggesting that Guinness is good for everything from the cure to the celebration. It is completely over the top. The Minister said his Department is sponsoring a snooker tournament with a heavy anti-smoking promotion, but consistency is not evident in the fact that a drinks company is allowed to sponsor our national game. There is something seriously wrong as alcohol does as much damage as tobacco, if not more.</P>
    <P>I will try to strengthen this Bill by tabling amendments on Committee Stage. I hope the Minister will consider the points I have made and I ask him to introduce specific regulations in relation to pubs. It may be not be practical to ban smoking in pubs overnight, but we should try to phase it in over a period of time.</P>

      <P>In welcoming this Bill, I have to say it has been signalled so often by the Minister that many people outside the House are surprised that it has not already been passed. The Minister's announcements about smoking have become part of the ritual of Ash Wednesday, so it is something of a relief that the Bill is now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we consider the provisions of the Bill, it is important to set out the context within which this debate is taking place. Smoking-related illnesses account for 500,000 deaths in Europe every year, 7,000 of whom die in Ireland. It is <Col N="966" /> estimated that 85% of smokers started to smoke before the age of 18. It is important that we remember that the deaths of thousands of citizens are premature and preventable. If such a large amount of people died from any other cause, the Oireachtas would deem it a crisis of major proportions. Addiction to tobacco continues to be ignored and the measures taken to tackle the problem are minimal.</P>
    <P>While anti-smoking publicity campaigns have limited benefit, it is clear that the simple measure of increasing the price of cigarettes is effective and reaches those most in need of attention. The price of cigarettes is a public health issue which could have been taken on board by the Government in last week's budget, but the opportunity was not taken. Young people need to be protected from the risk of getting hooked on cigarettes. There is clear evidence that a significant increase in the price of tobacco would have a much greater impact on smokers than a series of small, phased increases. The Minister for Finance announced a small increase that will do nothing to deter young people from smoking. The budget amounted to another missed opportunity and another rejection by the Minister of Finance of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>ASH Ireland has argued trenchantly for an increase of 2 on a packet of 20 cigarettes and in 1999, Dr. Luke Clancy asked for an increase of £1. This shows that the recent 10p increase is too slim and will not make a blind bit of difference. ASH Ireland has pointed out that taxation of tobacco products has a unique role to play in the development of a price policy aimed at discouraging consumption. The influence of price on consumption is important, as there are three main effects when the price of tobacco increases, namely, a reduction in consumption, particularly among young people, a lowering of morbidity levels in the population as a whole and an increase in Government revenue.</P>
    <P>The fact that smoking levels have increased in recent years is worrying, but I am particularly worried by the increased use of tobacco by women and the alarming increase in the amount of children and young people taking up the habit. We know that teenagers are least responsive to health messages and most receptive to price levels. Research shows that young people starting to smoke are particularly susceptible to price disincentives. The World Bank Group has produced a report on the economics of tobacco control which endorses the view that price levels can and do influence consumer behaviour when it comes to smoking. The report says that scores of studies have shown that increased taxes reduce the number of smokers and the number of smoking-related deaths.</P>
    <P>It also points out that price increases induce some smokers to quit and prevent others from becoming regular or persistent smokers. They also reduce the number of former smokers who return to smoking cigarettes and reduce the consumption among <Col N="967" /> continuing smokers. It further points out that children and adolescents are more responsive to changes in the price of consumer goods than adults.</P>

      <P>St. Ita's Hospital provides services for an elderly population of more than 7,500 persons in the west Limerick area. The main structure of the building was constructed around 1840 and the remainder was constructed in 1975. As it is an old building it would require large scale development to provide high quality services for older people.</P>
      <P>St. Ita's Hospital caters for 127 patients in continuing care. It has eight rehabilitation in-patient beds. However, this is inadequate and, based on the population, the recommended norm would be 24 beds. The hospital also has six beds for respite services which is totally inadequate for the level of respite care to be provided. It has out-patient physiotherapy services for those over 65 years of age on a needs basis and occupational therapy services.</P>
      <P>I live in Newcastle West and have always been aware of the excellent service provided by the staff of St. Ita's Hospital. Over the past five years it has been agreed that a 16 bed Alzheimer's-dementia unit has to be provided. The present situation is most unsatisfactory and causes much inconvenience to staff and patients. Over the past four years we have had successive visits by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the current Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Taoiseach. There is an awareness of the necessity for this building.</P>
      <P>There is much disappointment that valuable time has slipped by and not a sod has been turned on the site for this essential building. Recent newspaper articles indicate the building was not included in the national programme for development. It would be a disaster if this essential project was to be deferred. I understand the project is at the design stage, but will the Minister of State indicate when construction will commence and confirm that appropriate finance will be provided?</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister of State to confirm to the Mid-Western Health Board that finance will be provided. I will continue to pressurise the Government on this matter. The ongoing delay is unacceptable and unfair to the patients and staff of St. Ita's Hospital. I hope the Minister of State will give me the appropriate assurance that this project will go ahead. I look forward to his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy <Col N="968" /> for raising this matter. The provision of health services in County Limerick is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board. It is a matter for the board to decide its priorities under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has been allocated indicative funding of £16.349 million &ndash; 20.76 million &ndash; under the national development plan for services for older people. In 2000, the board was allocated £1.082 million &ndash; 1.37 million &ndash; under the national development plan for services for older people. The allocation for 2001 is £1.279 million &ndash; 1.62 million &ndash; while for 2002 it is £1.88 million &ndash; 2.39 million.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from £10 million &ndash; 12.7 million &ndash; in 1997 to an additional £57.427 million &ndash; 72.91 million &ndash; in 2001, including nursing home subvention funding. Additional funding of £69.154 million &ndash; 87.807 million &ndash; will be made available in 2002 for services for older people. Of this figure, £5.571 million &ndash; 7.073 million &ndash; is allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>In 2000, as part of the national development plan, it was agreed that a project team be established for the development of a ten bed unit for the elderly or mentally infirm. It has been agreed that the development should be increased to a 12 bed unit.</P>
      <P>In January 2000, a capital grant of £400,000 &ndash; 507,900 &ndash; was provided for the unit. A number of design issues were raised in the course of 2000 which required careful consideration. It was agreed the design brief would require redrafting. At the request of the board, it was agreed the 2000 allocation would be used to undertake refurbishment works at St. Ita's Hospital and St. Camillus's Hospital, Limerick.</P>
      <P>The amended draft brief submitted to the Department by the board in early 2001 has been approved and a suitable site has been identified on the grounds of the hospital. The board's proposal in respect of establishing a design team has been agreed and the team is now in place. The design team is now working on the completion of building design proposals. Draft design plans have been drawn up and are being considered by the project team.</P>

Paul is 34 years old and has been institutionalised since the age of seven. He developed slowly until the age of four when he began to lose his speech. Two years later he was diagnosed with autistic tendencies. When he was seven years of age the family could no longer cope and the authorities recommended that he be placed in an institution. Since then he has been in the care of the Southern Health Board. The emphasis of that care has been on containment with no treatment provided to ensure the patient's well-being and development. The sad and alarming fact is that Paul has visibly deteriorated in recent months. He weighs just four and a half stones, yet he is 34 years of age. He has become more agitated and engages in self-mutilation.</P>
      <P>I met Paul's sister a month ago and she described the open wounds on his face where he had torn at his flesh. These wounds were not being treated and no effort was being made to control his self-mutilation. There was also concern that he was not receiving the appropriate medical treatment, but thankfully this has been rectified. This is a tribute to his sister and the manner in which she challenged those in charge of his care. Paul's wounds are now being treated and he is wearing appropriate helmets.</P>
      <P>Paul's agitated behaviour and distress come from years of inappropriate detention and the lack of appropriate care, treatment and intervention. The sad fact for Paul is that his family believe it may be too late for him. He should have been provided with a multifaceted behaviour support plan to deal with his challenging and self-injurious behaviour. Systems and structures should be put in place to ensure his basic right to the least restrictive environment possible and to a quality of life.</P>
      <P>If Paul has an individual care plan, as is usual for those with an intellectual disability or disorder, his family are not aware of it. He is not alone as many others are inappropriately placed in institutions where their clinical and accommodation needs are not being adequately met. This year's report from the Inspector of Mental Hospitals was critical of the fact that those with intellectual disabilities were being accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and noted that there had been no improvement since last year's report. Every year this issue is highlighted with no resulting progress.</P>
      <P>Reports of the appalling state in which Paul O'Sullivan exists are the story of one individual. However, up to 500 people are inappropriately placed in mental hospitals without the necessary intervention to ensure they can reach their potential and have the quality of life which all citizens deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to this matter. I look forward to his account of how Paul O'Sullivan's condition has deteriorated to such a state. When will people <Col N="970" /> with a mental handicap or disorder receive appropriate intervention in appropriate surroundings?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject although it is sad that the matter must be raised in the House. It is a sad reflection on our priorities as a wealthy nation that the family of this young man felt they had to resort to exposing the harrowing and intimate details of his life on the front page of a daily newspaper in order to secure the appropriate care to which he is entitled as a citizen.</P>
      <P>It is time to focus on our most needy citizens. Disability organisations which have lobbied and struggled for years on behalf of individuals and families are at one in their conclusion that this focus must establish clear rights, underpinned by law, that will provide appropriate care and services in accordance with need. If each individual is not given this basic right there will always be stories like Paul O'Sullivan's or stories of people who have been put in some slot in the system and left there. If these people are lucky the slot may respond to their needs. If they are not, they and their families must go into battle with the system, as Kathy Sinnott did on behalf of her son, Jamie, to get what they need.</P>
      <P>We have been promised that the disabilities Bill will go to Cabinet next Tuesday and will be published before Christmas. This Bill should address the needs of people like Paul O'Sullivan so they will not have to resort to publicity to get what they need. The Bill does not come before time and it has slipped down the timetable on a number of occasions already. If it is published as promised, we will be cutting it fine to have it enacted before the end of the Government's term of office.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the many organisations which have awaited this legislation for so long will have much to say about the detail of it. I attended an excellent conference last week called, Get Your Act Together, which aired the views of many interested groups. They are determined this legislation will be effective in guaranteeing them the right, like their fellow citizens, to lead fulfilling lives. We must grasp the opportunity that economic well being gives us to leave the shameful past behind us. We must provide appropriate care settings as soon as is physically possible.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it will take until 2006 to transfer all the nearly 600 people with intellectual disabilities who are inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals to appropriate centres of care. Up to now, health boards have been moving at the pace they were allowed to by their financial allocations, and it was interesting to hear the Minister of State, in answering the previous matter, referring to the allocation to the Mid-Western Health Board. However, they can only do what they can do within those financial allocations. As a member of a health board, I believe they could respond more quickly if they were given the resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> I call on the Minister to revise his target to a date much earlier than 2006 and to ask each health board to indicate the resources, including staff, it would need to expedite the transfer of those who are inappropriately placed in its region. We cannot leave people lingering in twilight lives in emotional pain any longer. We must also immediately put in place a full independent inspection system for all institutions of care, whether run by the State or privately and whether their clients are disabled, elderly, children in care or people with chronic illnesses. The light must be shone inside the locked doors and inadequacies honestly faced up to and addressed. The family of Paul O'Sullivan complained that they could only get as far as the front hall of Grove House and could not go into where he was living on a daily basis. This is the case in many institutions, whether State or privately run.</P>
    <P>I hope the exposure of the pain of Paul O'Sullivan will bring about real change for the better for him and for many other people in similar situations.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Clune and O'Sullivan for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to outline the position concerning these issues.</P>
      <P>While I cannot discuss the case of the individual in question in detail, the Minister has been informed by the Southern Health Board that the needs of every resident in Grove House are met by medical and nursing teams. This is done in consultation and agreement with their families. In fact, the medical and behavioural needs of all the residents of Grove House are assessed on a weekly basis. This assessment is carried out by the medical and nursing team at Grove House in the context of each resident's individual care plan which addresses their specific needs. Family members are welcome to contribute to this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Deputy's interpretation of the matter but it is not the Minister's.</P>
      <P>A range of therapies and activities is also available to the residents, including a fully equipped multi-sensory room, a soft play area, music, art and sonas therapy and aromatherapy, literacy classes provided by the VEC, shiatsu massage, bowling, horse riding and swimming, horticulture and social skills, self-care training and cookery.</P>
      <P>The residents also go on daily bus outings, attend football matches and shows and go shopping, and there is an extensive Special Olympics programme. Residents also go on holidays to the regional respite centre in Garrettstown and this year a group went to Doolin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> There has been some disruption to the services provided in Grove House in recent months because of a water leak which necessitated the evacuation of a large area of the ground floor to find the source of the leak. This affected a large proportion of the services, including the multi-sensory room, some living quarters and day rooms. The leak has now been found and repaired and the refurbishment programme, which had commenced before the leak was discovered, will be completed by the end of this week. The refurbishment programme included new windows, flooring and painting.</P>
    <P>The board has also assured the Minister that family members are welcome to visit and to discuss any concerns they might have about their family members with the staff who care for them. The Minister has asked the board to keep him informed of this individual's progress.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with other issues related to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism which have been raised. An integral part of the overall development programme for the services is the work which the Department and the health boards are engaged in to provide more appropriate care settings for the following groups: people with an intellectual disability or autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals; those accommodated in dedesignated units which were formerly designated as psychiatric hospitals; and others who were moved some years ago from psychiatric hospitals to alternative accommodation which is now unsuitable for their needs.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue funding of £7.25 million &ndash; 9.206 million &ndash; and capital funding of £21.58 million &ndash; 27.4 million &ndash; was allocated to this programme between 1999 and 2001. In 1996 the number of persons with an intellectual disability or autism in psychiatric hospitals was 970. In December 2001 it is 503.</P>
    <P>In addition to the various developments to provide new accommodation for those in psychiatric hospitals, Áras Attracta in Swinford, St. Raphael's in Youghal, the Seán O'Hare unit in Stranorlar and Cloonamahon in Sligo are some of the services which have also been allocated funding to provide either new or refurbished accommodation and to enhance the overall level of service available to the service users.</P>
    <P>In the Midland Health Board region, a project team has been established to plan and implement a programme to provide alternative placements and enhanced services for persons accommodated in the Alvernia Centre in Portlaoise, Lough Sheever in Mullingar and St. Peter's in Castlepollard. To date, a project manager has been appointed and 11 houses have been purchased or are in the process of being purchased. A twelfth is being refurbished. Work is already under way within these services to prepare both staff and service users for these initial moves which will commence in 2002.</P>
    <P>These are concrete examples of the progress in providing alternative facilities and enhanced lev<Col N="973" /> els of services for these groups which the Government has facilitated over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>With reference to the disabilities Bill, it is the Government's intention, as already stated, to publish this Bill before Christmas and we will be looking to having it enacted at the earliest possible date next year.</P>
    <P>While the Government is proud of the very significant progress which has been made in relation to the overall development of services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, we recognise that more needs to be done. This commitment was reflected in the further investment of 51.525 million, which is being made in these services in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>After eight months of indecision the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands granted RTE a licence fee increase of £14.50 last July instead of the sum of £50 sought by RTE. The reduced increase granted by her means RTE will be forced to operate at a loss, leading to major job cuts at the station. Her action has led directly to the axing of 200 hours of programming from RTE's schedules next year. &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo; is gone together with Lyric FM's news service and &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; presented by Olivia O'Leary. As a representative of a rural constituency, I am annoyed that &ldquo;Nationwide&rdquo; is being reduced in broadcast frequency to twice a week. Other events such as the &ldquo;Telethon&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Irish Film and Television Awards&rdquo; are also being axed.</P>
      <P>The decision to close the outside broadcast facility is a disgrace as it will lead to a severe curtailment of sports coverage. People I meet demand increased and improved sports coverage from RTE in Gaelic games, soccer, rugby, horse racing, golf and tennis, particularly on Saturdays. Sadly however, the Minister's action has led to a curtailment rather than an expansion of sports coverage.</P>
      <P>RTE once had a programme led by the late Dermot Morgan called &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo;. The Government of the day was delighted to see that programme axed. Dermot Morgan himself went on to work and prove himself a success outside Ireland. The scrapping of &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo; with some 500,000 viewers is an insult to the people and the actors in this excellent show which was produced, directed and starred in by Irish people with initiative and flair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE needs the necessary resources to develop the station's involvement in a new commercial <Col N="974" /> digital terrestrial transmission system designed to provide Internet and other interactive services. I cannot see the necessary development taking place now.</P>
    <P>I have always been disappointed by the lack of an early morning news bulletin on RTE television and I have long held the view that we should have a morning television news service together with a television equivalent of &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. RTE should also have an educational channel to provide a service to pupils in primary, post-primary and even third level education. My hopes for such services are being dashed by the Government. The Minister is reducing the ability of RTE staff to provide proper coverage of news, politics, sport, music, culture and the arts.</P>
    <P>RTE is a public broadcasting company representing people who come from all walks of life. The loss of approximately 150 jobs and the cutting of 200 programme hours is an attack on the foundations of our democratic system. It is essential that we have an energetic, active media and RTE, by providing public service broadcasting, is part of a healthy fourth estate. What Government is attempting to do is wrong. It will limit the ability of our national broadcasting service to meet the challenges of competition from other television channels.</P>
    <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language had cross-party support to grant RTE's request for a £50 television licence fee increase rather than the £14.50 increase granted. RTE has received no licence fee increase for five years and, while £50 may have been too high, the £14.50 increase was way off the mark. Even though in Opposition, in order to have a properly funded television broadcasting service, I would have supported a far larger licence fee increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set sail into choppy waters. RTE will run at a loss and will delve into its reserves. I warn the Minister, her Department and the Government that they are condemning RTE to run at a deficit in the future or continue with radical cutbacks. In the challenging times that RTE faces, this is no way to conduct affairs. The Minister is threatening RTE with commercial ruin unless she amends her policies. Having watched the Government make such a monumental mess of Aer Lingus, Eircom, the ACC and other semi-State bodies, I recommend that the Minister change her policies on RTE before it is too late.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you will remember Lena Doolin, Joe Dowling and other broadcasters meeting in the RTE canteen. Those days in RTE were symbolised by the phrase &ldquo;sit down and be counted&rdquo;. It is now time that we stand up and be counted before the Minister and her Government drive RTE down the tubes. I ask her to amend her policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 July this year the Government agreed to an increase of £14.50 in <Col N="975" /> the television licence fee with effect from 1 September. Since then I have made my position clear in relation to any further increase in the licence fee when answering questions in this House, which I have done as recently as this afternoon during Question Time.</P>
      <P>When the Government approved the interim television licence fee increase last July, it agreed that it would consider a further increase from 1 April 2003 subject to prior independent verification that certain conditions had been met. These conditions are designed to assist both the Government and RTE in providing assurances to licence fee payers that their money is being well spent. Notwithstanding the deterioration in RTE's financial position due to the downturn in advertising revenue in the meantime, the conditions laid down by the Government must still be met before I bring any new proposal for a further increase to the Government for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions laid down in the Government decision of 3 July clearly set out what must be achieved before a further increase in the licence fee could be awarded. The decision provided for completion of the RTE transformation programme currently in progress with the savings independently verified, more comprehensive and detailed reporting arrangements that reflect the requirements of the Broadcasting Act, 2001 and any additional reporting that is considered necessary for greater transparency, and that costs and revenues of each RTE service and activity be clearly identifiable in its annual reports and accounts. An independent study must also determine what, if any, organisational changes and resources are needed to ensure that the authority, as the custodian of the national public broadcasting service on behalf of the people, can carry out its statutory functions and to ensure that under<Col N="976" /> takings given by RTE as part of its application are delivered on. I have also stated that if I am satisfied that these conditions have been met earlier I will be prepared to look at the matter again.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Enright refer to certain programmes because this is not, as I am sure he will appreciate, a matter for the Minister but for the authority. Any question or complaint he might have with regard to programming should be put directly to the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response on 8 November to Parliamentary Question No. 22 on this issue from Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As acknowledged by the Secretary General of my Department in his statement to the Committee of Public Accounts on 16 October, the shortcomings highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General were indefensible irrespective of the circumstances in which they had arisen. He noted that the Department's outdated accounts system would be discarded as soon as a replacement system, being developed under the management information framework initiative, has been installed. He outlined also the remedial action being taken in the interim to ensure that my Department will provide an effective and accurate financial service within the existing con<Col N="979" /> straints. With my support, a number of actions have been initiated.</P>
    <P>A full internal review of the structures and staffing in the accounts branch of my Department has been carried out. A lack of professional accountancy expertise has been identified and this is being addressed in the short-term through consultancy help from Deloitte &amp; Touche. A further outcome of the review was the identification of a lack of resources at middle management and general clerical level. Two extra appointments have already been made, and a further six are envisaged. Turnover of personnel has also been a contributor to problems in the accounts area of my Department and efforts are being made to manage this, in so far as is feasible.</P>
    <P>Manuals have been drafted that document procedures and outline the steps that must be carried out, on a daily, monthly and annual basis, with particular emphasis on recording receipts and reconciling monthly with the PMG, the issue which gave rise to particular concern in the audit of my Department's accounts by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Most of the initial training for accounts personnel has been provided in-house, with the help of consultants. This is the only realistic approach given that most of the major problems arise from our accounts system. However, options for general training for accounts personnel, are also being identified and they will be followed up in the context of the performance management and development system process.</P>
    <P>An interim fixed assets register system has been put in place on a spreadsheet basis. My Department recognises that manual recording of capital assets in a spreadsheet format is a short-term solution, which must be superseded by fixed asset software and, accordingly, in conjunction with external consultants, is finalising a specification for this at present. When the most appropriate software is identified and acquired, a considerable amount of checking and inputting will be needed before the system is fully operational. It is the aim to have a computerised central assets register for the 2002 appropriation account.</P>
    <P>The internal audit function of my Department has been strengthened to ensure that we will in future have a more robust system of internal checks and balances. The unit is undertaking a major risk evaluation project in relation to all of my Department's responsibilities in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration. The workshop phase of this project, which involved senior divisional management, has just been completed and the resulting data is being analysed at present.</P>
    <P>In the light of these and other steps, I am satisfied that effective connective action is being taken to address the failings identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General and I am confident that my Department will meet the challenge of providing a first class accounts service into the future.</P>

      <P>The Government's objective in relation to the introduction of digital terrestrial television, DTT, in Ireland is to facilitate the establishment of the DTT platform. This objective is being pursued through two separate processes: the sale of the RTE transmission business and the selection of the DTT multiplex licensee. The recent agreement referred to by Deputy Bell does nothing to change the Government's objective, nor does it impact on the manner through which the Government's objective is to be achieved. When established, the DTT platform will be a commercial operation and will operate in a market where it will be subject to competition from other platforms.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the interdepartmental committee on the Battle of the Boyne site operates under the aegis of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and is chaired by a senior official of his Department. The committee has been mandated by the Government to bring forward proposals for the long-term development of the Battle of the Boyne site. I understand that the committee has received a report from the planning consultants on the future development of the battle site and is considering the report. It is expected that the committee will submit recommendations to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>My Department will be responsible for development and operation of the site in line with the strategy to be approved by the Government. Interim measures implemented include minor road improvements; provision of temporary car park and viewing points; provision of interpretative panels; works to 3.5 kilometres of scenic walkway; completion of initial archaeological and military history research; property maintenance and security work; and commissioning of a specialist planning consultants' study. Part of the site was opened to the public and a guide service provided during heritage week this year, 2-9 September.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I view the management plans for SACs and SPAs, and the public consultation process in particular, as a central part of the system for maintaining the favourable conservation status of these sites in the long-term. A steering committee within Dúchas, the heritage service division of my Department, oversees the preparation of plans and monitors progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conservation management plans for SACs and SPAs currently under preparation will have to be taken into account by all relevant authorities and landowners. The plans will not be finalised until after public consultations with landowners and interested parties are completed. The objective of undertaking this process is to maximise the plans' <Col N="982" /> effectiveness, and to ensure their full implementation.</P>
    <P>As matters stand at present, 241 SAC management plans and 98 SPA management plans are at various stages of completion. There is some overlap between the two, as many SPAs are contained within SACs.</P>
    <P>Out of the total of 339 SAC and SPA management plans, 292 draft plans have reached the stage of being ready to progress to public consultation. Public consultation is already under way in the case of 24 of these plans.</P>
    <P>During the public consultation phase, multiple copies of draft plans are produced as a basis for consultation initially with landowners and liaison committees. When their views have been received, a further draft is prepared to be put on public display for comments and observations from interested parties. After public comments have been received, a final version of the plan will be prepared and adopted.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to provide the Deputy with lists documenting the progress of management plan preparation for the SACs and SPAs involved.</P>

      <Quest>the archaeological staff she has available to her to monitor developments by both commercial interests and local authorities to ensure that ancient monuments are not being destroyed or damaged in the course of their work; and if she has satisfied herself that there is not an alarming rate of this type of activity around the country.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The monitoring of developments by commercial interests and local authorities is generally undertaken by private archaeologists under licence from my Department. Under the planning code, local authorities should refer details to my Department of proposed developments sponsored by both the private sector and public sector, where such development may impact on the archaeological heritage. There is a similar referral process by the Department of Marine and Natural Resources regarding forestry and marine development applications. This enables my Department to assess the potential impacts, so as to make recommendations on appropriate avoidance or mitigation measures to be taken. Such measures are normally achieved through conditions of planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department contributes to the development plan process where strategic objectives for the protection of the archaeological heritage by local authorises can be addressed as policy issues. I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the REP scheme operated by Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which requires that impacts on archaeological sites and monuments be avoided. <Col N="983" /> This scheme has over 40,000 participating farmers.</P>
    <P>My Department also has agreed codes of practice with Bord na Móna, the National Roads Authority and Bord Gáis in relation to the mitigation of their development impacts on the archaeological heritage. Further codes with other development sectors are expected to be formalised in the near future.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these measures, there remains some concern about levels of destruction to our archaeological sites and monuments. As result, I have increased the number of archaeologists working in my Department. This has enabled me to make significant improvements our archaeological services. Of the 30 archaeologists currently working in my Department, up to 11 can be involved in monitoring of developments.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the importance of having strong and up-to-date legislation to underpin all these measures and, with this in mind, I have initiated a review of the National Monuments Acts with a view to their strengthening and consolidation as the archaeological heritage faces pressures posed by the unprecedented changes being made in our historic landscape. I am pleased that the draft heads of legislation for the proposed consolidation of national monuments legislation were approved by the Government in October and are now with the office of the parliamentary counsel.</P>

      <P>In general, admission into our national cultural institutions should be without charge. However, where an institution incurs significant additional expense that cannot be met from its own resources in exhibiting material acquired on loan, a charge to cover this additional expense is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 61 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, the National Gallery of Ireland may determine fees for admission to the gallery, subject to my consent. The proposal to charge for admission to the exhibition of Impressionist paintings, on loan from the Boston Museum of <Col N="985" /> Fine Art, on the opening of the new millennium wing of the gallery next month, is a case where it is considered necessary to recoup part of the cost of acquiring the exhibition on loan.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, consent was given to the board of the National Gallery to devise a scheme of charges, bearing in mind the Government's anti-poverty and national children's strategies and Government programmes in respect of the aged and unemployed. There is no admission charge to view the gallery's own collections.</P>

These conditions are designed to assist both the Government and RTE in providing assurances to licence fee payers that their money is being well spent. Notwithstanding RTE's recent indications of its deteriorating financial circumstances, these conditions must still be met before any further increase in the television licence fee could be considered.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether the cost of living and doing business on the islands is greater than on the mainland; and the support which is available directly to islanders towards such additional costs, in particular in relation to the transport of animals and goods.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While my Department has not as yet carried out any study of the cost of living on the islands compared to that on the mainland, I understand that the recently appointed development officer of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann or the Irish Islands Federation, whose post is funded by my Department, is currently in the process of undertaking a study of the extra passenger and cargo transport costs associated with living on the islands, the results of which will be forwarded to my Department for consideration.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the results of this study, over the past number of years, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has generally recognised that certain costs incurred by island dwellers are higher than those incurred by mainland residents. As a recognition of the extra construction costs incurred by islanders, my Department's new house grant available to eligible Gaeltacht islands applicants has been increased from £6,000 to £12,000 while the house improvement grant on Gaeltacht islands has been increased from £3,450 to £12,000. In addition, the Department of the Environment and Local Government's new house grant for the islands has been raised from £4,800 to £9,600. These increases have helped considerably in offsetting the additional costs incurred by island dwellers while constructing or improving their houses.</P>
      <P>In relation to transport costs incurred by islanders, it is estimated that my Department will, in 2001, pay approximately £1.477 million in subsidies towards the provision of ferry and air services to the islands, of which approximately £740,000 relates to ferry services which transport goods in addition to passengers. The intended purpose of these subsidies is not to reduce the charges made by the relevant ferry companies for the transport of goods but to guarantee a scheduled service on occasions when it may not otherwise be profitable to provide one. It could be argued, however, that the subsidies provided by my Department have the indirect effect of reducing the cost of transporting goods, animals included, to and from the islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of my Department's work is the co-ordination of Government policy in relation to the islands which is mainly done through the work of the interdepartmental committee for the islands and resulting bilateral contacts with other Government Departments. Among the objectives achieved through this forum and which have had the effect of reducing <Col N="987" /> the cost of living on the islands are an extra £10 per week for pensioners living on the islands which was announced in budget 2000; a special rate of £52 in respect of road tax for island cars which was introduced with effect from 1 April 2001; the introduction by the Department of Education and Science since September 2001 of a significant increase, from £2,000 to £3,000, in the level of remote area boarding grant payable in respect of island children attending secondary school on the mainland.</P>

      <P>The main incentive which exists to encourage finders to notify the National Museum of Ireland of the discovery of artefacts and archaeological finds is the system of reward payments which is in place. Rewards are generous and the criteria to be used in assessing rewards are laid down in section 10 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a series of designated museums throughout the country in accordance with section 68 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, of which there are now some ten examples, assists finders who are enabled to make a report to the relevant local museum which will then inform the National Museum of Ireland. There are heavy penalties under section 13 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, should finders deliberately seek to conceal discoveries. The recent find of gold torcs is not an isolated find and over 60 similar torcs are known to have been discovered.</P>

Over the last year the furniture in the Casino has been re-evaluated and only period furniture or other material directly linked with the building is now being displayed there.</P>
      <P>Design and construction of secure accommodation for guides, security personnel and grounds maintenance equipment and the completion of security works at the entrance is also proposed. A brief for this project has been referred to the Office of Public Works for execution.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to the proper implementation of fire and emergency procedures which fully comply with the Fire Service Act, 1981, and any other relevant health and safety legislation. These include drawing up of comprehensive guidelines, training programmes and regular monthly and annual statutory inspections. A number of measures are in place in relation to fire safety, which include a 24 hour monitored fire alarm; a 24 hour security at the entrance point; access into the building is by guided tour only; and fire safety training courses for security and guide staff.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have decided in principle to propose new or extended SACs for the protection of salmon but these cannot be formally proposed and published until surveys to define their boundaries have been completed. This work is now well under way. Although it is difficult to estimate precisely, I am <Col N="991" /> advised that the necessary survey work should be completed early in 2002.</P>
      <P>The second biogeographical seminar to evaluate proposals for all habitats and species from member states in the Atlantic region of the European Union is now scheduled for March 2002. I have concluded that further SAC proposals from Ireland, should, as far as possible, be published as one final tranche. Accordingly the final tranche will be published when the boundaries for salmon sites have been determined, and in the light of the conclusions of the Atlantic region seminar.</P>

      <P>IFI, Irish Fertilizer Industries Ltd., was formed in 1987 from a joint venture between Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, NET, and Imperial Chemical Industries plc, ICI. NET then became the holding company for the State's 51% shareholding in IFI, with the remaining 49% shareholding owned by ICI.</P>
      <P>I am aware that ICI is keen to sell its shareholding in IFI. The Government would only sell the State's 51% shareholding in IFI if a suitable purchaser was found for the company. There is no active sale process at present because market conditions are not considered suitable for a successful sale.</P>
      <P>IFI mainly produces chemical fertilisers. I understand that IFI's plant and equipment is not suited to the manufacture of organic based fertilisers or composts. The company have advised me that all animal manure is already recycled by farmers and that, with good nutrient management planning, fertiliser is used to supply the outstanding balance of nutrients for crop production after taking due account of the contribution from animal manure. IFI strongly advocates proper nutrient management planning and strongly supports Teagasc and the retail trade in its promotion.</P>
      <P>As well as animal manure, other potential sources of organic based fertilisers are sewage and organic waste. IFI participated with a UK company in a feasibility study of the farm utilisation of dried sewage sludge in counties Meath and Louth in 1996 and 1997. It necessitated the movement of bulky material with quite low nutrient concentrates large distances. IFI did not deem it to be a commercial proposition.</P>
      <P>IFI carried out a major feasibility examination of anaerobic digestion of waste materials in the 1996-1998 period. It was concluded that the investment was not warranted due to the high cost of transporting the relatively low concentration residual liquid to farms and the cost of its application to the soil. The combination of income from &ldquo;gate&rdquo; fees for waste removal, as well as income from the biogas yield and from the value of the residual liquid to farmers did not seem to be sufficient to make the project viable.</P>

      <P>My Department, and the industrial development agencies under its aegis, are acutely aware of the need to achieve a more equitable spread of industrial development across the regions than has been the case heretofore. In the midwest region, which includes north Kerry, IDA Ireland is the agency with responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, working closely with Shannon Development. At present, there is an IDA Ireland-supported company in Castleisland &ndash; Aetna USA &ndash; which is a processing centre for evaluating and processing health insurance claims, and currently employs 74 people.</P>
      <P>As well as combining with IDA Ireland in attracting foreign direct investment, Shannon Development also works with indigenous companies in the region. Shannon Development has five indigenous companies in Castleisland employing a total of 49 people as at December 2000. The company is currently finalising its examination of plans submitted by the Castleisland Development Association, in which they have applied for a certificate to develop an advance factory under the BES scheme in Castleisland industrial estate. The factory will be 1,237 sq.m. and will be available for promotion as a location for new indigenous industry or foreign direct investment. Shannon Development will be working closely with the group as the project comes on stream, and will also liaise with IDA who will have the premises on their available list of location options in north Kerry.</P>
      <P>In addition to this specific initiative, Shannon Development's normal industry support programmes continue to be available to any initiatives emanating from, or seeking to locate in Castleisland and close contact is maintained with the Castelisland Development Association in this regard. On a general level, the recent development of Kerry Technological Park in Tralee will have positive results in terms of the entire north Kerry region. A key strategy being put in place by Shannon Development is that a number of outreach programmes and satellite centres will feed in or benefit from the work that will take place in Kerry Technological Park.</P>

      <P>A company that has been dissolved no longer legally exists. Accordingly, it cannot continue to trade or carry out the operations referred to by the Deputy. It would be a matter for the relevant authorities to introduce procedures to ensure that grant assistance, licences, etc, were not provided to a company that had ceased to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, however, possible for a company to be restored to the register. Under section 311A of the Companies Act, 1963, a company that has been dissolved can be restored to the register of companies by making an application to the Registrar of Companies within 12 months of its dissolution. Alternatively, under section 311 of the <Col N="996" /> Companies Act, 1963, a company, member or creditor can seek to have a dissolved company restored to the register, within a period of 20 years from its dissolution, by seeking a High Court order to that effect. A company that is restored to the registry is deemed to have continued in existence as if its name had not been struck off.</P>
    <P>Section 381(1) into the Companies Act, 1963, as amended by section 98 of Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001, provides that it is an offence for a person to trade or carry on business under a name or title of which &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is the last word, unless duly incorporated with limited liability. Under section 240 of the Companies Act, 1990, as amended, a person summarily convicted of an offence under section 381 of the Companies Act, 1963 may be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,500 &ndash; 1,904 &ndash; or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. A person convicted on indictment may be liable to a fine not exceeding £10,000 &ndash; 12,692 &ndash; or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.</P>
    <P>Where a person is in breach of section 381(1) and fails within 14 days after the service of a notice on him or her to cease to trade or carry on business under a name or title of which &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is the last word unless duly incorporated with limited liability, section 382(2) of the Companies Act, 1963 empowers the Registrar of Companies or the Director of Corporate Enforcement to apply to court for an order directing the person who has committed the offence to cease to so trade or carry on a business.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he is taking to tackle the serious situation confronting the whitefish industry by the action of the European Commissioner, Franz Fischler, in his demand for a reduction in the whitefish catch of 60%; and if he will enlist the aid of the British Government to join in the efforts to combat this measure.</Quest>

      <P>Fisheries quotas for 2002 will be the subject of detailed discussions and negotiations at a meeting of the EU Council of Fisheries Ministers on the 17 and 18 December 2001. The scientific advice on the status of many whitefish stocks is of concern at the present time and there is a growing consensus that a variety of tailored actions is needed to rebuild stocks in order that the fisheries concerned can be developed in a sustainable manner for the ultimate benefit of fishermen. The European Commission has proposed average reductions in total allowable catches of 33% across the broad range of whitefish stocks, with cuts of up to 60% in some species.</P>
      <P>While I accept that there is serious concern about some stocks, I do not accept the Commission's blunt approach, which in some cases goes beyond the scientific advice. The Commission must take account of the needs of fishermen as well as the fish stocks. In the context of the upcoming quota discussions, I will be approaching the issue with the aim of striking the appropriate balance between the conservation imperative and ensuring viable economic opportunities to protect the livelihoods of the fishermen concerned.</P>
      <P>I have already consulted the representatives of our fishermen in relation to the Commission's proposals. I met with the UK Fisheries Minister, in London, and Minister Bríd Rodgers this week on matters of mutual concern in relation to fisheries quotas. I will also meet with the Belgian Fisheries Minister, who holds the EU Presidency, in Brussels this week to outline Ireland's position in relation to the Commission's proposals. In addition, I will be having a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Fischler on Ireland's priority concerns at the Fisheries Council next Monday.</P>

This arrangement gives us a clear and balanced view of events and direct and immediate access to both parties. As I told the House on 16 October, if Ireland is to exercise influence in this situation, it is essential that we are accepted as an impartial and fair-minded partner by both sides.</P>

I have no plans to make representations to the United States Government on this matter.</P>
      <P>However, the use of weapons of war, such as attack helicopters and strike aircraft, in heavily populated areas is a matter of grave concern and is both disproportionate and inappropriate. As I said to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs on 4 December, there is no military solution to this conflict, only a political one. I have consistently urged the Government of Israel to cease its military action against the Palestinian Authority and to renew negotiations towards a comprehensive settlement. I repeated this position when I met the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Shimon Peres, in Brussels on Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>At the Transport Council meeting on 6 December last, I again made my case to the Commission about the need for an expansion of the horizontal four-day compensation measure for EU airlines as a result of the events of 11 September 2001.</P>
      <P>I stated that I was very satisfied that the airline industry had responded to an exceptional situation quickly and appropriately by taking painful and often drastic measures to respond to market conditions. However, the scale and exceptional nature of the crisis also demanded a measured but adequate response from the Commission and from member states.</P>
      <P>I pointed out again that the four-day compensation measure agreed at the Transport Council on 16 October was minimalist and inadequate having regard to the scale of the crisis and the US emergency aid package. I repeated that we must not allow terrorism to damage our industry and that these dreadful circumstances should not be used by anybody pursuing a consolidation agenda to fast-track their aims. I stated that Ireland had already notified the Commission of the details of our scheme for the payment of the four-day compensation to Irish airlines. A number of claims have been received from Irish airlines and payment has already been made to Aer Lingus. Payment will also issue to another Irish airline this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my concluding remarks, I said that Ireland would be availing of the provision agreed at the <Col N="1000" /> October Council that member states may make a case for compensation beyond the four days based on objective criteria. We have already advised the Commission of our intention in that regard. I referred again to the strategic importance of Aer Lingus transatlantic services and that we therefore retained the right to make any proposal to the Commission regarding any form of investment in Aer Lingus which the Irish Government may deem appropriate.</P>
    <P>While some member states did express support for Ireland's position, no agreement was reached about an expansion of the measure. In particular, the Commission remained resolute that the horizontal measures already agreed were adequate.</P>
    <P>In addition to the four days compensation measure, Aer Lingus has furnished information about the full costs of the impact of the terrorist attacks for the month of September. My officials will be notifying the Commission of this amount and advising that we have asked the company to provide the relevant figures to the end of December when they become available. On receipt of that information I will submit a case to the Commission under the provision agreed at the October Council.</P>
    <P>Specifically regarding the Aer Lingus survival plan, as the House will be aware, the Labour Relations Commission issued proposals on 28 November on pay and work practice changes relating to the plan. In addition, in accordance with the Government decision of 23 October, talks between officials in the Departments of Public Enterprise and Finance and the unions are progressing on an increased shareholding up to a total of 14.9% by the Aer Lingus employees in the company, including the quantum of existing shares held by staff. I am hopeful that a satisfactory outcome will be achieved shortly. I welcome the fact that SIPTU has already commenced a ballot of its members on the LRC proposals. IMPACT has yet to indicate when it will commence a ballot of its members. All parties are aware of the need for urgent agreement on the plan which is vital to ensure the survival of a fundamentally restructured Aer Lingus capable of providing the maximum number of sustainable jobs.</P>

In line with the relevant EU regulations, since an area aid application was not submitted by the person named within the extended timeframe, no disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme payment can be made for 2001.</P>

      <P>He applied for the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme on only six cows which resulted in his quota being reduced to six premium rights.

      <P>The provisions for 2003 and 2004 for each individual Vote, in line with previous practice, allows only for known pay increases arising from, among other things, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the final phase of which is due to be paid on 1 October 2002. No increase in pay rates for any successor agreement to the PPF is included in the individual Votes. The PPF will expire in the public service in 2003. I am satisfied that the unallocated element of voted current expenditure in 2003 and 2004 will be adequate to deal with the additional expenditure items arising in those years, including post-PPF pay increases, that have not been provided for in the Departmental figures for those years.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to forecast the cost of any recommendations that might arise from the public service bench-marking exercise but as a prudent measure a limited provision of 150 million has been made towards the cost of implementing that body's report for 2002. This 150 million is also included in the above provisions for 2003 and 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring in the question to the special savings incentive account scheme, SSIA. This new scheme commenced on the 1 May 2001 and every eligible person has the opportunity to start a SSIA account during the following 12 months, that is, an SSIA can be opened at any time up until the closing date for the scheme, 30 April 2002. In order to open a SSIA, an individual must be aged 18 or over and be resident for tax purposes in this State on the date the account is opened. During the period that the SSIA continues, the individual must be either resident or ordinarily resident here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, like most other states, imposes income tax on people resident in the State in respect of all their income no matter from where it is sourced, that is, including world-wide income; and, in the case of all other persons, in respect of income which is sourced in the State. An individual's residence status for Irish tax purposes is determined by the number of days he or she is present in Ireland during a given tax year. An individual is considered to be resident in Ireland for a particular tax year in either of the following circumstances: If he or she spends 183 days &ndash; 135 days in the short tax year of assessment 2001, &ndash; or more in Ireland for any purpose in that tax year; or if he or she spends 280 days &ndash; 244 days in the short tax year of assessment, 2001 &ndash; or more in Ireland for any purpose over a period of two consecutive tax years he or she will be regarded as resident of Ireland for the second tax year. A day for residence purposes is one on <Col N="1009" /> which an individual is present in Ireland at midnight.</P>
    <P>The concept of resident for tax purposes is a very useful one which allows the legislation to focus on a particular class of individuals, that is, those who are liable to tax in the State on their world-wide income &ndash; both income sourced in the State and anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;residence&rdquo; refers to an individual's pattern of residence over a number of tax years. If one has been deemed resident in Ireland for three consecutive tax years, one is regarded as ordinarily resident from the beginning of the fourth tax year. This tax status may be retained for up to three years even if an individual is abroad during this time. In the context of the SSIA scheme this means that an individual resident here on commencement of an SSIA and who subscribes to an SSIA may then be able to work abroad for three consecutive tax years without losing his or her rights to continue to subscribe to the scheme. However, such a person must return to Ireland in the year following the three year period and be deemed resident in order to continue to be eligible for the scheme.</P>
    <P>Unless one is either resident or ordinarily resident as described above, one cannot subscribe to an SSIA, irrespective of one's work status abroad. That is, it does not matter if one is working for the Government, a State body or a private company abroad &ndash; one is only eligible to participate in the SSIA scheme if one fulfils the tax residence requirements already mentioned. It should be noted, however, that an individual who is resident in the State for tax purposes and working outside the jurisdiction, say in Northern Ireland, would be eligible to participate in the scheme. I have no plans to make any changes to the legislation in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>the situation regarding persons who complain that first time house buyers were unfairly treated in the Budget vis-à-vis the investor; his views on whether this new measure will put pressure on first time buyers; if a reduction in stamp duty can be offered to them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in the budget, the presence of investors in the housing market is required to secure the future supply of housing to meet accommodation needs. Circumstances in the property market are much changed now as compared to the position in early 1998. The Government has always been vigilant in introducing and amending policies as necessary to deal with an evolving market situa<Col N="1010" /> tion. In this context the recent evidence of a slow down in house prices, accompanied by a fall in housing output, would have had serious implications for activity and employment in the house-building sector, for housing supply for purchasers, and for the supply of property for rent if not responded to by Government. It is particularly relevant to note that total housing output represents 11% of GNP and accounts for around 100,000 or more persons directly employed, not to mention those indirectly dependent on the sector. Furthermore, a decline in new house completions would have ultimately begun to put upward pressure on house prices again and a fall in housing output would have worsened conditions for both the first-time purchaser and the rental market and led to further upward pressure on rents.</P>
      <P>The stamp duty changes that I introduced in the budget simply put investors in new and second-hand houses onto the same rate as non first time owner-occupiers &ndash; the advantage enjoyed by first-time buyers in the second-hand residential property market remains, as the table below confirms. Moreover, all owner-occupiers including first time buyers are exempt from stamp duty for new residential property under 125 square metres. In addition to the stamp duty changes mentioned above, I also have restored interest relief as a deductible expense in calculating tax on rental income from residential property with effect from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the new rates of stamp duty will put pressure on first-time buyers. The market for housing has benefited the latter as a result of the significant slowdown in the rate of house price increases and as a result of the cumulative beneficial effect of reductions in stamp duty payable by first-time purchasers during my time as Minister. However, one must strive at all times to maintain market equilibrium &ndash; changing stamp duty rates applying to residential property is always a balancing act since one has to have regard to the various participants in the market as well as to their needs while placing these in the context of the broad economic effect.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the effect of the budget changes will be to contribute to the maintenance of employment in the housing construction sector, aided by increased investor interest; a stimulus to new house construction as the expected increase in activity in the second-hand property market, thanks to the abolition of the single 9% flat rate, has a beneficial knock-on effect on new house sales &ndash; many of which are bought by existing owner occupiers; and an increase in the quantity of property available in the rental market.</P>
      <P>The current stamp duty rates payable on the transfer of new and second-hand residential property are as follows:</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parent's nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. Instructions as to how the payments should be made issued from my Department on 17 October last and funding specifically for this purpose was made available to commence the making of these payments from 1 November 2001. The letter which issued from my Department instructed health boards to examine every application for subvention received since 1993 and to make payments to applicants of an amount equal to the sum by which the subvention was abated, as a result of the provisions in the regulations which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters to contribute to the cost of their parent's care. The letter further advised, <i>inter alia</i>, on the procedures to be followed in making these payments to the individual, whether by cheque or directly to a bank account.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Southern Health Board that costings are still being carried out in the board's area and consequently, the precise total cost of payments has not yet been calculated. Nonetheless, the board has advised that the cost of cases already calculated is £515,433.</P>

      <P>I propose to introduce the landfill levy early in 2002 following consideration of the submissions received in response to the consultation paper recently issued by my Department. This proposed that the levy should be introduced at an initial flat rate of 15 per tonne, with annual increases thereafter of 5 per tonne. Liability for the levy will fall on the operator of a landfill facility, whether that is a natural person, a private company or a local authority.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a landfill levy will help achieve the targets set in the Government's policy document changing our ways, by encouraging the diversion of waste away from landfill towards recycling and biological treatment options; generate revenues for the new environment fund that can be applied in support of waste minimisation and &ldquo;high-in-hierarchy&rdquo; recycling initiatives; and support improved enforcement initiatives by local authorities with regard to control of unauthorised waste activities.</P>

      <P>I have recently allocated a total of 593 million, £467 million, to local authorities from the local government fund for 2002. This represents an increase of 10% over the 2001 baseline allocation and is some 75% higher than the corresponding allocation in 1997. I am confident that this level of resources is sufficient to meet the reasonable cost of local authority services, including the improved arrangements associated with better local government.</P>

      <P>The two year limit in question does not derive from regulations, but from section 96(15) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. This provides that permissions for residential development on zoned land applied for after 25 August 1999 but before the housing strategy is included in the relevant development plan in accordance with the Act, will last until 31 December 2002 or for two years, whichever is longer. This provision was included in Part V of the Act, with full agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas to prevent developers stockpiling planning permissions which would not be subject to the requirement to reserve land or houses for social and affordable housing. It will therefore ensure that the Act applies fairly and equally to all developers as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Virtually all local authorities have now varied their development plans to incorporate their housing strategy. Once housing strategies have been incorporated in development plans, planning permissions will be granted for five years.</P>
      <P>There is no proposal to amend Part V of the Act which reflects the full and recent consensus of the legislature on an important policy matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has implemented a range of measures to afford greater participation in the housing market for first time buyers and reduce pressure on house prices. These include changes to stamp duty thresholds and rates to ease the burden on first time buyers of second hand houses, to improve their position in relation to other owner occupiers and investors, and to discourage speculative demand, especially at the lower end of the market. In the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, the exemption threshold for first time buyers of second hand properties was increased from £60,000 or 76,184 to £150,000 or 190,500.</P>
      <P>As a result of these measures, first time buyers now have an increased share of the housing market. This is evidenced both in the increased level of applications for the new house grant, which rose by 7.9% nationally for the first 11 months of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000, and in the loan applications data. In addition, the rate of house price increases continues to moderate, as will be further evidenced in the Housing Statistics Bulletin &ndash; September 2001 Quarter &ndash; which will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>These developments in relation to house prices and the improved position of the first time buyer have allowed the Government to introduce measures in budget 2002 to increase the supply of housing generally, and within the rental sector in particular. The budget measure in relation to interest deductibility, and the changes to the stamp duty regime whereby a common rate will now apply both to investors and to non-first time buyers, will encourage an increase in the supply of rental accommodation. However, the first time purchaser will continue to benefit from lower stamp duty rates than either other owner-occupiers or the investor.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet <Col N="1021" /> their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6 or 7.62. This £6 or 7.62 represents the minimum contribution which people are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation cost. In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
      <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons e.g. single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc. as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
      <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board were contacted on behalf of the individual concerned and have advised that she is in receipt of the maximum amount of rent supplement payable to someone in her circumstances. The board has further advised that she is paying rent which is in excess of the appropriate maximum rent level. When she made her application for a rent supplement the community welfare officer advised her that she should attempt to secure more reasonably priced accommodation and explained that the assessment would be based on the appropriate maximum rent level applicable in the health board. Details of how the amount of rent supplement in payment was calculated are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>

      <P>The position is that the <i>Asgard</i> Restoration Project, with the consent of the Minister for Defence, who is the owner of the vessel, has assumed responsibility for its restoration. My only involvement in the matter was limited to securing Government approval to issue the group a &ldquo;Licence to Alter&rdquo; the vessel, as required by the National Monuments Acts, so that restoration might proceed. The licence was issued on 23 December 1999.</P>

      <P>Artefacts are primarily found at historic sites through archaeological excavations licensed through Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. Over the past five years, the numbers of licences issued for archaeological excavation is 3,997. The breakdown is  as follows; 1997: 487; 1998: 615; 1999: 760; 2000: 960; 2001: 1,175.</P>

    <P>Some excavations may produce few finds, if any, while at others the numbers of finds can run to many thousands of artefacts. It would not be practicable to list or enumerate the numbers involved here. It is a condition, of each excavation licence that the licence holder should submit a report of work undertaken to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and to the National Museum of Ireland and that such reports may be consulted subject to certain conditions. In due course, all such finds must be deposited with the National Museum of Ireland or with such other institution as may be defined <Col N="1026" /> under Section 68 of the Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, as a designated place of safety.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that in 2002 my Department will continue to implement the built and natural elements of the national development plan. In this regard work has been ongoing on many important capital projects such as the replacement of the perimeter paths at St. Stephen's Green, the development of the Mainguard in Clonmel, County Tipperary, and ongoing restoration and improvement works at Clonmacnoise, County Offaly. New projects scheduled to commence in 2002 include the re-roofing of Drumacoo Mausoleum, County Galway, the development of a visitor facility at Quin Abbey, County Clare, the development of visitor facilities at Doneraile Court, County Cork and the restoration of the Palm House at the Botanic Gardens. My Department also has a large number of projects at various stages of design or planning on which it is hoped to make substantial progress in 2002.</P>
      <P>While work has commenced on 71 national development plan capital projects in the built heritage area, it is difficult to be definitive about completion dates, given the range of factors that can affect progress in individual cases.</P>

      <P>My Department, in accordance with the provisions of Section 26 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, as amended, has issued 1200 new archaeological licences since the beginning of this year. No ringforts are currently being excavated. However 48 of the licences issued refer to excavations that have taken place in proximity to known and possible ringfort sites. The remaining excavation licences <Col N="1027" /> for this year were issued for excavations at sites of various types throughout the country. Most of these relate to planning and development cases.</P>
      <P>Among the ongoing public sector excavations, conducted under the auspices of my Department, are Barryscourt Castle, County Cork, Skellig Michael, County Kerry, and Drumfad Lower, Portsalon, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently launched a public consultation document, &ldquo;New initiatives for procedures and practice in archaeological licensing&rdquo;, which contains proposals for increasing efficiencies in the licensing system. A high priority initiative is the dissemination and publication of results of archaeological excavations. The public consultation process will last until 31 January 2002, following which revised procedures will be adopted and issued.</P>
      <P>I am arranging to forward a copy of the document to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my reply of 8 November 2001 to Parliamentary Question No. 150, Maynooth Castle was opened to the public on 27 July last. Work on the exhibition to be installed in the castle is on target for completion and installation in the 2002 season.</P>
      <P>Once the installation of the exhibition is complete, my Department will be in a position to assess the needs of the site in terms of visitor numbers and facilities and make a determination as to the level, if any, of additional works required to ensure its successful operation.</P>
      <P>The total spend to the end of November 2001 on the works to Maynooth Castle is £1,013,291.36. As indicated previously, I am satisfied that the project undertaken can be completed within the available budget of £1.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, on the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that as part of a package jointly launched by me and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings is being administered by local authorities. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority, Kildare County Council in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The owner or occupier of a building determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to <Col N="1029" /> allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that last year I launched my strategy under the national development plan for the continued conservation and protection, in the period up to 2006, of the sizeable portfolio of more than 740 national monuments and historic properties in the care of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. Having conducted a detailed review of the properties under my control, in excess of 100 sites have been identified which will require major work from either a conservation, protection or presentation point of view during the above period. To this end, I have agreed to provide funding in excess of £65 million to allow this essential work to be undertaken over a six-year period.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that, notwithstanding the substantial funding which I have already allocated to the Castletown House project to date, I have ensured that it will benefit further from the funds allocated to me under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. There is a wide range of works yet to be undertaken including restoration, provision of improved visitor reception facilities, parking and works to the grounds and outbuildings. It is intended to carry out these works on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>While it is neither feasible nor desirable for the State to control all heritage properties, I am conscious of the need to support the protection of the heritage not in State care. The national heritage plan, which will be published next year, will outline the future approach to the protection of heritage properties in private ownership. This will include the use of the Planning and Development Acts, the completion of surveys such as the national inventory of architectural heritage and increased levels of training in skills and craft areas, which are crucial to the protection of heritage in private ownership.</P>

      <P>On 1 November 2001, the total number of prisoners in all prisons was 3,177 and total prison staff, including management, trades, industrial and medical staff, was 3,143. The ratio of prisoners to prison staff on that date was, therefore, 1.01:1. This is an overall ratio and individual ratios vary from prison to prison.</P>
      <P>Details on average prisoner to prison staff ratios in prison services in the European Union are contained in the following table which has been extracted from the Council of Europe Annual Penal Statistics &ndash; SPACE 1, &ldquo;Populations of Penal Institutions&rdquo;&ndash; Survey 2000 issued in January this year. The table shows statistics for 1 September 2000, the most recent date available. It should be noted that the Council of Europe statistics, including those for Ireland, relate to custodial staff excluding management staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors account for the lower prisoner-staff ratio in Ireland. These include older prison estates; smaller institutions with a resulting less favourable economy of scale; and more liberal prisoner regimes. The Irish Prison Service is addressing the current low prisoner to staff ratio through the modernisation of prison facilities including greater use of technology. In general, <Col N="1031" /> staffing levels and arrangements are the product of operational circumstances which have been in place over many years against a background, at times, of very considerable tension and difficulty. The assessment of the man hours required to deliver agreed regime activities and services and the development of associated systems of staff attendance and deployment practices are being addressed in a comprehensive and strategic way through the ongoing staffing and operations review team, SORT, and the strategic effectiveness programme, STEP, process. This process, involving detailed consultations with Prison Service management and the Prison Officers' Association, is at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>Delays in issuing death certificates and the consequent need for interim death certificates can arise in cases where inquests are involved. In this connection, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 127 of Wednesday, 3 October 2001 in <Col N="1032" /> which I indicated that a final coroner's certificate is issued only when an inquest has been completed. From the relatives perspective there is, therefore, a practical requirement for a certificate of death to issue as soon as possible after death. In practice, coroners usually issue an interim death certificate or some written confirmation of the fact of death in advance of the inquest.</P>
      <P>Arising from the recommendations of the report of the working group on the review of the coroner service, I intend to put such interim documents on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The criteria for issuing these documents will be examined in detail by a recently established rules committee &ndash; also recommended by the review group. The work of this committee is an essential part of the preparation for proposed new coroner legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. I am increasing the grant for care<Col N="1033" /> takers and secretaries from £40, 50.79, per pupil per annum to £100, 126.98, per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant has been increased from £40, 50.79, to £60, 76.18, per pupil. This will be further increased to £80, 101.58, per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37, to £4,800, 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76, to £40,000, 50,789.52, per annum.</P>
    <P>In line with the new arrangements, the school referred to by the Deputy recently received a further payment of £2,200, 2,793.42, towards the cost of ancillary services.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million, 2,539,476, to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new funding arrangements outlined above that have been put in place by my Department, my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, has established an interdepartmental working group to review the existing schools meals scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of school meals provision. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs operate the current schools meals scheme in co-operation with various local authorities. My Department is represented on this working group. It is expected that the report of the working group will be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, if the school referred to by the Deputy wishes to make a submission to my Department in relation to this matter, I can confirm that it will be examined in the context of the consultant's report on transitional difficulties that some schools may be experiencing as a result of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I can also confirm that my Department's representatives on the working group reviewing the school meals scheme will bring any submission to the attention of that working group. It is important, however, that the submission would contain full details on the background to the particular situation per<Col N="1034" /> taining in this school, including details of when CE participants in the school are due to complete their periods of employment on such schemes. Any submission should be sent to the primary administration section 2 of my Department in Athlone.</P>

My Department will receive a total of £32 million or 40,631,618 in this school year.</P>
      <P>At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the school services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20 or 25.40 per pupil to £50 or 63.49 per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70 or 88.88 per pupil next September and to £78 or 99.04 per pupil in January 2003. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. These increases are in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes.</P>
      <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000 or 5,078.96 to £15,600 or 19,807.91 per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000 or 12,697.38 to £39,000 or 49,519.79 over this school year and the next. In the case of second level schools receiving grants of £55 or 69.84 per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to a maximum of £19,250 or 24,442.46 per school, the annual grant of £78 or 99.04 under the services support fund will bring the combined total for a 500 pupil school to £58,250 or 73,962.24 per year.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued circulars to all second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. It is intended that payments will issue to schools shortly.</P>
      <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates concessionary teaching hours and special needs assistants to second level schools to cater for the special needs pupils. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service.</P>
      <P>The authorities of the school attended by the pupil referred to by the Deputy recently applied for additional teaching resources and a special needs assistant to cater for his special educational needs. The application was immediately referred to the psychological service for a report and recommendation. As soon as this report is received a decision will be taken on the application and the school authorities will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <P>Psychologists in the national educational psychological service discuss with school principals, and agree on, the priorities for psychological intervention in each school. This includes the number of individual assessments to be carried out. Normally the psychologist offers advice to <Col N="1038" /> teachers on appropriate programmes and supports for pupils who are giving concern and only engages in individual casework if the school based interventions appear insufficient over a period. In this case the school principal felt that it would be possible to provide support for the pupil with advice from the psychologist but without an individual psychological assessment being carried out at this time.</P>
      <P>Psychological support continues to be available to the pupil. The psychologist will offer advice on the most appropriate learning support programme for the pupil. Her progress will be monitored each time the psychologist visits the school. If there is concern about the rate of progress then an individual psychological assessment may well be considered necessary at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997 my Department launched the schools IT2000 initiative designed to integrate modern information and communications technology into teaching and learning within the first and second level education systems. Over £40 million &ndash; 52 million &ndash; has been spent on the programme to date from central funds. In addition a further £20 million &ndash; 26 million &ndash; has been invested by public and private sector partners in the overall venture.</P>
      <P>The specific objectives of schools IT 2000 were to put into place a permanent infrastructure to ensure that every student would have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and equip himself or herself for participation in the information society and to give support to teachers in developing and renewing professional skills to enable them to utilise ICTs as part of the learning environment of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These objectives were delivered through a series of initiatives. The technology integration initiative, TII, was the grant aiding of ICT infrastructure at first and second level schools. The <Col N="1041" /> teaching skills initiative, TSI, was a comprehensive training scheme providing ICT training for all teachers at first and second level education. School integration projects, SIP, were a number of school based projects determining the efficacy of information and communication technologies in the classroom. The focus of these innovative projects is to examine a range of ICT strategies and methodologies relevant to the broad spectrum of educational practices.</P>
    <P>Schools IT 2000 has achieved the following: the pupil to computer ratios are now 17.7 for primary and 13 for post-primary schools, improved from 35 and 16, respectively, in 1998; every school now has a connection to the Internet, up from 25% in 1998, and 62% of second level schools now have multi-users web access, mainly <i>via</i> ISDN; 18% of primary schools and 78% of second level schools now have computer networks in place, an increase of 14% and 28%, respectively; 15% of primary schools and 46% of second level schools have websites, up from 3% and 22% respectively, and approximately 50,000 IT training places have been provided and 75% of all teachers have attended an ICT course since early 1998.</P>
    <P>I have secured a further £85 million &ndash; 107.92 million &ndash; for a new three year programme of ICT in schools, the details of which I expect to announce shortly. The first £21 million &ndash; 26.6 million &ndash; of this allocation will be released to schools before the end of this year. Current expenditure has also continued during 2001 on each of the major initiatives created under schools IT 2000, that is, teaching skills, Scoilnet, schools integration project and software development and evaluation, which are administered on behalf of my Department by the national centre for technology in education.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end. <Col N="1042" /> The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. In line with the new arrangements, the school referred to by the Deputy recently received a further payment towards the cost of ancillary services. I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash; 2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and, therefore, reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
      <P>Schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from Special Education Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>The issue to which the Deputy refers has been brought to my attention. Editors of textbooks and activity books for use in primary schools select the content of such books. The material selected for inclusion in textbooks reflects the preferences of the editor. When selecting material for textbooks, editors are required to follow guidelines drawn up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to ensure that the textbooks conform to the requirements of the curriculum.</P>
      <P>Parents and members of the public are fully entitled to express their concerns about matters relating to curricula in primary schools. Editors of textbooks should follow the specifications for textbooks provided by the NCCA, including the need to ensure the appropriateness of the selected material to the age and the developmental level of the pupils for whom the books are intended.</P>
      <P>I have referred the issues raised by the Deputy to the NCCA to see if their guidelines for publishers address the concerns of the parents. However, the parents themselves should bring the issues of concern to them directly to the publishers of the textbook and to the school authorities.</P>

In October 2001 my Department authorised the school authorities to proceed to invite tenders for the roof replacement element of these works. Following receipt of the tender report from the school's consultant architect my Department issued a letter to the school authorities in November 2001 authorising them to accept the lowest tender for these works.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether it is entirely unfair that the special maintenance grant payable for third level students is not payable in a case (details supplied); and if he will amend the regulations in order to ensure that a person in this situation is covered.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action group considered that the target group, those most in need, could best be defined <Col N="1047" /> in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he or she must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>All four schemes have similar provisions relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant. Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired.</P>
    <P>It appears no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of <Col N="1048" /> the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, might be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>
