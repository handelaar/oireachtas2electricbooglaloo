    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 29, Revised Estimates for Public Services, 2001 &ndash; Votes 1 to 43; No. 55<i>b</i>, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a proposal under the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam &ndash; proposal for a Council regulation establishing a general framework for Community activities to facilitate the implementation of a European judicial area in civil matters; No. 57, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 1, Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m., and the sitting shall be suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m.; (2) No. 29, Votes 1 to 43, shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; (3) No. 55<i>b</i>, shall be decided without debate; and (4) Report and Final Stages of No. 57 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 12 noon by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Private Members' Business shall be No. 82, European Union Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. Is the late sitting agreed to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. On Private Members' Business last night, the Government indicated that it was accepting the principle of the Labour Party's Bill in relation to the scrutiny of European legislation. There is a proposal before the House today which has already been ordered in anticipation of referral to a committee of secondary legislation from the Government &ndash; this appeared at late notice and the House will not have an opportunity to scrutinise it &ndash; to be disposed of in its entirety later today. This flies against the spirit of the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night and indicates that the Government has learned nothing from the outcome of the referendum on the Nice Treaty. There are other reasons the Order of Business should be opposed, but for that reason alone the Labour Party opposes the late sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the proposal for the late sitting will not prove adequate because the Green Party is not in a position to state whether it will have time to substantially outline its views on the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill before the conclusion of business. We would like to be given time to do so and are asking that the sitting hours be extended even further. We are, therefore, objecting to the early conclusion of business at 10 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We will also be opposing the late sitting on the basis that there will be no opportunity to debate the Revised Estimates which have been returned from committee and to which the Tánaiste referred. I refer specifically to the Revised Estimate on Health. There is a woman in the Mater Hospital who requires cancer treatment&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Independent Insurance Group is going into liquidation, causing <Col N="457" /> a loss of jobs in Dublin. It means that certain companies cannot be insured for the second half of the year. More importantly, companies that were insured, particularly for employer's liability insurance, have no protection for claims against them pending in the courts. A number of significant Irish companies in the construction industry may go down if a large award is made against them. What does the Minister, Deputy Harney, who is responsible for the insurance industry intend to do about this problem? Can she give a commitment to the House that companies in Ireland will not be disadvantaged to a greater extent than those in the United Kingdom, where the Policyholders Protection Board is underpinning the risk? I am sure the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been briefed by her office. One big successful claim in the High Court will be a serious issue for huge construction companies and for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is responsible for the insurance industry, has not already announced how it proposes to address the market failure. The Department should ensure that companies that have taken out insurance to cover potential liability can be covered to avoid the meltdown that would affect many Irish companies if they were sued without proper cover. Is the Tánaiste capable of moving with the same speed as one of her predecessors, the late Frank Cluskey when the PMPA collapsed? That is what is needed if the Government is to provide certainty in the marketplace for the business sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the consequences of the closure of Independent Insurance, which, as Deputy Noonan said, is a UK company. Under EU directives any insurance company licensed or authorised in one member state can practise throughout the Union and, therefore, the Irish regulatory authorities have no supervisory role in regard to this insurance company. As Deputy Noonan also said, the United Kingdom has consumer protection policies. My Department has been in touch with the UK authorities and the European Commission because it is not acceptable that any country can exclude the consumers of another from policy protection.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue generally, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, has met representatives of the insurance industry who have agreed to provide cover for companies which now find themselves without insurance. I urge companies to take that offer on board. However, taxpayers cannot bail out companies which go to the wall. Nobody would find that acceptable.</P>
      <P>There is a surplus of £18 million in the insurance fund established to rescue the PMPA. My Department is examining the legalities of what might happen to that money.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Cover cannot be provided for everybody but there will be hardship cases involving individuals who may have suffered personal injuries and who will not be able to get any compensation. Everybody wants a sympathetic solution, within reason, to that issue. Deputy Treacy will meet the insurance industry representatives again tomorrow to discuss the issues that have arisen. However, I am aware of the consequences of the collapse. Within the European Union a company is licensed to practise anywhere once it is authorised by one member state. However, some member states do not supervise such insurance companies and, therefore, there must be European-wide protection to address such a situation for consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very weak reply on a serious issue. The Tánaiste does not seem to be on top of this. She made three points. The first is that she believes the UK Policyholders Protection Board should be compelled by the European Union to protect consumers in Ireland. That is a ridiculous position. If the UK Government has a board in place to protect consumers, surely it is the responsibility of the Irish Government to have a board in place to protect Irish consumers.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste addressed two of the issues but not the principal issue, which is that there are companies which were insured by Independent Insurance which are no longer insured and claims are pending against them. These claims could be settled for significant amounts and the Irish companies have no protection because they have no insurance. While steps are being taken to get Irish companies to take out the insurance of the companies involved at extravagant premia, they will not cover outstanding claims. The issue of outstanding claims could be devastating.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste confirm that the company constructing Luas is one of the companies involved and that an outstanding claim against it could stop Luas in its tracks, if that is not a mixed metaphor for something we have been awaiting for the past four years?</P>

      <P>Earlier this month during Leaders' questions on the Order of Business, I raised with the Taoiseach the possibility of the State making Clancy Barracks available to Dublin Corporation at a price to address the backlog of 7,100 families on the corporation's housing list. This was not accepted by the Government, which insisted, following the demands of the Minister for Finance, on the Department of Defence realising the value of a number of properties, including Clancy Barracks, to fund its own re-equipment programme.</P>
      <P>The sale of the barracks by public tender was deemed not to be a success in that the reserve price of approximately £20 million was not met by the market, although Dublin Corporation made a substantial offer for the property. Given that there are 7,100 families on the list and this 13.7 acre site could, subject to the preservation order on some of the buildings on it, provide accommodation for 300 families, will the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance and Defence examine how this housing need, which will never be met by the market forces so much beloved by the Tánaiste, could be in some way addressed? Dublin Corporation this year, through buy backs and new additions in an area where it can virtually acquire no land to build new housing, will provide approximately 800 new dwellings. If this property was given to the corporation at a price &ndash; I am not looking for it be given for free although that would be welcome &ndash; its housing supply for local authority and social and affordable housing could possibly be increased by 50%. We are seeking mixed housing, not a single local authority ghetto, which it would become otherwise. It is in the hands of the Government. The market has not met the reserve price set for the site by the Department of Finance and the Government could do something about it.</P>

Is she also embarrassed that, while there is an amount of State land in Dublin owned by Departments and semi-State organisations, when any of it is disposed of, it is offered to other Departments but never to Dublin Corporation for housing purposes? Is it not time a register of all State property in Dublin, which is no longer needed, was put together and first offers given to <Col N="460" /> Dublin Corporation to make a serious attempt to resolve the housing crisis and house young people in the city?</P>

I ask the Tánaiste, as the acting head of Government as long as the Taoiseach is out of the country, to ask the Ministers for Finance, Defence and Environment and Local Government, about the ceiling put on how much Dublin Corporation can bid for the property which has prevented it bidding up to the reserve demanded by the Department of Finance and set by its advisers.

In the context of the all-party view at the committee yesterday, will the Government bring before the House next week a brief Bill comprising section 7 of the Human Rights Commission Bill to allow for the formal establishment of the Human Rights Commission in law and the broadening of its membership and allow it to start fulfilling its statutory functions? Will the Government agree to postpone Committee, Report and Final Stages of this Bill until the early autumn to facilitate the committee to hold the proper hearings which must now take place on the provisions of this Bill, to afford the Minister reasonable time to consider amendments he may wish to bring forward and to afford the same time to the Opposition? </P>
      <P>I am sure the Tánaiste would appreciate the seriousness of the position if the president or chairman of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission made a submission to a parliamentary committee expressing serious reservations about a Bill before the Assembly in Northern Ireland. We would take a poor view if the reservations expressed were entirely ignored by members of the Assembly. We should be cautious in ignoring the views expressed by Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, the president of our Commission on Human Rights, at the committee yesterday.

The Government has abandoned people with disabilities because it keeps pushing out this proposal. It now proposes to introduce such a Bill at the end of this year. Now that it has legislation which is well drafted, will the Government consider the human rights of people with disabilities and publish a disabilities Bill earlier than was promised so we can finally fulfil promises made to people with disabilities? </P>

      <P>It was a disgraceful decision and in future my attitude would be to withdraw from proceedings that make a mockery of normal business. However, I will try to deal with as many amendments as possible in the few short minutes remaining.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&ndash;Regard shall be had in the interpretation of this Act to the instruments mentioned in the long title to this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is purely a technical amendment. I want to have certainty in the written text of the Act to ensure that the courts would have regard to the two conventions mentioned in the Long Title, that is, the convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions and the criminal law convention in the interpretation of the provisions of the Bill. If the response from the Minister is that this will be done in any event, it is important that it would be explicitly stated in the Act proper and, rather than labour the point, I hope this modest amendment can be accepted so that we can get on to the more substantive amendments that lie ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. I repeat what I said on a number of occasions on Committee Stage. This amendment, and the other amendments in the name of Deputy Howlin, represent an attempt to supplant the provisions of the Bill with provisions which the Deputy suggests would lead to the enactment of a consolidated anti-corruption Act. I have made the point on a number of occasions that consolidation is not as simple as that and the Deputy's amendments, if accepted, would result in less <Col N="477" /> effective anti-corruption laws than we have at present. I reiterate that the corruption Acts will be the subject of early restatement under the Statute Law Restatement Bill when passed.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the Bill before the House will enable Ireland to ratify a number of important international conventions. Broadly speaking, these conventions require us to provide that certain types of activities will be offences under our laws, that they will apply to domestic as well as foreign office holders and officials, that Irish nationals will be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts even for offences committed by them abroad, and that the Irish courts will also have jurisdiction where an offence occurs partly in the State and partly abroad. The Bill contains provisions to give effect to these in domestic law and will enable our ratification of all three conventions.</P>
      <P>Offences of active and passive corruption are set out in section 2(1) and (2). The categories of officials who may commit these offences are specified in section 2(5). Corruption occurring partially in the State, or wholly outside the State involving Irish officials, and corporate liability are contained in sections 6, 7 and 9, respectively. It is important that I point out again that we are not incorporating the conventions into Irish law and, therefore, it is not necessary to provide that the courts shall have regard to them in interpreting provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill, taken with the earlier Prevention of Corruption Acts, contains definitions of important words and phrases used in the Acts or in the Bill. These definitions are supplemented where necessary or appropriate by the Interpretation Acts. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dissatisfied with the Minister's response. I would like to have more time to tease out what we are doing regarding international conventions as it seems from recent experience that we sign up to them, but then in terms of domestic law, treat them with as minimalist an approach as possible. We have signed up to the two conventions listed in the long title. These are important conventions in terms of combating bribery and corruption. Although we are not transposing these conventions into Irish law, we have signed up to them and it is important that the courts should be obliged to have regard to them in interpreting the provisions of this enactment. That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the issue of consolidation in the next amendment. However, this amendment is not part of my argument regarding consolidation, but of my argument that these are important conventions which have been entered into by agreement of this House and successive Governments. In one case that was as far back as 1997. It is important that we do not just pay lip-service to international agreements, but that we show some regard to them. My amendment would not have <Col N="478" /> the effect of transposing them into Irish law, but would provide that in the interpretation of the measures we are putting into Irish law, the courts would have regard to these conventions into which we freely entered.</P>
    <P>The Department's attitude may be that we can sign up to international conventions without domestic consequences. If that is the case, and it may be from our experience of the transposition of the European Convention of Human Rights, it would be a sad approach.</P>

    <P>This amendment sets the stage by proposing a number of new definitions in order that we would have an integrated prevention of corruption Bill rather than a more minimalist addition to the corpus of anti-corruption legislation which dates back to the 19th century.</P>
    <P>The original Act was the 1889 Act which applied only to bodies outside central government. This is an amending Bill which leaves on the Statute Book four other Acts dating back to 1889. The 1889 Act will remain on the Statute Book as will the 1906 Act which introduced a comprehensive measure dealing with corrupt transactions with an agent concerning the affairs or business of his principal. In 1916 a presumption of corruption payment was introduced to cover situations where it was proven that a payment was made by a person holding, or seeking to hold, a Government contract. The opportunity was taken in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, to update the language in all previous Acts.</P>
    <P>We now have legislation dating from 1889, 1906, 1916 and 1995, and a cross-referencing of these Acts. On Second Stage we discovered that there is some confusion as to how to read interpretations as we were amending amendments to previous legislation. It would not have been difficult for the Minister to introduce a comprehen<Col N="481" /> sive Bill. I would like to argue this case longer but I am conscious of time.</P>
    <P>The principle of having a consolidation Bill is important if we are serious about dealing with corruption. There should be no ambiguity, but there should be clarity. In response to a parliamentary question yesterday, the Taoiseach outlined to me that the use of plain language in law &ndash; a principle enunciated by the Law Reform Commission &ndash; is to be accepted by Government. Part of plain language in law is simplicity of reading enactments. Parliamentarians find it difficult to read legislation when they are cross-referencing legislation which goes back more than a century. It should be possible to introduce a consolidating measure.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister promised that consolidation will be revisited. As he will not be impressed by the force of my arguments, perhaps he will give the House a specific time when this area of legislation, which is not particularly complicated, will be consolidated into a single legislative measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the purpose and intention of this amendment, it replicates in large measure provisions already contained in the Bill. Amendment No. 2 sets out the meaning of certain words and phrases, some of which are standard in legislation. However, I wish to concentrate on aspects of the meaning given to the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; which must be read together with the meaning given to the phrase &ldquo;public official&rdquo; in the amendment. These largely mirror the meaning given to the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in the Bill, including domestic and foreign officials, members of domestic and foreign Governments and Parliaments, domestic and foreign judges and members of certain EU bodies.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the amendment continues to use the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; despite the Deputy's previous comments about the use of outdated language in the Bill. There are, however, some differences between the amendment and section 2 of the Bill. Most notable of these is the inclusion of the President in the amendment. The question of including the President as an office holder to whom the provisions of the Bill, or of other amendments, will apply impinges on the constitutional position of the President.</P>
      <P>Article 13.8.1º of the Constitution provides as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas or to any court <Col N="482" /> for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has advised that it is clear from this Article that the only liability which the President could have in law is for an act done by the person of the President declaring himself or herself to be doing it in a private capacity where the act is in no way connected with the exercise or performance of the powers and functions of the office.</P>
    <P>Whatever liability might be placed on the person of the President, therefore, cannot be connected with the President as a public official. Accordingly it would not be possible to include the President as a public official to be covered by the Bill. As a result of this, and the fact that section 2 adequately deals with the matters covered by the amendment, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not accepted the consolidation argument which is the real intent of what I am seeking to achieve. However, I will withdraw the amendment to allow another amendment to be moved before we conclude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a legal mechanism to bring the current waste management planning process to an early and satisfactory conclusion. This is essential for us to meet our national and EU obligations.</P>
      <P>The waste planning process has been taken forward systematically since the enactment of the Waste Management Act, 1996, and while local authorities generally have sought to address their responsibilities in this area, a minority have not adopted plans. As a result, we have not made the progress that we all accept is vitally necessary and long overdue towards the provision of efficient and cost effective waste services and infrastructure. Our waste arisings continue to grow at a conservatively estimated rate of 3% to 4% each year. At the same time, there is an increasing scarcity of disposal options as landfill facilities throughout the country are being closed on reaching the end of their life span.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to act to tackle these difficulties. Continued debate is not an option as we have already lost very extensive time. The legislative measures proposed by the Government will ensure the early completion of the planning process and <Col N="485" /> rapid movement towards the implementation of proposed waste management plans.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward amending legislation, the Government is taking the opportunity of providing a statutory basis for a number of other important waste management and anti-litter measures, including the following: a new environmental levy of up to 15p on the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags and, potentially the extension of the levy to other products that are problematic in waste management terms; a levy on the landfill of waste at an initial rate of not more than £15 per tonne; the establishment of an environment fund through which the proceeds of these levies will be disbursed to finance beneficial environmental initiatives in a range of areas, including waste management, environmental education and awareness; an increase of the on-the-spot litter fine to £100 and provision for future changes in the level of the fine and a number of technical amendments to the Waste Management Act, 1996, to bring legal clarity to the licensing, by the Environmental Protection Agency, of certain waste related activities.</P>
    <P>Strategic planning is fundamental to good waste management. The failure, until relatively recently, to develop comprehensive and modern strategies in this area has left us with an unenviable legacy. We landfill about 90% of our municipal waste, often in small, inadequate landfill facilities. We have a limited recycling infrastructure, almost no biological treatment capability and no means of recovering energy from waste. Our waste recycling rate is among the lowest in the EU and that is simply not sustainable. The Government is committed to a planned and integrated approach to waste management based firmly on the internationally recognised hierarchy. The proposed plans focus firstly on prevention and minimisation and place high emphasis on waste segregation, reuse and recovery. They advocate a range of technologies to deliver a more sustainable and effective recycling and recovery performance and significantly reduce our reliance on landfill. My Department and I strongly support a regional approach to the making and implementation of the necessary waste management plans. The great majority of local authorities are committed to the making of joint or regional plans in line with our policy statement of October 1998 entitled <i>Changing Our Ways</i>. Considerable financial and human resources, including EU grant assistance towards dedicated strategic studies, have been allocated to this process, which entailed significant public consultation throughout.</P>
    <P>However, we have encountered ongoing problems and delays in the formal adoption of regional plans. Three out of 15 local authorities, in three regional groups, have refused to adopt the proposed regional plan before them. In effect, these authorities are obstructing any prospect of progress on the part of the majority and they have severely impeded the overall planning process. Even in the two regions where all the local <Col N="486" /> authorities concerned decided to adopt their regional plan, some did so subject to potentially significant qualifications. My Department has received clear legal advice on the issue. A proposed regional waste management plan must be adopted on the same substantive basis by all the authorities concerned or none can be considered to have a valid plan. We cannot allow the current drift to continue. We have to meet national and EU targets for waste recovery and the diversion of wastes from landfill. More immediately, we see pressing waste management problems on the ground, in Clare and Galway for example, and the European Commission has taken a case against Ireland to the European Court of Justice because of the ongoing failure to respect waste planning obligations. A judgment against Ireland may be unavoidable, particularly if authorities persist in their refusal to adopt the balanced and comprehensive plans before them.</P>
    <P>The Government must act in the overall national interest and take steps to facilitate the satisfactory completion of the planning process. That is the basis for addressing all aspects of the waste hierarchy and advancing the provision of a vital element of our infrastructure. The legal options have been considered and we have concluded that the existing regulatory powers under the 1996 Act are not enough to ensure a decisive and satisfactory outcome. Accordingly, the Government has decided the power to make the waste management plans &ndash; now before local authorities &ndash; should be transferred from the elected members to the relevant manager. The Government also proposes to make other supporting legislative amendments. This will allow local authority management to conclude the planning process and remove any perceived obstacles to the effective implementation of regional plans. I emphasise that this will clear the way to deliver on all aspects of waste modernisation such as segregated collection services, higher recycling and recovery performance, and a dramatic reduction in disposal to landfill.</P>
    <P>Last April when the Bill was debated in the Seanad much of the debate focused on two issues. Those were the implications of these proposals for the local decision making process and concern regarding thermal treatment, which is an integral part of most of the proposed regional plans. I do not accept that these proposals undermine the local government process. A small number of local authorities clearly have difficulty in addressing their waste planning obligations and Government is compelled to respond. The proposed changes will not affect the substance of the waste management plans adopted by the majority of local authorities. It is clearly undemocratic that a few authorities can hold up the implementation of important regional plans and, far from eroding local democracy, the proposed Bill will allow the wishes of the majority of local authorities to be implemented. It is telling that, to date, there have been no practical alternatives offered to these proposals. Indeed, the thrust of public commen<Col N="487" /> tary has been to recognise the inevitability and urgency of these proposals.</P>
    <P>The second point of contention involved thermal treatment. The proposed regional waste management plans are not just, or even mainly, about thermal treatment. They are concerned with better integrated waste management services for the regions, delivering a much higher recycling performance, recovering energy from waste which cannot be recycled and using landfill as the last resort for residual wastes which cannot otherwise be treated. Thermal treatment, whether by incineration or other technologies, is envisaged as only one component of an integrated infrastructure which will facilitate recycling and biological treatment of 40% to 50% of waste. Opposition to thermal treatment proposals centres on perceived risks to public health and a perceived conflict between incineration and materials recycling. However, there is an informed consensus that modern municipal waste incinerators, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, do not present a significant risk to the environment or public health. All significant waste facilities are subject to full environmental impact assessment, planning controls and a rigorous environmental licensing system operated by the EPA which must take the precautionary principle into account.</P>
    <P>The EPA is specifically and legally precluded from licensing a waste facility unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not cause environmental pollution. The agency, which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions, considers municipal waste incineration, operating to the best modern standards and incorporating energy recovery, to be preferable to landfill from an environmental point of view. While it is now common to decry the advice of experts, rational decision making requires that we, as decision makers, take expert views into account. However, we must also address a wider public demand for good information and assurance. I accept there are many people who have real and genuine concerns about perceived health threats from thermal treatment or incineration. These concerns arise in no small measure from misinformation and misrepresentation. We clearly face a challenge in countering negative public perceptions and the need to disseminate reasoned, well founded information and advice to the public will be addressed in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Incineration and high recycling levels are not mutually exclusive. I accept they could be if incineration were prioritised and insufficient effort was put into composting and materials recycling. However, the regional plans clearly do the reverse. They first provide for maximum achievable recycling, with targets of up to 50%, and only then do they give consideration to thermal treatment and landfill of the remaining waste. Under these plans, the proportion of waste which may be disposed of by proposed thermal treat<Col N="488" /> ment is deliberately limited. Argument that the provision of thermal treatment means incinerators would have to be fed, thereby reducing efforts to recycle, are not valid. We are committed to and must meet specific EU and national recycling targets. Throughout the EU the most environmentally progressive member states combine an impressive recycling performance with a significant reliance on thermal treatment as part of an integrated approach to waste management. Unfortunately, the focus of debate on incineration detracts from the very positive minimisation and recycling elements of the proposed plans. Local authorities in the regional groups are being asked to prioritise those elements of the plans dealing with waste minimisation, the delivery of segregated collection services and waste recycling infrastructure, public education and awareness and to prepare a clear programme of action to fast track the implementation of these aspects of the plans.</P>
    <P>To support these initiatives the Government intends to publish a comprehensive policy statement on waste prevention, recycling and recovery. That will address in detail practical considerations associated with the achievement of our policy objectives and targets in this area and will outline specific proposals in relation to waste prevention, market development for recyclables and the provision of greater infrastructural and reprocessing capacity.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the substantive provisions of the Bill. Section 4 amends section 22 of the 1996 Act to provide that the making of a waste management plan will become an executive function. Where a local authority manager considers that a waste management plan is invalid because the purported decision of the relevant authority was subject to qualification, the manager will adopt the said plan. The variation or replacement of a waste management plan will generally remain a reserved function, but a local authority may not, without the consent of the relevant manager, vary or replace a plan within a period of four years of its being made. This is to ensure a period of stability during which local authorities can focus on the implementation of plans.</P>

      <P>A local authority will be precluded from making resolutions under sections 3 or 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, or section 179 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, that would be contrary to, or inconsistent with, any provision of a waste management plan or would limit or restrict the proper implementation of such plans. Section 5 provides for a consequential amendment of the definition of waste management plan in section 22(1) of the 1996 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 provides for a technical amendment of section 38(5) of the 1996 Act, to remove a perceived legal impediment and allow for the intensification of use of an existing waste facility oper<Col N="489" /> ated by an urban district council. The 1996 Act currently empowers only county councils and city corporations to develop waste disposal facilities. However, a unique and problematic situation has arisen in Galway, where the only available landfill is operated by Ballinasloe UDC.</P>
    <P>As this section now stands, the EPA is precluded from granting a waste licence authorising the expansion of this facility to receive waste inputs of the level required in the period to 2005, at which time the landfill will close and be replaced by a new facility within the regional framework. At current intake levels this landfill will reach its authorised capacity next year with no prospect of replacement in that timescale. Accordingly, this provision is a short-term measure to allow the necessary intensification of use of this facility where so provided for in the relevant regional plan.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the amendment of section 39 of the 1996 Act to allow for a prohibition or limitation of the recovery or disposal of a specified class of waste in specified waste facilities. This is an enabling provision that will facilitate transposition of certain aspects of the EU landfill directive which require certain wastes, such as tyres and liquids, to be prohibited from landfills but may also facilitate measures to support recycling.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the insertion of a new section 72 in the 1996 Act providing for the imposition of an environmental levy of not more than 15p or 19 cents in respect of the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags; the subsequent increase of this amount to be in accordance with increases in the consumer price index, the possible extension by provisional order of an environmental levy to other products or articles, such order requiring to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas before it has effect, and related regulatory powers, including power to require that the net proceeds of the levy be paid into the environment fund.</P>
    <P>Plastic bags are a visible and persistent component of litter pollution in urban, rural and coastal settings. They impact on ecosystems and on habitats and wildlife and they undermine Ireland's clean green image. It is conservatively estimated that approximately 1.2 billion plastic shopping bags are provided free of charge to consumers at retail outlets annually. This equates to roughly 325 plastic bags per head of population per year, which is excessive and largely unnecessary. The primary purpose of the proposed measure is to directly influence consumer behaviour and to achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of plastic shopping bags dispensed at retail outlets. The levy will be imposed as a point of sale levy on the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags to customers. It is intended under the proposed regulations that retailers will be required to pass on the full amount of the levy as a charge to customers at the checkout. The responsibility for collecting the levy will rest with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> Section 9 provides for a consequential technical amendment to section 7 of the 1996 Act in relation to provisional orders made under section 72(12).</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the insertion of a new section, section 73, in the 1996 Act to allow for the imposition of a levy on the landfill of waste at an initial rate of not more than £15 per tonne or 19 per tonne from 1 January 2002, the subsequent increase of this amount by not more than 5 per tonne annually and related regulatory powers, including powers to require that the proceeds of the levy be paid into the environment fund. The levy will be payable by the person who carries on the waste activity concerned, in most cases local authorities, and regulations made under the section will give local authorities powers to collect the levy from any private operator in whose functional area the waste disposal activity is carried on. Historically, the relatively low cost of landfill in Ireland has contributed to an undue reliance on this option and has militated against other more desirable waste recovery options. The intention of a landfill levy is to encourage the diversion of waste away from landfill and generate revenues for the new environment fund that can be applied in support of waste minimisation and recycling initiatives.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the insertion of a new section 74 in the 1996 Act providing for the establishment of an environment fund to be managed and controlled by the Minister and to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Minister may pay money from the fund for a range of measures, including programmes to prevent or reduce waste, the establishment and operation of waste recovery activities, litter prevention, producer responsibility initiatives, environmental partnership projects and environmental awareness, education and training.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the amendment of the First Schedule to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and section 39 of the 1996 Act to provide legal clarity and remove a potential duplication of licensing requirements for certain waste recovery and disposal facilities. A dual licence covering the requirements of both regimes, or two separate but similar licences, would lack the necessary clarity and enforceability. Accordingly the section provides that waste recovery and disposal facilities will be licensable by the Environmental Protection Agency under the 1996 Act, except where the facilities are connected or associated with an activity which is or will be licensed by the agency under the 1992 Act. Section 13 provides for amendments to the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, in relation to on-the-spot fines for litter offences. The section provides for an increase of the fine to £100 or 125 from a future date to be set by ministerial order. Further increases in the fine in the future are not to exceed 25% in any three year period. The section also confirms the Litter Pollution Regulations, 1999, which had increased the fine to £50.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> The Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, when enacted, will provide a legal mechanism to satisfactorily conclude the stalled waste management planning process. It will facilitate the delivery of improved waste services and the development of an effective and safe waste infrastructure. The Bill will also provide for a range of environmentally important and desirable initiatives to be undertaken in the near future. I look forward to the debate on the Bill which I hope will range across its many full important provisions. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Section 4 is the most contentious part of this Bill. We will be opposing it because it takes away powers from elected members, the representatives of the people, and gives those powers to unelected managers who are not accountable and under no obligation to meet local communities. This is a hamfisted measure which seeks to force policy through. It is an inadequate way to proceed and we will oppose it.</P>
      <P>However, I welcome the opportunity this Bill gives us to debate the waste management issue and our difficulties in developing real, efficient and workable waste management systems, though we have policies, wonderful statements, targets, proposals and suggestions. We have examined waste management in detail in other countries and the Minister of State has visited other States to find out how waste management can be carried out effectively. Councillors and Deputies have travelled abroad to see how successful waste management can be achieved. The Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government is to travel to Nova Scotia next month to view their successful structures. It is a country similar to our own and had little recycling originally. There was opposition to landfill and incineration yet they have managed to turn matters around in a short space of time. Nova Scotia has a similar population to Ireland. I am encouraged that it is possible to achieve recycling targets, both those that we have set for ourselves and European targets, and it is also possible to effectively manage our waste problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 proposes that the making of waste management plans become an Executive function. This measure is anti-democratic. It is another nail in the coffin for local democracy following the revolutions last week concerning the Local Government Bill, 2000. The managers of local authorities will now have the power to make a plan to manage waste without consulting the members. These are un-elected and unaccountable officials who are not obliged to meet the public for whom they are supposed to work. How <Col N="492" /> can they know the views of the people if they do not consult them?</P>
    <P>This measure will further alienate communities from their elected representatives. By introducing this measure the Minister has made a mockery of local elected representatives and their position. He has insulted them in front of the communities they represent. The Minister has criticised local representatives for not showing leadership and for failing to implement waste management plans. I disagree. Most local representatives reflect the huge concerns of the public, concerns that are not addressed by the Minister and his Department. The Minister has said that he will face the challenge in the coming months and that the concerns of the public will be addressed. It is a little late for that. We have had draft waste management plans for a number of years. To address the concerns of the public at this late stage is to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>The history of waste management facilities in Ireland leaves much to be desired. Traditional dumps have given local authorities a bad name and have created huge environmental problems. Everything was discarded into them. With hindsight and with increased knowledge, European environmental laws can be seen to be a great improvement. We know the risk to ground waters of dumping in unlined sites. We understand the need to collect and treat leachate. We are forced to cover landfills suitably on a daily basis to reduce emissions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we did not know in the past what we know now, and local authorities have lost the trust of the public. Local authorities blotted their copy-books in many cases and have lost respect. We are reaping the harvest of that in many areas as we face the public with new proposals for waste facilities, be they transfer sites, sorting facilities, landfill sites or incinerators. The public do not have confidence in the authorities to safely manage these facilities.</P>
    <P>This Bill is termed an Act to amend the Waste Management Act, 1996, and to amend the Act with regard to the procedure for the making of waste management plans under it so that any obstacles to the State may be removed. The obstacles that the Minister refers to in the Bill are local authority members and local people in areas where waste management facilities are to be located. This is arrogant and insulting, and I object to the use of the word &ldquo;obstacles&rdquo; in the Bill. The Minister wants to railroad through reports prepared by consultants who may have no affinity with the area or the communities involved.</P>
    <P>The communities are the obstacles in the Minister's path. He produces legislation to eliminate the obstacles. Why not talk to the communities involved, listen to them and focus on their concerns? Documents such as &ldquo;Changing Our Ways&rdquo; are excellent and desirable but their message is not heard by the people on the ground. There are three plans which have not yet been ratified by local authorities. The main stumbling blocks to <Col N="493" /> these plans concern incineration. That is widely acknowledged. The main objections are based on health fears and the concern that incinerators will have to be constantly fed and will do little or nothing to encourage recycling of waste products.</P>
    <P>We need a health study on the risks of incineration. I am aware of recent EU directives which reduce emission levels for dioxins. This means that future facilities will have lower emission rates than existing plants in Europe. However, the word &ldquo;dioxin&rdquo; instils fear in people, and rightly so. There is much information in this area and I am disturbed that various experts on both sides of the argument have addressed gatherings on the subject. I am always suspicious and cautious when taking advice from so-called experts. One can always wheel out an expert to support one's argument.</P>
    <P>What is needed is independent expert advice by a recognised profession established under the aegis of the health research board. Incineration should not be considered or tolerated until we address all issues relating to waste minimisation, reduction of waste, re-using and recycling. Let us achieve realistic and effective targets in this area before seeing what balance remains. Do we need five thermal treatment plants? Will we have the volume of waste to support them? When we address these questions we will see the wood for the trees and will have raised serious questions about the viability of a number of these facilities.</P>
    <P>There are seven regional waste plans that have been produced by three different consultants who were told the parameters within which to work. Not all of these plans include incineration. I am familiar with the Cork area which did not include recommendations for a thermal treatment plant in its plan. When I questioned the county engineer at a regional waste meeting, I was informed that such a facility was not economically viable. I accept this but ask why it is viable in some regions with a low population and not in others with a higher population. This requires serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The Cork plan is not being adopted for legitimate reasons. The local authority requested the production of a waste management plan but the proposals they received referred to a particular location for a facility. This is unacceptable to a majority of the council. It is one thing to prepare a general plan but quite another to suggest specific locations. That is a function of the elected members. The plan would be approved tomorrow if the reference to that particular location were removed. However, I suspect that the county manager is waiting for this Bill to be passed to that he can go ahead in accordance with his own views on the matter.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with groups throughout the country, a key point made to me is that little consideration is given to recycling. The only proposals which are considered in waste management plans &ndash; although I accept that there are others &ndash; are for landfill or incineration. I am asked what happens between the production of <Col N="494" /> the waste and its disposal. Many people travel abroad and see how the Germans and Dutch separate their waste and present it for collection. They want to know the reason the same cannot be done here and the answer is that there is nothing to prevent us from following the example set in these countries.</P>
    <P>We must involve citizens in the recycling process by educating them and allowing them to play a part. Waste is a valuable resource, not something we should merely throw away. I am encouraged by what Dublin Corporation is trying to do and congratulate it on its proposals to introduce separate collection facilities. I know it will manage its new waste collection facilities in an efficient manner, but what will happen to the collected products? Are such products really recycled? Of course not, because we do not have the necessary infrastructure to allow us to recycle. The reality is that most packaging is either exported or dumped on landfill sites. Are we fooling members of the public by encouraging them to separate their waste, when such waste is not then recycled? The current system is merely a sham.</P>
    <P>Bottle banks and repositories for aluminium cans are the only effective recycling initiatives in place, because it is easy to recycle glass and aluminium. However, there is a company which recycles plastics which is obliged to import plastic bottles because there is no method by which these can be collected. Why is there not a paper recycling mill in Ireland? If we can justify the need for five incinerators, surely we can also justify the need for such a mill? The sad truth is that we lack the necessary infrastructure. In addition, there is a need to encourage and develop the marketing of recyclable products.</P>
    <P>This matter must be addressed on a national basis and not by local authorities, because the latter will promote local issues and concerns. I accept that they can organise separate collections, but the necessary manufacturing facilities must be provided, aided and supported on a national basis. The requisite markets must also be dealt with in this way. Progress will not be made if this matter is left in the hands of county managers or local authorities.</P>
    <P>There has been a lack of progress in terms of the advancement of recycling of waste products in Ireland because the Minister is content to leave the matter to local authorities in the hope the system will fall into place. That has not happened. In the past four years our recycling rates have not increased. Ireland only recycles 3% of domestic waste and 9% of municipal waste and has one of the lowest recycling rates in Europe. There has been a great deal of discussion but a decided lack of action in respect of this matter. For example, nothing has been done about construction and demolition waste, one of the easiest products to recycle. The Minister has received the report of the construction forum in respect of this matter but it has not yet been published. We have been tardy in taking action in this area, in respect of <Col N="495" /> which only a low level of intervention and support would be required in order to allow progress to be made.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the imposition of a tax on the use of plastic bags. I welcome any measure designed to reduce the number of plastic bags we use. We should focus, however, not on the fact that these bags cause a litter problem but on the negative effect they have on the environment. Plastic bags have a long lifetime, millions have been dumped on landfill sites and the highly toxic chemicals they contain contaminate water sources.</P>
    <P>As stated, I would welcome any measure that would reduce the number of plastic bags of which we dispose and will be interested in teasing out on Committee Stage the details of how the Minister's proposal will work. For example, there are over 9,000 grocery outlets and 31,700 retail outlets throughout the country. Who will be responsible for collecting the tax from the owners of these outlets? I understand the Revenue has been charged with this duty, but will it have the necessary resources to allow it to do so? This procedure will be open to circumvention and it will be easy for retailers to import plastic bags from outside the State, sell them to customers at a cost of 15p and turn a tidy profit. There will be no record of such bags being purchased in the State. The procedures for collecting the proposed tax will be open to interference and I am concerned about the level of success we will enjoy in terms of imposing it.</P>
    <P>Will a tax be placed on every plastic bag? I refer to the smaller bags in supermarkets into which people place meat, fruit, vegetables, etc. There is a great deal of confusion among retailers &ndash; particularly the members of RGDATA &ndash; regarding how the tax will be imposed. I am sure its introduction will focus consumers' minds on reducing the amount of plastic products they use, but I am concerned about how it will be imposed and the moneys collected from it.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the proposed £15 levy for landfill collection. Most landfills are operated by local authorities, which are responsible for setting rates and service charges. It is obvious that this £15 charge will be passed on to waste producers &ndash; in many instances householders or ratepayers &ndash; and, therefore, local authorities will encounter difficulties in collecting this additional tax, which is to be collected locally and distributed nationally. The fact that they collect rates and service charges and will now be obliged to collect the proposed levy will lead to a conflict of interests and give rise to many difficulties.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the spending of the moneys in the environmental fund are interesting and I am sure we will discuss the matter further on Committee Stage. I am interested in discovering who will be the members of the committee to which the Minister of State referred and also who will be responsible for overseeing the spending of <Col N="496" /> the moneys collected under the levy. He indicated that the accounts will be audited each year, but I am interested in discussing the principle of how the fund will be spent and the areas on which such spending will be focused.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in on-the-spot litter fines to £100. I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, is extremely interested in this area. Anything that will stop people littering is a welcome advance. Will the Minister of State investigate the problem of streets not being cleaned at weekends? It makes no sense that street cleaners go off duty at 5 p.m. on a Friday evening and, in some areas, do not return until 9 a.m. the following Monday morning. I accept that members of the public treat the streets with contempt. On Saturday and Sunday mornings some of the streets in my area are littered with empty chip bags and Coke cans. Our streets are busy at night and we must ensure they are adequately cleansed at weekends when most littering occurs.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my opposition to section 4 of the Bill, the provisions of which represent a ham-fisted, narrow and blinkered approach to waste management. They will not help us to solve the problems which exist nationally.</P>

      <P>I understand the course was littered with people playing bad shots.</P>
      <P>We did not obtain the title of the &ldquo;dirty Irish&rdquo; for no reason. We are prone to litter and damage the environment because of indifference, ignorance or contempt for authority. The latter is the most likely reason for our behaviour. Littering of our streets and roadsides is disgraceful. After visiting another European Union member state, one is struck by the filth on arriving into Dublin or Cork Airport. It is an everyday occurrence although it is particularly bad at weekends. Local authority employees collect litter deposited by our citizens, some of them supposedly pillars of society. Well-heeled people throw half empty bags of chips or cigarette packages out of car windows. One would think that they are so well placed in society that they would be incapable of such deeds. Being litter bugs is endemic to our nation. Local authorities, such as that in County Waterford, employ litter wardens who prosecute those who deposit litter in illegal dumps. Having their names published in the local media has a sobering affect. Are Travellers, who create the greatest mess, ever prosecuted? Recently, it cost £60,000 to clean up a site they occupied in Dublin. We tolerate some groups littering and causing a nuisance while others are prosecuted. It should not be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> The issue of dumps, litter and waste disposal is so topical and emotional that if people knew that this debate was taking place, the Public Gallery would be packed.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a relevant point. People who are most concerned are entitled to listen to the debate. This is a democracy and they are entitled to be here like other groups. The Minister's statement that we landfill about 90% of municipal waste, often in small inadequate facilities, sums up much of the problem. Saying that we have limited recycling infrastructure is an understatement. We have almost no biological treatment capability and no means of recovering energy from waste. Our recycling rate is among the lowest in the EU. The Minister says this is not sustainable. Of course it is not. I repeatedly raised the necessity for recycling. The Minister ought to give an honest answer, not an evasive one which he invariably does. We must face up to the fact that we are not doing the job properly and that we have the problem of economy of scale in recycling. We must import certain plastic materials to make a recycling operation viable. Most of these operations are not viable because of the economy of scale. Britain, with 60 million people, Germany and France have the economy of scale. I advocate subsidising people who engage in recycling here because they cannot make a living out of it. The operation does not pay. People get tax breaks for getting rid of urban blight, such as replacing derelict buildings with blocks of flats, but no thought is given to getting rid of the blight of rubbish in the countryside and streets. People should be given an incentive to make a living out of recycling and so get rid of an awful nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every town and city has banks for bottles, plastics and metals. In my household, as with most, the biggest item of waste is newsprint. It is a disgrace that there are no facilities to recycle it. Politicians in general have an affinity for newspapers, wanting to see if their name occurs, and that may be why my household has so many. Bishop Lucey, <Col N="498" /> in the Minister's diocese, had a huge newsprint recycling effort, which he made pay. That is gone and people say that they do not want newsprint. We are not tackling the problem professionally.</P>
    <P>I have mixed feelings about the best way to dispose of material that cannot be recycled. The target is to recycle about 50%. We recycle about 3%, which may be optimistic, and that is why the European Commission is bringing us to the European Court of Justice. I am uncertain whether landfills or incineration is the solution. In Denmark incinerators operate in urban centres without any objection or problem. That might be the best solution. Landfills cause problems because everyone will be in a catchment area for some river or some stream leading into a river. Fear of pollution is reason most people protest. It is a real problem but this is a better solution than the smouldering dumps we have on the edge of every town and village, often on the banks of a river or at the back of a beach such as the one that was in Greystones for many years. We need to make up our minds which solution to accept. My solution is to recycle to the maximum degree and to try to attain the 50% figure. We should pay people to do it. We should subsidise them and get the builders' confederation to get rid of the solid materials. We must come up with a plan. It has been done in other countries. They get the solidified material and use it elsewhere in building and in backfills. We would then be left with a very small amount of rubbish and materials to get rid of and that should be our aim. Let us stop being at cross purposes. People should not have to protest and the Minister should stop acting the heavy by taking powers away from local representatives. Let us show a little imagination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party is opposed to the Second Stage of this Bill and we will call a vote on it tomorrow as the Government attempts to guillotine and prevent further debate on this important measure.</P>
      <P>It is four years ago to the day since this patchwork Government spent its first day in office. It was stitched together on the basis of a Programme for Government that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats entitled &ldquo;An Action Programme for the New Millennium&rdquo;. Page 21 of that document states: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government are committed to the restoration of real decision making and power to local authorities and local people&rdquo;. Further along the same page it states that &ldquo;key priorities will include removing the democratic deficit by restoring real power to the elected members&rdquo;. Here we are, four years later, debating a Bill which removes powers from the elected members and transfers them to the managers of local authorities, in effect increasing the democratic deficit at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page eight of the same document it states: &ldquo;Concern for the environment will be central to all policy decisions of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government. We believe <Col N="499" /> that the time has come to develop and implement an integrated environmental policy in partnership and consultation with local communities&rdquo;. It goes on to state: &ldquo;Key priorities will include implementing waste management policies which reflect the priorities of prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling and environmentally sustainable disposal&rdquo;. This Bill is designed to force through a waste management strategy in the face of opposition and concern from local communities. It has thrown the idea of environmentally sustainable disposal, whatever that meant, out the window. It is essentially based on incineration and flies in the face of the wishes of local communities.</P>
    <P>Given the embarrassing contradiction between the contents of the Bill and the Programme for Government it is tempting to point to the hypocrisy of the Government in introducing this measure. It is tempting to point to the gulf between the promise of the Programme for Government and the action being taken today and to excoriate Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats for their downright bad faith with the public on this measure. We can take Government hypocrisy as read.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Fianna Fáil Members and to the four Independents who support this Government to examine closely what is provided for in this Bill before lunch time tomorrow when they will be required to go through the lobby and support it. I ask them to exercise good authority and refuse to support it. Last week the four Independents who support the Government, and quite a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies, effectively changed Government policy on their continued membership of local authorities. I did not agree with the position taken last week but I understand it. I accept that the Independent Members and the Members of Fianna Fáil who were vocal in their parliamentary party last week were genuinely concerned with making a continued contribution to local democracy and local government. I say to them that they cannot insist on remaining a member of a local authority last week and this week come in and support a measure which takes away from those authorities and their elected members some of their most crucial powers.</P>
    <P>At lunch time tomorrow the Members of Fianna Fáil and the four Independents who were so prominent on the local government legislation last week will demonstrate whether their commitment to local democracy and local government is just skin deep, whether it is just about preserving their own continued membership of those local authorities or whether there is a genuine commitment to the concept of local government, local democracy and the democratic will of local communities.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Members of Fianna Fáil to the provisions in this Bill. Section 4 has already received a degree of publicity in that it proposes to remove from the elected members of local authorities the right to make waste management plans. That has been represented publicly <Col N="500" /> by some commentators, some of whom consider themselves to be a more advanced form of evolution than mere members of local authorities, as being necessary because some local authorities have not agreed to adopt waste management plans. That was repeated here by the Minister. They say it is a necessary measure because there are a few recalcitrant local authorities that will not buckle under and adopt the waste management plans.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes much further and I want Members of this House, particularly those who serve on local authorities, to examine this in greater detail. We are not just talking about the adoption of waste management plans or about those waste management plans which have already been made by local authorities but where local authorities, such as Roscommon County Council, have expressed qualifications in relation to the management plan adopted. The Bill states that if there is a qualification added to the adoption of the waste management plan the county manager can declare that plan invalid. The county manager does not have to go through any process in order to do that. He simply has to give it as his opinion. I do not make this up. The text of the legislation states &ldquo;as his opinion&rdquo;. In those circumstances the waste management plan is set aside and the county manager is given exclusive power to make a plan. It goes on to state in section 4(10)(<i>e</i>): &ldquo;A local authority shall not, without the consent of the manager of the authority, vary or replace, under section 4, a waste management plan&rdquo;. It removes from a local authority the powers elected members had under sections 3 and 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, that gives specific directions to the local authority. If this Bill is passed, members of local authorities will be expressly prohibited from giving a direction to their county manager on anything to do with a waste management facility, which includes not only incinerators but landfill dumps and other facilities.</P>
    <P>It gets worse, section 4(10)(<i>a</i>) states: &ldquo;The development plan for the time being in force in relation to the functional area of a local authority shall be deemed to include the objectives for the time being contained in the waste management plan in force in relation to that area.&rdquo;  The county manager is given the power to make the waste management plan which <i>ipso facto</i> is then deemed, under this Bill, to be automatically part of the county development plan. There is no consultation by the public and no decision by the elected members. The plan just appears. What does that mean? If it was not clear enough from that provision, the Bill goes on to spell it out. Where a planning application is made for a waste management facility, and where the manager considers that that planning application is in some way at variance with a city or county development plan, section 4(10)(<i>b</i>) sets out the procedure for making a material contravention to it. All of us who have served on local authorities are fam<Col N="501" /> iliar with that procedure. It is subject to public consultation and the elected members of the local authority make the decision to vary the development plan or grant planning permission that materially contravenes the plan. Under this Bill a planning application for a waste facility will not come back to the elected members of a local authority. The county manager will decide on the material contravention of the development plan and grant planning permission.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Fianna Fáil Members, particularly those who are members of local authorities and understand perfectly well what this means, and the Independent Members, who last week were so anxious to remain members of local authorities precisely in order that they could represent their communities on these matters, to consider carefully what this Bill means. We know that the Government intends that some facilities will be provided through pubilc-private partnerships and therefore planning applications will come from private companies. First, the initial proposal will come in the waste management plan &ndash; the county manager will now effectively decide what will be in it &ndash; under this Bill it will then be considered &ldquo;deemed to include the objectives&rdquo;. It will automatically be considered to be part of the county development plan. The normal planning process for waste facilities is being set aside in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House that this Bill has been authored by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. I am sorry he is not present in the House and have sent him my personal good wishes for his recovery. I recall that he is the same Minister who, in a previous portfolio, attempted to locate interpretative centres at Mullaghmore and Luggala without planning permission and had to be brought to heel in the Supreme Court. He now proposes that a waste facility can be built anywhere in the country and has effectively set aside the normal planning processes. That is what this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>It is profoundly undemocratic. It is suggested to us that it is being done in the interests of efficiency. The Minister of State's speech refers to the need for efficient and cost effective waste services and infrastructure. Every coup anywhere in the world has been justified on the grounds of efficiency. This is a coup against local democracy. Setting aside the powers of elected representatives at local level is as much an exercise of dictatorial anti-democratic politics as a military regime removing a parliament and its elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I resent the language used by the Minister of State in his contribution in saying &ldquo;it is now common to decry the advice of experts&rdquo;. He speaks in patronising terms about the people's concerns of health threats from terminal treatment or incineration and goes on to say &ldquo;these concerns arise, in no small measure, because of misinformation and misrepresentation&rdquo;. How utterly patronising and wrong. That is typical of the Government's arrogance, which resulted in the decision <Col N="502" /> on the Treaty of Nice referendum. It is as much as to say that the people are wrong. The people have every right &ndash; whether it is in County Louth, Ballinasloe, Newbridge, County Clare or any other area of the country &ndash; to express their concerns. Whether those concerns are about the health risks associated with incineration, pollution from a landfill dump or the traffic that will be generated in an area where a waste facility is provided, it is a fundamental democratic right to express those concerns. It is also fundamental to our democracy that they be enabled to have their elected representatives articulate and reflect those concerns in the decision making process. What is happening here is an attempt to drive a legislative bulldozer through these democratic rights.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the people are being told that they are wrong and have no right to air their concerns through their local representatives on any aspect of the planning for a waste facility. Is it any wonder that democracy in this country is in such a poor state? The Government should reflect on this. Because of the lack of consultation and the attempt to take short cuts, we have people in many areas who oppose the plans of the National Roads Authority. People in many areas oppose the waste plans foisted on them. We will go down a dangerous road by pursuing legislation in this manner, as democratic rights are being taken from the public.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agenda for the meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers that I attended on 15 June in Gothenburg consisted of a single item for discussion, namely the formal adoption of the 2001 broad economic policy guidelines following their <Col N="503" /> political endorsement by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council earlier that day. Ministers also had a brief discussion under Any Other Business on issues arising from current work at the OECD and on the future organisation of work on the question of population ageing. The outcome of the Nice referendum was not raised by me at the ECOFIN meeting, nor was it raised by other Ministers.</P>

      <P>As is usual at ECOFIN and Heads of State meetings which Finance Ministers normally attend, the press asks for briefings. I spoke to the press regarding matters relating to ECOFIN and European Council meetings and questions were also raised regarding the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum. My words and comments were reported adequately and well in all media.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is too kind to me in his suggestions. I was asked specific questions, which I answered. When I have been asked questions throughout my political life I have endeavoured to outline what I believe to be the situation as I see it and that is what I did on this occasion, as I have done for the past 20 odd years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being disingenuous. Does he agree he summoned the press with a view to sending a missile, whether it was aimed at the Taoiseach or the European Commission or both, and he cannot blithely walk away from the remarks as if they were casual, on-the-spot remarks? Were the remarks a targeted message aimed at the public, the Taoiseach and the European institutions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike many other Ministers and politicians, I spend much of my time refusing to give press briefings and conferences and I do not go out of my way to make comments to the press. However, as is normal, I was requested by the press to give a briefing. I was asked specific questions and I gave my assessment of the outcome of the Nice referendum. There was nothing in the replies which was in contradiction of Government policy. I was asked specific ques<Col N="504" /> tions about what I thought the outcome of the Nice referendum meant and I gave replies. I gladly ask anyone to point out anything in the replies which contradicts Government policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, given that he is a former Minister, it is not the practice of Ministers or Taoisigh to refer to discussions that are held on any occasion. The Taoiseach and I are in regular contact, as is the norm between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, on a wide variety of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the Taoiseach told him he was adding to disarray in the Government on the question of Europe? Does he accept the image of the Government over the past few weeks, to which he contributed substantially, has been one of it looking two ways on Europe and he has been perceived as a Eurosceptic? Is the Minister a Eurosceptic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that anything I said in Gothenburg was in contravention of Government policy. It is not the practice for Ministers to refer to discussions that they have with the Taoiseach or other colleagues on any matter. The Taoiseach said nothing to me over the past week or fortnight that he has not said on many previous occasions. Any references in the media to anything else are totally incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are not getting anywhere with that line of questioning, what did the Minister mean when he said the rejection of the Nice treaty was a remarkably healthy development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In a democracy such as Ireland's the people have the right to make decisions and Ireland was the only country in the EU where the question was put to the people rather than to their elected representatives. In spite of all the advice given by politicians, organisations and the bulk of the broadcast and print media, the people decided to reject the advice, similar to what happened in Denmark when the establishment there advised the people to vote a certain way not long ago. The only exception was one newspaper with a small readership. It is good to know in regard to the long-term interest of the country that the people, despite everybody leaning in one direction, can take an opposing view. I spend a good deal of time canvassing in my constituency during general election campaigns and I am continuously disappointed that 100% of the people in County Kildare do not vote for me and my party. Until the last general election we had not achieved anything near 100% of the vote. However, one accepts the democratic decision of the people. The people gave a message in the <Col N="505" /> Nice referendum and it behoves all of us to take it into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it was &ldquo;remarkably healthy&rdquo;. Would he consider it remarkably healthy if the people turned down the Nice treaty again? What should be the next step to get the people to adopt a different approach? He mentioned the Danish precedent. I am sure he is aware they got a protocol to the treaty at the time in order to put the referendum to the Danish people a second time. Does he believe the Government should seek some form of protocol to the Nice treaty before it is put to the people again? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I was referring to the last occasion on which the people of Denmark were asked to vote on a European issue, namely, whether they would join the euro. That was the last referendum held in Denmark and the people decided, against the wishes of all the political parties, to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to joining the euro.</P>
      <P>I did not say it was a healthy political development that the people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the specific issue of ratifying the Nice treaty. In line with all other members of the Government and with most Members of this House, I believe the Nice treaty should have been adopted by the people. However, we did not succeed in getting our message across. The people, in their wisdom, decided for whatever number of reasons &ndash; I am sure there are many &ndash; to reject that advice and to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;. One cannot be an <i>à la carte</i> democrat in Ireland. One either accepts the decision of the people or one does not. The Deputy and I have been through the same number of elections in this House and we have had to accept the decisions of the people on many occasions when our parties were not in Government. The sign of a healthy democracy is when people decide to exercise their vote. The most alarming aspect of the Nice referendum was the low percentage of the turnout. In time, people will look upon the decision of 7 June as a wake-up call. It has caused us some difficulties and will do so in the future, but it is a wake-up call for all the democratic Governments in Europe to realise that what they are possibly pursuing in a number of areas is not in line with the wishes of their people. That should be borne in mind by us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talks about accepting <i>à la carte</i> democracy. If he does not want to be an <i>à la carte</i> democrat, does he accept that the people's decision on the Nice treaty is final or does he believe there should be an attempt to reverse that democratic decision? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disingenuous of the Minister to say he celebrates the decision of the people without expecting them to infer that he also shares that opinion. He deliberately looked to create that confusion both among his colleagues in the European Council of Ministers and <Col N="506" /> at home. That is an indication of the petty populism with which he is closely identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spends his time as Opposition spokesperson decrying many of the things I have done. An independent assessment of my record over a 24 year period in this House will stand up better than most and it will show that I did not bow to petty populism. That is for other people to judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Minister doing it now? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not bowing to it now. I answered the specific questions put to me. Deputy McDowell, other Deputies and commentators believe it is sheep we send to Leinster House to mouth platitudes and to accept the popular flow. We all went along with the popular flow up to 7 June and the people then decided to reject our advice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked me a specific question. As I said after the Nice referendum, it is time for reflection and for the Government and all political parties in this House to take stock of the situation. The Government will eventually decide what to do. It is not unusual to put the question again to the people. As the Deputy is aware, the question of divorce was put to the people and he and I were on the same side. I was in a small minority in my party as I supported it on the first as well as the second occasion. It was roundly defeated on the first occasion. Following changes, some of which were for the better, and laws were brought into effect, the question was put again to the people after a number of years. I was still on the same side and it was passed by a small percentage. There is nothing unusual about putting the question to the people again. The Government should consider that in time and it will not be rushed into making a hasty decision.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the total yield to the Exchequer from stamp duty on residential properties in the first five months of 2001; the number of dwellings in this regard; and if he will give similar figures for the same period in 2000.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19109/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield from stamp duty on residential properties in the first five months of 2001 and the number of documents stamped in that regard is £79.89 million in respect of 8,320 documents stamped. The corresponding figures for 2000 are £93.01 million in respect of 13,915 documents stamped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures the Minister has given show an alarming decrease in stamp duty and a decrease in the number of houses being stamped. What accounts for that? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="507" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain why the reply refers to documents stamped and the Deputy's question asks about the number of dwellings in this regard. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that stamp duty data on residential property is collected and maintained by reference to the number of documents presented for stamping rather than the number of dwellings. However, the number of documents should, in general, correspond with the number of dwellings as only in exceptional cases would more than one document be presented for stamping on the transfer of residential property. The reply relates to documents stamped and the question relates to residential units, but there should not be much of a difference. I do not want to quibble over that.</P>
      <P>The main reason there was a drop in yield in the first five months is the increase in the exemption thresholds for second-hand houses in June last year. I increased the exemption threshold from £60,000 to £150,000 in the case of first time buyers of second-hand houses and from £60,000 to £100,000 for other owner occupiers. I also reduced the rates of stamp duty values in excess of these thresholds up to values of £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary admission. It is a dramatic collapse in stamp duty and houses completed. Does this tell the Minister that his policies have not only dramatically failed but that they are in urgent need of reversal? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The total yield from stamp duty, which covers not only residential units, has increased. The overall stamp duty yield has increased by over 20% compared to the corresponding figure last year. However, stamp duty as it relates to residential units is down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said in his second supplementary question that stamp duty in general was down. However, the total yield from stamp duty has increased. The reason for the drop in yield is the increase in the exemption limits which I applied to second-hand houses in June last year. For the first five months of last year the thresholds were lower. As a result, in the second Finance Act, 2000, which Deputy McGrath will remember, I increased the threshold limits for first time buyers of second-hand houses and for other owner occupiers from £60,000 to £100,000. I accept the point that when the number of documents stamped is compared with the number of dwellings the number of dwellings on which stamp duty is paid appears to be down. Stamp duty is not paid on new residential property where the purchaser is the owner occupier and the house is not greater than 125 square metres. That has been the case for a long number of years. Stamp duty does not apply generally to new residential property of owner occupiers. One would not necessarily be able to relate one to the <Col N="508" /> other. I accept the statement in a later Parliamentary Question that the number of housing starts appears to be less this year than in 2000 because evidence from the Department of the Environment and Local Government seems to indicate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter. This gives us a clear picture that the Minister's housing policies are a total failure and that there is a need for an urgent reversal of those policies. Will the Minister not accept that fact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be disingenuous about this. If the Deputy is making the separate allegation that the number of housing starts is down, I am willing to debate that with him. The figures will prove that they are down, but it would be incorrect to relate the yield from stamp duty and the number of documents stamped with the fall-off, if there is any, in the number of houses being produced. Stamp duty on houses mostly comes from second-hand houses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question relates to the failure of the Government's housing policy. Since we came to power we have endeavoured on a number of occasions, through some fiscal changes and other supply measures, to increase the supply of housing and it is true to say we have had some difficulty. We had two Finance Bills in 1998 and two in 2000, and the second Bill in each year related solely to the housing market. We are keeping the situation under review and it is about time we let the market settle down somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not time to let the market settle down at such a low level of output. Output is down at least 17% compared to this time last year. The Government has produced the first generation of young people who have no prospect of buying their own home. That is directly attributable to the Minister's policies.</P>

On the EU harmonised index of consumer prices, inflation stood at 4.1% in May down from 6% last November and 4.3% in April. The main contributors to the annual increase in prices in May were food and housing which combined to contribute 3.2% of the 5.4% increase in the consumer price index. In May, three other Eurozone member states had inflation rates higher than Ireland.</P>
      <P>At budget time, my Department forecast an average inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index of 4.5% this year. Other commentators, such as the ESRI and the Central Bank, have more recently forecast annual average inflation rates of 4.2% and 4.75% respectively in 2001.</P>
      <P>I still expect inflation to decline further over the second half of the year as the influence of external factors such as the oil price increase and the fall in the euro, which pushed up inflation last year, subsides. My Department will issue a revised inflation forecast with the publication of its economic review and outlook later this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all be vigilant in relation to the upward pressure on inflation from unfavourable <Col N="510" /> wage trends. Strict adherence to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is the best way to ensure wage developments do not discourage direct investment and endanger our competitiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank is talking about a possible 5% out-turn for this year. That is twice what the Minister found when he came into office four years ago. Will he agree that the high rate of inflation is directly attributable to his policies and that the European Union criticisms of his policies are now well founded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that my policies contributed to inflation. Most commentators would give the reasons for the increase in inflation in 2000 as factors totally outside of our control, excluding the tobacco price index which I initiated for good health policy reasons. The other determinants were the weak euro and the higher price of oil and oil-related products, which pushed up inflation in 2000. For the first few months of this year the main contributor to inflation was the unexpected rise in food prices which rose sharply as a result of foot and mouth disease. Food prices have risen by 7% in the 12 months to May. Food accounts for approximately 23% of the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>Ireland is no longer top of the league on the EU harmonised index of consumer prices. The last public figures show the EU harmonised index at 3.4%. Ireland is at 4.1%. That is not much consolation but the other countries, particularly Germany, are experiencing an upsurge in inflation for more or less the same reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year and a half before we joined the euro on 1 January 1999, the Deputy might remember that there were five Maastricht criteria which had to be met to satisfy the conditions. One of the most commonly known is that the rate of debt to GDP must be approaching 60%, but there was an inflation criterion also to the effect that we could not be more than 1.5% below the average of the three lowest countries. Ireland was actually the lowest of the three lowest countries and all other countries were measured against us. Therefore, if I want to take the credit for inflation between June 1997 to the end&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Eighteen months after I came into office the graph continued downwards, <Col N="511" /> but I did not claim credit for it then because I have long been of the view, in opposition as well as government, that the main determinants of inflation &ndash; Ireland being a small, open economy &ndash; are largely outside our control, and I have held to that position. As I explained, in the middle of the year we will publish our revised estimate on inflation. I pointed out in my reply that the ESRI reported recently and expected the average to be 4.2%. The Central Bank reported in recent days and stated the average might be 4.75%. We will publish our figures in the middle of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister denies, therefore, that there is any truth in the criticism by the European Union that his policies are expansionary and inflationary, and that he has nothing whatever to do with the doubling of the rate of inflation in the past three or four years. He inherited the lowest rate of inflation in the European Union when he became Minister and now we have one of the highest. Will he not accept even part of the responsibility for that? Will he not accept that his inflation policies, like his housing policies, are a disaster?</P>

      <P>I was directly responsible for one element of inflation in recent years, the 50p increase in a packet of 20 cigarettes I imposed in the budget of two years ago. That contributed about 0.8% to the headline CPI figure&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;for the following 12 months, but in the same way that I did not claim credit when it was coming down, I do not accept responsibility for it going up. Most commentators here would accept that the main determinants for inflation are as I have outlined for a number of years. They are largely outside our control. Fiscal policy, both now and previously, has a very limited effect on inflation. As I pointed out in this House on many occasions, if one were to take £3 billion or £4 billion out of the economy, either in expenditure reductions or taxation increases, it might have a small effect on inflation. Someone recently did the sum and it might mean 0.5% after about two and a half years, which no one is advocating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In January 2000, I reluctantly accepted the joint recommendation of the board of ACC Bank, the trustees of TSB Bank and the non-statutory board to abandon the merger and flotation of ACC and TSB Banks in the light of the slim prospects for a successful flotation in the then prevailing market conditions. I asked both banks to review all their options for the future. <Col N="512" /> Since then, TSB Bank undertook a successful sale process which resulted in its sale earlier this year to Irish Life and Permanent plc.</P>
      <P>I announced the publication of the ACC Bank Bill, 2001, on 31 January this year. In doing so, I stated that the board of ACC Bank had been mandated by me to prepare the bank for sale and I asked it to pursue all options in relation to a change in the ownership structure of the bank over the course of the next 12 months. The ACC Bank Act, 2001, was commenced on 15 June. The Act includes enabling provisions in relation to the sale of the bank such as the sale of shares held by the Minister for Finance, the establishment of an employee share ownership plan and the treatment of State guarantees following the sale of the bank.</P>
      <P>The management of the sale process is a matter for the board of ACC Bank and its advisers, NCB Corporate Finance and Matherson, Ormsby, Prentice. I expect it to be conducted in a transparent and fair manner for all concerned parties. The board will revert to me in due course with its proposals and recommendation. I have retained A and L Goodbody, solicitors, to be my legal advisers in relation to this sale process.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between the trade unions and management regarding the employee share ownership plan are in progress. The trade unions and management have already agreed the terms of a voluntary separation scheme.</P>
      <P>While ACC Bank had a difficult year in 2000, as reflected in its annual results which disclosed a loss before tax of 23 million, the prospects for the bank are good going forward. The once-off reasons for the loss include a 21 million provision to pay for the DIRT bill arising from the Revenue Commissioner's audit of the bank, a 16 million provision in relation to the voluntary separation scheme and a 14 million provision for bad and doubtful debts which arose from a fundamental review of the loan book, particularly the large scale corporate loans. It should be noted that the results included an 11% increase in the operating profit.</P>

        <i>
        </i>The bank has adopted a new strategy following a review of the bank's operations in early 2000 which involves moving away from general retail banking in order to concentrate on small and medium enterprise business banking, providing a more focused personal banking service and continuing to serve its original market, the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ACC Bank has had a difficult time in the past two years but it has addressed the issues and is making changes. I look forward to receiving proposals from the board in the timescale I announced in January and will give it my full consideration. If I decide to accept its recommendation, I will take the matter to Government and, in due course, seek a motion of approval from the House before proceeding with the sale of the shares, held by me as Minster for Finance, as I am required to do <Col N="513" /> under section 5 of the ACC Bank Act, 2001. Details of the board's proposals will then be given to the House in order to allow Deputies reach a fully informed view.</P>

    <P>Intensive negotiations have recently taken place between the unions and management. It is fair to say that, in the past decade or so, there was an unhappy relationship between the management and unions. There is no secret about this fact. The legislation provided for the commencement of the ESOP. Negotiations were slow to begin, but they are now under way. The restructuring is taking place and the bank is for sale. The board has appointed its corporate financial advisers and its legal advisers. A deadline was recently set for the receipt of indicative bids regarding the possible purchase of ACC Bank by other companies. Everyone is aware that we are moving forward. I have made it clear for some <Col N="514" /> time that the <i>status quo</i> will not remain and that the bank will be sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received any indications regarding investments in ACC Bank? The level of investments in the bank reduced for a period which was an unhealthy sign for a bank we are hoping to sell. Will the Minister comment on the savings scheme? ACC Bank appears to be offering the most attractive returns on the special savings scheme. Can the Minister comment on what I understand to be a large volume of investment in the scheme in ACC Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not know for some time how the institutions have worked out the scheme. However, ACC Bank has achieved a high market profile in terms of this scheme. It would not be correct for me to suggest which scheme is best. However, I would refer Deputies to the media interest and to the fact that some commentators and other bodies who kite mark these schemes have placed ACC Bank's scheme at the top of the list. Other players in the market would dispute this and I will not make a judgment as to which scheme is the best. However, the scheme has proved very attractive.</P>
      <P>ACC Bank is a sound financial institution. I agree with Deputy McGrath that hundreds of people who work for the bank have done an excellent job down the years and would compare well with staff in any other institution. It is unfortunate that there have been unhappy differences over the years, but the staff of ACC Bank are very professional.</P>

      <P>I understand that details such as name and address of the purchaser are retained at the relevant branch for a period of time which is determined by the data retention policy of the relevant credit institution. In general, details of the names of intended recipients of bank drafts are also retained at branch level. The retention period for these details is also defined by the individual institution. Aggregate data of bank drafts outstanding is not currently compiled. Therefore, an estimate of the value of bank drafts outstanding is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> I know Deputy Timmons previously expressed an interest in including bank drafts in the dormant accounts scheme. As I explained to the Deputy last week on Second Stage of the Dormant Accounts Bill, it would be premature to include bank drafts. Major legal issues such as the implications of the Statute of Limitations need to be considered. Consequently, I do not intend including them within the ambit of the scheme at present. However, the scheme may be extended to other products at a later stage and further consideration will be given to the inclusion of bank drafts when the relevant issues have been considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I now understand why bank drafts are not covered by the dormant accounts legislation. I raised this issue several times with the Minister and he is probably tired of me doing so. However, I must continue to press the issue. Does the Minister agree that hundreds of millions of pounds may be available by way of uncashed bank drafts? Would he agree that it might be a useful exercise for his Department to contact banks and ask them if, as a matter of courtesy, they would inform the Department of the amount of money contained in uncashed bank drafts, particularly those that are over ten years old? I am confident that some bank drafts are at least 50 years old.</P>
      <P>There is also a fraud dimension to this issue. I am concerned that a lot of money has been siphoned into bank drafts and that some individuals are waiting for an opportune time to cash these drafts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dormant Accounts Bill is enacted, banks and other institutions will have to do a lot of work over the next year to comply with the legislation. I will ask banks to make some estimate of the amount of money which may be contained in outstanding bank drafts. That will be a difficult process as the recipient, and not the purchaser, owns the draft. Banks may no longer have records of the intended recipients. When time permits and banks complete their work regarding the dormant accounts legislation, the next issue we will try to address is to obtain an estimate of the value of outstanding bank drafts.</P>
      <P>I suspect that records in some institutions may not go back very far. However, on Committee Stage of the Dormant Accounts Bill a Deputy drew attention to the fact that it had been suggested that banks did not keep records going back for a few years, yet other fora discovered that such records go back 20 or 30 years. Perhaps information is available, but it will be a major undertaking. I will have this matter investigated further when the dormant accounts legislation is up and running.</P>

If this bank can do so, the major banks should be able to do likewise. I am confident that, at the press of a button, the major banks would be able to do so. These banks have cleaned up their act in the past year or two and they would be able to identify the amount of money involved. I would be interested to know how much is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm referred to in the article is under criminal investigation by the Garda Síochána. I am, therefore, unable to comment specifically on the case.</P>
      <P>On a more general note, firms authorised under the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, operate under obligations imposed by the Act, and requirements-regulations imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Irish Stock Exchange which cover, <i>inter alia</i>, capital, financial and conduct of business issues.</P>
      <P>The capital requirement for stockbrokers is calculated as provided for in the capital adequacy directive and determined by the nature of investment business activities undertaken by the firm. Under the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, responsibility for the enforcement of conduct of business rules rests with the Irish Stock Exchange. The conduct of business rules are subject to agreement with the bank.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank has imposed general supervisory and advertising requirements on stockbrokers, and these include reporting requirements. All stockbrokers are required to submit to the bank monthly management accounts and a capital adequacy return within 20 days of the month's end. In addition, stockbrokers submit a weekly report to the bank, which includes details of the firm's cash liability to clients compared to client bank account balances, the funding contributed by the firm in order to settle client transactions, and background information on the level of client debtors. All stockbrokers are required to submit annual audited accounts to the bank within six months of the financial year's end. This requirement applies irrespective of whether the firm is a limited company or a partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, section 52 of the Act places certain obligations on firms, including requirements with respect to clients' money and investment instruments. Section 70 provides that failure to comply <Col N="517" /> with these requirements constitutes an offence. All stockbrokers have been required under section 52(3)(<i>d</i>) of the Act to commission an annual audit of the firm's compliance with the Central Bank's requirements in relation to client money and investment instruments, including whether the firm has maintained adequate systems and controls for safe custody throughout the year. Section 34(3) of the Act also provides that an auditor of a stockbroker shall report to the bank in writing without delay where the auditor has certain concerns regarding the firm.</P>
    <P>As regards the adequacy of the Central Bank's procedures for regulating this sector, my Department wrote to the bank on 25 May 2001, seeking its views on what the implications of this case might be for the regulatory regime in this sector and, particularly, whether any modifications to the relevant legislation might be required. The bank replied on 29 May 2001 that it was much too early in the investigation to give a definitive opinion as to whether legislative or regulatory modifications might be required. It will, however, conduct a review of its procedures as part of its examination of the facts surrounding the collapse of this firm and then let me have its definitive response. If any legislative or regulatory shortcomings are identified, I will ensure these will be tackled as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the collapse of the firm of W and R Morrogh in Cork, following the collapse last year of NMI, is a worrying development? Investors are entitled to be concerned that there appears to be inadequate regulatory control of strockbroking firms. Does the Minister agree, in particular, that the procedures he has just described effectively amount to a reporting procedure and are inadequate in determining whether a particular firm or stockbroker is actually complying with the law? If somebody is determined not to comply with the law &ndash; I am not commenting on this particular case &ndash; it will not necessarily be turned up by reports which are voluntarily, or otherwise, sent in by the stockbroker on a regular basis. What we need is a more hands-on investigative procedure which would allow the Central Bank, or those acting on its behalf, to inspect the records of a particular firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank does inspect the records of many of these institutions. Whereas I would not be privy to the operations of the bank on a day-to-day basis, I can tell the Deputy that every day of every week it regularly conducts investigations into many firms. Some 99% of that activity never reaches the public press because nothing ever happens. It is never possible to guard against people acting in an incorrect manner. As the Deputy will be aware from his previous occupation as a solicitor, during the years many solicitors have misappropriated funds. The Law Society has tightened up its regu<Col N="518" /> lations and procedures but one will never be able to guard 100% against such occurrences.</P>
      <P>If, as a result of the investigation into this particular firm, it is shown that more regulations or legislative measures are required, I will not hesitate to introduce them. I do not think, however, that we will ever get to a situation &ndash; either with solicitors, accountants or stockbrokers &ndash; where one can guard fully against slip-ups. All one can do is rely on the existing mechanisms, which include reporting procedures and auditing requirements, and hope people comply with them.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious concerns expressed by a senior trade union official (details supplied) representing tax inspectors that special tax breaks for employees on share options introduced in the Finance Act, 2001, amounted to a tax evasion scheme; the steps he will take to address these concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19037/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the various criticisms expressed by certain elements of the trade union movement of the changes I made to the tax treatment of share option schemes, and do not accept them. The tax treatment of approved share option schemes, which is based on legislation <Col N="519" /> approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas this year, could not be regarded as amounting to a tax evasion or avoidance scheme. Tax evasion involves an individual deliberately, and in breach of the relevant legislation, not paying the appropriate taxation due. Tax avoidance means using a scheme in a manner for which it was never intended by the Legislature.</P>
      <P>I have already addressed the House, for example in a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 61 on 17 May 2001, on the tax treatment of approved share option schemes as provided for in the Finance Act, 2001, and set out in some detail the way in which the new arrangements will operate. Under the approved scheme, employees will no longer be chargeable to income tax on the exercise of share options but will now be chargeable to capital gains tax on the full gain, that is, the difference between the amount paid for the shares and the amount received when they are sold.</P>
      <P>The scheme must, in particular, be available to all employees on similar terms. While there may be a key employee element in which share options can be granted without the similar terms conditions, at least 70% of the shares must be available for the all-employee part of the scheme. Furthermore, the scheme must not contain features that would discourage qualifying employees from participating, or have the effect of conferring benefits wholly or mainly on directors or higher paid employees of the company. I do not accept that this will allow for schemes where the beneficiaries will effectively be a small group of highly paid executives, self-selected as key workers, as suggested in the concerns referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The all-employee and key employee element of the scheme provides a good balance between the twin objectives of facilitating the participation by all the employees in the fortunes of the company they work for, and helping companies to retain staff vital to their success in a difficult national and international labour market.</P>
      <P>Under these new arrangements, to obtain approval from the Revenue Commissioners, share option schemes must comply with the terms of the legislation. Apart for the recent change to the share option legislation, favourable and generous tax benefits already exist for various employee share schemes, including approved profit-sharing schemes and employee share ownership trusts. One of the main reasons for giving favourable tax treatment to such schemes is to encourage employees to gain a stake in their employing company and such treatment for these schemes is supported by many parts of the trade union movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the absence of a ceiling and the presence of the so-called key employee element in this scheme are a method by which a small number of already highly paid employees, or managers for that mat<Col N="520" /> ter, can effectively reduce their marginal rate of tax from 42% to 20%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a number of budgets and Finance Bills we discussed the possibility of reintroducing share option schemes as they once existed. Much thought was given to the matter. The PPF included a proviso that a group would examine all these matters, including share option schemes. It is not possible to reach universal agreement with everybody involved in this area. Many of the points the Deputy raises were also raised on Committee Stage and considered by me. I decided to go for this particular scheme to see how it would work. I do not have much evidence to date on whether it has been a great success: the information coming to me is that people are quite slow in taking it up. It was time to address the area of share options, and many trade union members strongly support the idea. This was reported to me by one particular official but there are four or five others to whom I can also refer who support the scheme.</P>

      <P>The relocation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development laboratories and the State Laboratory from Abbotstown to new facilities at Backweston, Celbridge, County Kildare is estimated at £157 million, including site works, construction costs, design team fees, VAT and inflation. A comprehensive estimate of the cost of moving the Marine Institute laboratories from Abbotstown to Galway must await the acquisition of a site and the completion of a detailed brief of require<Col N="521" /> ments, but the estimated construction cost of the new laboratories in Galway is £31 million, including inflation, fees and VAT. Following an agreement at departmental council, staff representatives are informed of the outcome of every meeting of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and which is responsible for overseeing the relocation of laboratory facilities from Abbotstown.</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy no compensation or removal expenses will be paid to civil servants relocating to Backweston and Galway. However, non-Civil Service fixed contract staff working at the Marine Institute who do not wish to move will benefit from a severance package being negotiated. The precise costs of this package will not be known until final agreement is reached.   </P>

The Government is reviewing the Sports Campus Ireland project, but we are in advance of that and proceeding with the preparation of documents. When the review is completed, it will confirm the information I have given this afternoon, and we will be able to proceed with these facilities. These laboratories are needed, and the question of whether it is Abbotstown or Backweston is immaterial in terms of cost.

      <P>I have heard this spurious argument made on numerous occasions in the House. The State holds property and landbanks throughout the country that are vital to its interests in a range of areas. A range of facilities are created on almost a weekly basis for various Departments under the auspices of the Office of Public Works. Deputies contact me on a weekly basis regarding Garda stations and other matters. We are fortunate that the State acquired this property which allows us to pursue important infrastructural developments on a scale not been seen before. Where a property is purchased for a project the price is included in the costs.</P>

This property belongs to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and we are fortunate to have it in an ideal location to provide state-of-the-art State laboratories.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy McGrath that I expect to be successful in the context of locating a site in Galway. It would be logical to locate the Marine Institute in an area that has strong marine associations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the first monthly returns made by the qualifying savings managers under the new savings scheme, the total tax credits claimed by the institutions amount to some £1.5 million in respect of deposits of £6 million in the month of May. Details of the number of accounts involved will not become available until the first annual return due under the scheme is made by the savings managers on or before 28 February 2002. As I indicated recently when replying to a parliamentary question from Deputy Howlin regarding the likely cost of the scheme, it is difficult to estimate the Exchequer cost of the special savings incentive scheme because of its very nature &ndash; it is new and innovative and the size of the Exchequer contribution will depend on take-up by participants in the scheme. In developing proposals for the Finance Bill provisions my Department considered various ranges of costs depending on different assumptions. As I said on February 20th in reply to Dáil Question No. 36 from Deputy Jim Mitchell, a tentative estimate is for a full-year cost of around £100 million for the savings scheme. In so far as the take-up turns out to be very strong, then this figure may have to be revised upward. The more successful the scheme is, the more relief it will entail.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to extrapolate from the figures available to date what a more likely cost to the Exchequer of the SSIA scheme will be. It is anticipated, however, that the June returns will show an increase on the May figures.</P>

They also estimated that 84% of the benefit of the scheme would go to households with an income of more than £25,000 a year and that one-third would go to households earning more than £50,000 a year.

This is the only scheme that was ever introduced which is open to everybody. It is a tax-based scheme. It is my own idea, has proved particularly attractive and gives the same benefit to everybody, whether one pays tax at 42% or 20% or does not pay tax at all. Remember the result of successful policy initiatives of mine, not taking account of all the advice I received from Deputy McDowell. There are now 668,000 out of 1.7 million taxpayers who are out of the tax net altogether and the scheme will be available to them also. This scheme is egalitarian in its approach.</P>

      <P>The minimum contribution is £10 a month which is £2.50 a week. Though I do not drink anymore, that is definitely less than the price of a pint in Dublin, Kildare or Westmeath. The figures for the first month show the scheme has cost the Exchequer £1.5 million on total deposits of £6 million. People might say that is very low. I caution Deputies against extrapolating from the figures what might be the likely outcome of this scheme because the figures for June will be somewhat greater. My nose tells me that there is a considerable level of interest among all classes of people.</P>
      <P>We will not have any evidence for some time, it be a year or two, to answer the question asked by Deputy McGrath about the transfer of savings.

The application was evaluated by consultants engaged by my Department and presented to the evaluation group in my Department who reported to me on 14 June. The evaluation group considered the consultant's report and, in agreeing with their overall recommendation, have recommended to me that the licence be granted to the applicant, An Post National Lottery Company.

      <P>The process was open and transparent. Two other companies joined it and withdrew at a late stage having, I would guess, invested a lot of money in it. It would have cost substantial sums because a great deal of information was gathered by them and they put a large team in place. They decided to withdraw late in the day at a time when most of the costs had been incurred. An Post National Lottery Company Ltd. was the only company left but we still con<Col N="527" /> tinued the process to its conclusion. We had legal advice stating that was the safer course.</P>
      <P>The certain provisions referred to relate to a number of issues in the draft licence, which might no longer be relevant given the applicant is a State-owned company and the current licence holder. The provisions are modifications of the draft licence, it being necessary to get a legal sign off before proceeding. One could look at this from the perspective that the An Post National Lottery Company is doing the job so well that the other competitors decided to cut their losses at the stage they did. They did not tell me why they did so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may have put the question regarding consultants to a wide range of Departments during the Estimates debate last week in the committee. There was a definite need to appoint consultants on this occasion as there was such an amount of detailed documentation. I do not have the final figure as to what the bill from the consultants will be but I will get it for the Deputy. The consultants were Deloitte and Touche who were chosen after a competitive tendering process. I assure Deputies that in this case the knowledge would not have been available to my Department or any other as we would not have had the resources available to us. It was a mammoth task as the documentation was very detailed.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell asked about the companies which pulled out. They incurred a lot of costs in going so far with this as the task was onerous and we needed consultants in this instance.</P>

      <P>Planning for implementation of the Government decision announced on 20 February to establish the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority within the new structure of the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Authority is now well under way. The Government yesterday approved the drafting of legislation on the basis of heads prepared by my Department in consultation with the Tánaiste's Department. I will now be consulting the European Central Bank with regard to the proposals.</P>
      <P>Closely related proposals concerning the establishment of a statutory ombudsman scheme, consumer and industry consultative panels and other financial services regulation issues are being developed in parallel with this legislation. These will be provided for in a Bill, the provisions of which will be brought to Government as soon as they are ready.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will operate from the beginning of 2002 and I hope to be in a position to introduce legislation in the autumn session to provide for this. In order to facilitate that target, I intend, in consultation with the Tánaiste, to set up an interim board for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority on a non-statutory basis before the formal establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recommendation of the McDowell report, it is my intention that this authority will be a public interest board. The non-executive members will be selected for their experience of legal, financial and consumer issues. It is also my intention that the chief executive and the consumer director will be appointed before the formal establishment of the new authority. Both these executives will also sit on the board of the authority. I will make an announcement on the membership of the authority in the normal way in due course.</P>

      <P>I hope to be in a position shortly to appoint the members of the interim board after consultation with the Tánaiste and then the board will go about the business of recruiting a chief executive and a consumer director. In order to speed up this process we have engaged outside legal expertise and a full-time team has been working on this for a number of months. As I said in my reply, the Government will approve the drafting of legislation on the basis of the heads of a Bill and we hope to have this legislation for the autumn with a view to having it enacted by 1 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a major undertaking and it is all systems <Col N="529" /> go to have it in place. However, as I pointed out yesterday it is a very tight timetable.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, under section 111(6) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 96 of 1998, my consent is required to the charging of a fee for such licences. The question of when the licences are awarded is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
      <P>In fulfilling my statutory responsibility I will be concerned to ensure that the fees paid adequately reflect the value of the licences issued, taking account of the non-financial obligations involved in the licence terms and of the importance of third generation mobile telephony to the development of the telecoms infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confirm that I have received a request for my consent to revised fee proposals from the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. Follow<Col N="530" /> ing receipt of these proposals, I asked my advisers to reconsider the position in the light of these new proposals and any other relevant considerations. In this context, my advisers met the advisers to the director and have recently furnished me with their assessment of the latest proposals. Consultations in the matter are proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister met with the director since his reported meeting of 2 February last? The situation was never intended to be like this. When the director employs advisers and the Minister employs advisers to deal with the director, we are getting to a level of chess-playing between Government bodies that was never intended as part of the legislation. It was never intended or expected that the Minister employ, as I understand he has, outside consultants to advise him as to whether he should accept a recommendation from the director. This suggests either a defect in the legislation or that the process we are engaged in is not what was intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy raised the point, the legislation is clear but unsatisfactory. The question of deciding whether it should be a beauty contest or an auction was a matter in the legislation to be solely decided by the director. My function is that the director sends me a submission and I have a say over the fee. However, I cannot put forward a new proposal. My job is to either reject or accept this, which is unsatisfactory. That issue is being addressed in the new Bill being brought forward by the Minister for Public Enterprise. The legislation is clear cut but very unsatisfactory, as the Deputy pointed out.</P>
      <P>I had a formal face to face meeting on one occasion with the director. I would have to check the records but I think it was after 21 February, when I last answered oral Parliamentary Questions on this matter. I had one meeting with the director. However, my advisers have had various meetings. As Minister for Finance I have obligations to the State on behalf of the Exchequer. I am obliged to take advice on to what is being put to me, particularly as this is an area in which I profess no more expertise than any other Member.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting of economic and finance ministers, ECOFIN, which I attended on 5 June 2001 in Luxembourg, consisted of a number of issues. Under the heading of &ldquo;Preparation for the Gothenburg European Council&rdquo;, three issues were discussed. These were the 2001 broad economic policy guidelines or BEPGs, sustainable development and taxation issues. In regard to the BEPGs, the Council agreed on the text to be sent to the Gothenburg European Council for political endorsement by the Heads of State and Government. The BEPGs would then be formally adopted by a special session of ECOFIN in Gothenburg.</P>
      <P>The annual BEPGs are intended to define the main objectives and policy orientations for European economic policy in general and for individual member states over a 12 month period. The section of the 2001 guidelines which applies to all member states identifies three main challenges for the future: in the short-term to preserve the expansion in growth and jobs, in the medium term to improve the basis for future growth and employment and in the longer term to prepare for the impact of the ageing population</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section of the guidelines on Ireland notes that economic growth is slowing due to the slowdown in the US and the effects of foot and mouth disease, and that inflation is set to moderate. The <Col N="532" /> guidelines recommend that budgetary policy be used to ease demand in the economy and public expenditure control be strengthened. They acknowledge our strong employment growth, that we are well exposed to international competition, and the ongoing structural change in our capital markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland, like most other member states, had before Gothenburg sought a number of amendments to the draft guidelines, some of which have been reflected in the final text. We set out our position in a minute statement &ndash; which draws attention to the views we expressed at the time the recommendation to Ireland in respect of the 2000 BEPGs was being considered at the ECOFIN of 12 February 2001, and to the uncertainties which are inherent in macroeconomic forecasts on which the guidelines are necessarily based &ndash; which was included in the minutes of the ECOFIN meeting of 5 June.</P>
    <P>Returning to the other items discussed at ECOFIN, the Council had an exchange of views on the Commission's communication on sustainable development. The Council also took note of a number of reports relating to the tax package, the taxation of savings and the code of conduct and approved conclusions with regard to the taxation of savings and the code of conduct, and with regard to the future work on all aspects of the tax package. Under the heading of indirect taxation, Ministers examined the issue of VAT on e-commerce and energy taxation. Council agreed that discussions on these issues would continue.</P>
    <P>Ministers took note of the Commission's progress report on the implementation of the financial services action plan and welcomed the adoption of the key directives on the reorganisation and winding-up of credit institutions and insurance undertakings. Ministers also agreed in principle on macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and agreed conclusions relating to the financial regulation applicable to the EU budget and to the fight against fraud. The lunch-time discussion included progress on the Lamfalussy report on the regulation of the European securities market, economic dialogue with Russia, and the usual Presidency debriefing on the Eurogroup meeting which was held the previous evening.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain the standing of his minute statement on the meeting in Luxembourg? Is it not the case, notwithstanding the minutes, that the broad economic guidelines still require him, using fiscal policy, to bring budgetary strategy in Ireland into line with the 2000 BEPGs? Is it not the case that the Minister intends to do nothing in advance of the September review of the reprimand delivered at the start of this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made clear in a number of cases the standing of the Article 99(4) recommendation. My main concern in dealing with the 2001 specific country guidelines relating to <Col N="533" /> Ireland was to get out of the recommendation on last year's broad economic policy guidelines. We felt that was necessary. It is last year's business and related to last year's BEPGs. There was no need to repeat it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The standing of the minute statement in any Council is that a particular country can express its reservations or record its understanding of events in the minutes. The broad economic policy guidelines are as they are. The treaty obligations are under the stability and growth pact, of which we are still the star pupil in the class.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider special concessions and exemptions of stamp and other such revenue duties when a person is purchasing a house for a disabled relative; if he will give favourable consideration to such a proposal; if he will set up a working group to consider implications in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to stamp duty, where a person purchases a house for a disabled relative or for any other person, the purchaser can qualify for either the first time buyer or other owner-occupier buyer stamp duty rates provided the house is occupied by his/her relative or any other person on behalf of the purchaser as a principal private residence and no rent is derived from the property for five years after the purchase or until the house is sold.</P>
      <P>Last year, in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2000, I increased the stamp duty exemption threshold for first time owner-occupier buyers of second-hand residential property from £60,000 to £150,000 and for other owner-occupiers to £100,000. The rates were reduced for transfers at the lower end of the market for properties in excess of these amounts. Many first time owner-occupier buyers of second-hand houses are now either exempt from stamp duty or pay at a reduced rate. However, owner-occupiers who are not first-time buyers also benefit generally from the revised stamp duty rates.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that there is no stamp duty on the sale of new residential property where the purchaser is an owner-occupier and the house is not greater than 125 square metres. If a new house in such cases is more than 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged on the site value only, subject to a minimum site value of one quarter of the full house value. In the case outlined by the Deputy, the purchaser would be considered an owner-occupier in such cases subject to the conditions already outlined above.</P>
      <P>I have no plans, at present, to introduce any further changes to the stamp duty structure applying for second-hand houses or to set up a working group in this regard. However, the general stamp duty position for residential property will be kept under review in the light of developments in the housing market. As regards other taxes, the sale of new property is subject to VAT at 12.5%. The VAT rating of goods and services is largely subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can maintain the zero rating on those goods and services which were zero rated before 1 January 1991, we cannot introduce any new zero rate of VAT. Therefore, we cannot relieve the purchase of any new property of VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I was particularly interested by his comments on the working group detailed to investigate the issue of stamp duty on second-hand purchases. Deputies McDowell and Mitchell will be aware of the high price of houses in Dublin. I have been in contact with a number of people who are in the fortunate position of being able to purchase properties for their disabled children. As Members will understand, these people like such properties to be located in close proximity to their own homes. At present, a house in the Dublin area costs in the region of £250,000 and such a purchase entails a burden in terms of stamp duty and other excise duties and taxes which must be paid. Will the Minister ask the working group to consider how people in the lucky position of being able to purchase a house for their disabled children rather than being obliged to place them in institutionalised care might be accommodated in this regard? There is merit in providing assistance to the people to whom I refer because of the obvious benefits it would have for communities.</P>

      <P>I would not like to rule out any innovative suggestion in this regard. However, I have tinkered around to quite an extent with stamp duty in recent years and I am not overly given to the idea of introducing further categories in this area for obvious reasons such as the possibility of abuse, avoidance, etc. However, I will consider the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since 1996, a total of 14 criminal cases, including five cases where the investigation was undertaken by the Garda, in respect of serious tax offences were concluded in the courts. Convictions were obtained in 13 cases. Terms of imprisonment were imposed by the courts in five of the cases. In three cases the prison term was suspended while in the other two prison terms are currently being served. In addition to these serious criminal offences, Revenue also has an ongoing programme of bringing prosecutions for failure to file income and corporation tax returns. A total of 3,707 convictions in <Col N="536" /> respect of this type of prosecution have been obtained over the past five years. I propose to circulate details of the data requested by the Deputy on a year by year basis in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>At present, there are three serious criminal cases before the courts and summonses are being issued in three further cases. A report has been prepared for the DPP in another case and a further 28 are under investigation with a view to preparing a file for submission to the DPP. Revenue also undertakes prosecutions for customs and excise offences. Since 1996, and to date in 2001, in the region of 1,550 convictions have been obtained for such offences.</P>

      <Quest>the number of court awards and out of court settlements made in regard to claims by employees in the Leinster House complex as a result of exposure to asbestos dust; the total amount paid to date; the number of such claims pending; if all asbestos has now been removed from the Leinster House complex; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>To date there have been two court <Col N="537" /> awards and two out of court settlements, totalling £179,260 in all, made in respect of claims by employees of the Office of Public Works in the Leinster House complex as a result of alleged exposure to asbestos. There are a further 22 claims pending.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has completed an asbestos survey of all visible and accessible areas of Leinster House. Any asbestos identified during the survey, with the exception of some external roof tiles, has been removed by specialist contractors commissioned for the work. The tiles to which I refer will be replaced as soon as possible. They pose no significant health risk at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter came to my attention by way of a press report of a court hearing during the course of which the presiding judge made some comments which were disquieting to say the least. The judge in question said he found it extraordinary that the Office of Public Works had been aware for a long period that there was an asbestos problem in Leinster House. Is the Minister of State in a position to confirm whether the judge's assertion is accurate? Do I understand from his initial reply that the Office of Public Works and the State are continuing to deny liability in respect of the outstanding cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delve into the detail of the case in question. However, I am aware of what was said and I was somewhat disappointed by the comments that were made because they were unfair and did not reflect what was happening. I assure the Deputy that the Office of Public Works acted immediately to remove the asbestos when it was discovered. In the specific case in question the person involved is not suffering from exposure to asbestos. As I understand it, he has been affected by worry and stress. In light of the review, there are a number of cases outstanding and I am taking advice from the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General. I am considering the position in the context of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Asbestos is to be found in many public buildings, particularly schools, throughout the country. Some of these have been surveyed and reports were made that remedial action was required. Is it not true that the State has been slow to provide the funding to facilitate remedial works? There will be a litany of court cases in respect of this matter unless action is taken. As Deputy McDowell stated, if the information was available to the Department for a long period prior to the case in question being taken it will be found to be negligent. Is it not time that an urgent review of public buildings, particularly schools, was carried out and that the necessary <Col N="538" /> funding was provided to remove asbestos from these buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of a lack of funding in this area. I assure the House that this extremely important issue is being dealt with. There are approximately 6,000 buildings which come under the care of my Department and we acted immediately, based on information provided to us by various Departments, schools, etc., in all cases where asbestos was discovered. In all instances we have acted to secure the buildings in question and ensure that the asbestos was removed.</P>
      <P>Most of the discoveries of asbestos relate to buildings that were built before 1980. Many of the 6,000 buildings to which I refer were erected post-1980 and it is highly unlikely that they contain asbestos. To date, work has been completed on over 1,900 buildings while there are a number of buildings in respect of which works are either outstanding or in the process of being carried out. Specialist contractors are required to carry out such works and many are fully engaged in asbestos removal at present.</P>
      <P>When I entered office I put in place a specialist dedicated team to deal with this matter. I am satisfied that we are on top of the problem and the different bodies involved acknowledge that an excellent job is being done. I am unaware of any immediate risks to people's health but I am in a position to confirm that we are trying to complete works on a number of buildings at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>All Departments are currently accessible directly by telephone during normal working hours. A quality customer service, QCS, initiative was launched throughout the Civil Service in 1997 as part of the strategic management initiative. The objective of quality customer service is to promote the wider adoption of improved customer service standards by all Departments in order to help the smooth despatch of public business. Each Minister is responsible for ensuring that quality customer services is provided in his or her Department. To facilitate this process, each Department is required to produce a customer service action plan indicating how full effect is given to various guiding principles for the delivery of quality customer service. Furthermore, the guidelines for the operation of the scheme of flexible working hours specify that there must be adequate staffing during normal working hours. This provision is to ensure that an adequate service is provided to <Col N="539" /> Departments' customers, including telephone callers.</P>
      <P>A code of practice for telephone use has been in operation in my Department for some time as part of its customer service action plan. Under this code every member of staff is required to answer all incoming telephone calls promptly and be as helpful and informative as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister may have misinterpreted the question, which refers to direct access to various Departments for Deputies. He will be aware from his days on the back benches that the Department of Social, Community and Social Affairs has a particularly good service which is available to Deputies. I compliment those responsible for manning the telephones in that Department. There is a hot line in the Minister's Department where two girls are brilliant in sorting out problems. That is the kind of service to which Deputy Deasy referred. Other Departments, such as that of the Tanáiste, to which one can make several calls to the Minister's office&mdash;</P>

That is unsatisfactory. We need a direct line for Members. That service, as the Minister is aware, was never abused and provided for us in good faith. We operated it ourselves and numbers were not circulated. The two Departments in question are excellent. Other Departments should provide a similar service.</P>

I welcome the comments about my Department. I will bear in mind what the Deputy says and see if the system can be introduced to all Departments for Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my time as Minister of Finance, and before, voicemail, which frustrates the Deputies, frustrates me twice as much. I can contact the Secretary General, the second secretaries and the important members of staff, but as I work my way down I get voicemails. I do not know if anyone is ever there. Like Deputy McGrath, I have no difficulty contacting the senior officials in my Department who answer the telephone them<Col N="540" /> selves but below that with term and other breaks I always get voicemails. I will raise the matter myself and try to ensure Departments have at least two telephone lines available to Members by following the example of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>On 31 January this year in a press release announcing the publication of the ACC Bank Bill, 2001, I mandated the board and management of ACC Bank to pursue a change in ownership over the course of the next year. The board appointed NCB Corporate Finance as financial adviser and is in the second phase of a sale process. The number of indicative bids received on 11 June is solely a matter for the board and chairman of ACC Bank. I have no involvement in the sale process. It is intended that, similar to the ICC sale process, the board will come to me with a recommendation by the end of this year. I will give any proposal my full consideration. If I choose to accept its proposal, I will bring the matter to Government. In accordance with section 5 of the ACC Bank Act, 2001, enacted on 29 May, I am required to seek a motion of approval from the House before proceeding with any disposal of shares. The House will be fully informed of all details of any proposal made to me by the board at that time.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is before the House because the Government wants to force through a waste management strategy based on incineration. It is in this position because in its four years in office it neglected the waste issue and failed to provide the necessary leadership to deal with it. When it came into office, it knew that there was a serious waste problem. Not until my colleague, Deputy Howlin, introduced the Waste Management Act, 1996, did the country face up legislatively to this problem. We are unique in Europe in landfilling over 90% of non-agricultural waste. It is now a crisis. The number of landfills is reducing. EU directives and legislation limit the material that can go into landfill. As the Minister stated, we are being taken to the European Court and may be fined, which the taxpayers will daily pay, because of non-compliance with EU waste legislation. Every county has a difficulty over waste management.</P>
      <P>In response to the crisis, the Government pursues a two track approach &ndash; a public policy and a private plan. The public policy is contained in Changing Our Ways, published in 1998, and hauled out in various statements issued by the Minister and speeches made by him in which he subscribes to what the Minister of State calls the international accepted hierarchy of waste. We will, in theory, minimise waste and reuse, recycle, recover and do all the things dictated by good environmental practice. There is no disagreement about this. The problem is, however, that the Government does not believe in doing that. While it mouths a public policy position which subscribes to the waste hierarchy idea, in practice it pursues a private plan based on the acceptance at official level that the way to deal with waste is to incinerate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While various statements are being made publicly by Ministers about the waste hierarchy, <Col N="543" /> recycling, Changing Our Ways etc, there is a cold view taken at official level, both centrally and at local government level, that all this old guff about recycling is great for ministerial press releases but the way to deal with the waste problem is to gather it all up and put it in an incinerator. That is the reason the regional strategy is being pursued and the Minister ordered that local authorities should combine in regional groupings to adopt regional waste management plans. It was not that he had any great commitment to the idea of regional policy but these waste regions were constructed on the premise that there would be an incinerator in each. That particular plan has now come unstuck because some local authorities will not roll over and do the Minister's bidding. The reason we have this Bill before us is because the Minister, faced with that situation, wants to force the issue. He wants to force local authorities to pursue a pre-ordained plan based on incinerating waste.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the concerns of many about the health and environmental implications of incineration. Those concerns cannot and should not be dismissed in the light and facetious way that they are being dismissed by Government and official sources. People are tired and weary of official reassurances. They were reassured before about the quality of blood, food and a whole range of matters. Now they are getting an official assurance in relation to the so-called safety of incineration. It is quite understandable that people, particularly in areas where it is proposed to locate incinerators, are concerned about the health and environmental implications of incineration. They have a right to voice those concerns and structures established for local governance should be capable of dealing with them. They should not be set aside as they are in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from the health and environmental concerns there is also the question as to whether this is the right strategy to pursue in relation to our waste management. If we give priority, as the Government does, to developing an end-of-pipe solution to waste based on incineration, we effectively neglect the necessary investment in infrastructure needed to underpin recycling and recovery.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is the only political party to have produced an alternative to the Government strategy on waste. Earlier this year we published a comprehensive document, outlining and costing an alternative strategy. We pointed out that it is possible and desirable to develop a strategy based on recycling. We took the target, contained in the Changing Our Ways document, of 35% for the national recycling of municipal waste and the targets set out in the various regional and local waste management plans drawn up mainly by the consultancy firm M. C. O'Sullivan and accepted them. We said if we could achieve those targets for recycling, recovery and reuse, that would make a huge impact on reducing the scale of the <Col N="544" /> waste problem to be addressed here. In order to meet those targets we have to do more than issue ministerial press releases about recycling. We have to invest in a recycling infrastructure.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Deasy and other Deputies said, it is all very well to talk about recycling but it must be physically done somewhere. We can talk about recycling paper but the recycling and reprocessing activity must actually be physically performed. To do that we have to invest in recycling infrastructure. What passes for recycling here is pilot schemes, experimental projects and the odd bottle bank in the corner of a supermarket car park. That just scratches the surface. The amount of waste collected for recycling at those centres is just a tiny fraction of the total amount available for collection. We have to develop the infrastructure, the separated collection system and markets for recycled products. We are aware that there is a problem with markets for recycled products.</P>
    <P>Instead of legislation designed to facilitate a fast-track approach to incineration what we need is an alternative strategy where we take and accept the targets set down in official documents and policy statements, invest in the infrastructure to provide recycling facilities and provide the collection systems designed to facilitate recycling. The various wheelie bins, etc., being provided in our major urban centres are not designed for recycling. If they were, they would provide for separated collection. They provide for a system of collection where everything goes into the wheelie bin, gets tipped into a lorry and is eventually taken away and burned. That is the system being developed and invested in. We need a different approach.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's opposition to this Bill is based on two matters. It is based, first, on its undemocratic nature, the effective standing down of local democracy and the normal planning process for waste facilities. Second, it is based on our belief that the strategy being pursued by the Government, which is essentially based on incineration, is flawed. It is flawed environmentally and economically. We should pursue an alternative strategy based on recycling for which the Labour Party has already set out a blueprint in its waste management document published earlier this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001. This is an important Bill dealing with what is a serious challenge for all of us. That challenge is the huge level of waste being generated as a result of our unprecedented levels of economic growth and the increasing affluence of our society. Central and local government have been slow to tackle this challenge in sharp contrast to the action taken by many of our EU colleagues. While it is true that a small minority of citizens have been demanding action and leading the call for policies on waste management and recycling, it must be said that most, until recently, were not aware of the serious <Col N="545" /> problems facing us. There are probably still some who believe we can continue to put rubbish out for collection to be disposed of in landfill sites at no cost. That is no longer the case. If people believe this we will have to embark on a major public awareness and information programme to explain the facts.</P>
      <P>This Bill aims to provide for the making and adoption of waste management plans by city and county managers. It seeks to make this matter an Executive function. It also aims to provide for an introduction of an environmental levy on plastic shopping bags, a levy on the landfill of waste and the establishment of an environment fund.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, local authorities have failed on the issue of waste management. This Bill is necessary to ensure that the current, long-running waste management process is finalised and that delays in bringing forward a regional approach and putting a waste management infrastructure in place are brought to an end. Such a waste management infrastructure includes recycling, thermal treatment and landfill disposal. The adoption of waste management plans at a regional level is now urgent. We can no longer avoid the issue, 90% of our waste is now landfilled. Such a high figure is unique to Ireland among EU countries. New landfill sites are, for various reasons, unavailable while existing sites are coming to the end of their natural lives. EU targets can no longer be set aside. A real problem demands real and practical solutions. We are living in cloud cuckoo land if we think otherwise.</P>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I am generally not happy about giving more powers to city and county managers. Unfortunately, that is the only option available to the Minister at this time. I am glad he is giving these powers to the managers who are, after all, part of the local government structure. Managers are still obliged to at least report to councillors and listen to their advice. I am happy the Minister did not take the alternative course of action open to him and establish a national waste management authority, as was mooted at one time. It would have been a quango, independent of local government and completely undemocratic and unaccountable.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State outlined earlier in this debate that the plans of some local authorities were being held up by a small number of neighbouring authorities acting undemocratically. I note his views. It is unacceptable that one local authority can hold up the adoption of a regional waste management plan when all other authorities in that area have agreed it. This Bill is an attempt to deal with that unfortunate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall Government policy on waste management is set out in the Changing Our Ways policy document of 1998. It listed five forms of action: prevention, minimisation, re-use and re-cycling, energy recovery and safe disposal. I stress that the incinerator or thermal treatment is only one part of the strategy. This is a very controversial matter and a major political issue in many communities. Health concerns are the primary <Col N="546" /> focus of this debate and rightly so. They must be thoroughly addressed. Nevertheless, we need a rational and informed debate. We must deal with the rumours and myths which surround the issue.</P>
    <P>All sorts of views have been advanced regarding thermal treatment. It is said that proposals for waste management planning in Ireland amount to nothing more than incineration but that is simply not the case. As I mentioned earlier, several other options outlined in Changing Our Ways are being pursued simultaneously. It is said that incineration is being abandoned in Europe, that is not true. It is not being abandoned by the European Commission as various directives demonstrate. The European Commission is not anti-incineration. It is said that incineration is being banned in some European countries, once again that is not true. It is not true of Germany, Denmark or Austria, where thermal treatment is part of waste management strategies. It is said that a proposal for an incinerator in Douglas, Isle of Man, is being delayed indefinitely because of health concerns. The facts do not support that. There are various policy documents issued by the governing authorities in the Isle of Man which demonstrate that.</P>
    <P>It is said that waste incineration is the primary cause of dioxins, yet there are many other sources of dioxins to which we are exposed. Dioxin levels in the milk of Danish cows is said to be 12 times higher than that in Ireland. Information compiled by the Department of the Environment and Local Government refutes that. It is said that countries which use incineration for municipal waste have higher incidences of cancer than those that do not. This is a very simplistic argument which fails to take into account that the incidence of cancer is determined by a wide range of factors and not just dioxins. It is said that zero waste policies in places such as Canberra, Australia, show that waste management can be achieved without either incineration or landfill. This is not true.</P>
    <P>The Government has a credible alternative to incineration in their complete package. Incineration is just one aspect of the waste management strategy. Do we have a credible and practical alternative to incineration as part of our waste management strategy? I do not believe so. The argument has been put forward that incineration will simply take over the strategy and all other elements will be cast aside. I accept the Minister of State's reassurances that that will not be the case. Our recycling targets will have to be attained. They cannot be set aside even when incinerators are up and running.</P>
    <P>The levy on plastic shopping bags will not be popular. Shoppers can be stressed at the checkout and for convenience and to avoid hassle they tend to use more and more plastic bags into which to pack their shopping. Packing their shopping can be frustrating at the end of a busy day in a supermarket. It will take a significant change of attitude to break that habit. This levy will help to make people think about what they are doing when they take more plastic bags. Unfortunately, <Col N="547" /> such a levy is inevitable if we are to deal with the big problem of plastic bags. If one drives down a boreen in any part of Ireland, one will see plastic bags strewn along the ditch, caught in briars. They can be seen on beaches, in parks and everywhere else, which is intolerable. I am glad the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is finally fulfilling his commitment to introduce a levy in the interest of the common good. There should be clarification in relation to different types of plastic bags. Shoppers in supermarkets may have to use 20 small plastic bags, whereas those shopping in clothes shops may arrive home with one big plastic bag. Is the levy the same for all plastic bags, regardless of size, quality and strength? A case can be made for different rates to meet different circumstances.</P>
    <P>Packaging is a problem, although I suggest that consumers do not have a choice in this regard. Shoppers buy what they have to buy, regardless of the amount of packaging with which it comes. We are told we should try to buy products that have as little packaging as possible, but that is not practical for stressed shoppers with a limited budget. The problem should be addressed at source by ensuring industrial and manufacturing organisations do not present their products with as much packaging. Imaginative efforts in this regard at national and EU level would go a long way towards tackling this serious problem.</P>
    <P>Local authorities in the greater Dublin area have done well to adopt a waste management plan with an overall objective of bringing about radical changes. Waste growth levels will be reduced, recycling will be increased, there will be more waste recovery and landfill will be minimised. Waste minimisation will be encouraged in co-operation with individuals, resident associations, communities and the private sector. Projects will include communal composting projects, home composting, green schools initiatives, public information and promotion campaigns and waste reduction targets. The Dublin waste management plan has as an objective the achievement of waste recycling and recovery rates by introducing home addressed collection of recyclables using green wheelie bins where possible, providing communal recycling facilities for multi-occupancy dwellings, four civic amenity sites, a bring bank for every 4,000 people, and separate collection for harmful household waste.</P>
    <P>Another overall objective of the plan is to introduce a wheelie bin refuse collection service, involving information programmes, distribution bins and the provision of a collection service. Biological waste will be recycled in two newly constructed biological treatment facilities. Thermal treatment of waste to enable energy recovery is another goal of this comprehensive programme. I disagree with Deputy Gilmore's comments as three wheelie bins will be delivered to every household in the Dublin Corporation area. Many households already have bins for both residual waste and dry recyclables and the third bin will <Col N="548" /> be used for organic waste. Household rubbish is now being segregated, as has been the case in Germany for many years, a major achievement that is better late than never.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's provisions in relation to litter, including the increase in on-the-spot fines to £100. It is generally recognised that there is a serious litter problem in the Dublin Corporation area and the suburbs of the city. The Lord Mayor of Dublin launched a major initiative in September 2000 to deal with it. Certain developments have exacerbated the litter problem, such as the advent of late night and Sunday shopping in the city centre and suburban villages. Household junk is indiscriminately dumped in laneways and other black spots. Litter bins are inadequately serviced at weekends and during and after major events. Many businesses do not take responsibility for cleaning the footpaths outside their premises.</P>
    <P>The city manager has come forward with a number of new proposals, including the reorganisation of street cleaning and significant investment in a new plant and equipment. There will be seven day cleaning of suburban villages and new wheelie bins will continue to be rolled out. A new junk collection service will be introduced, as will a system to tackle litter black spots such as laneways. A new level of general servicing will be complemented by the provision of 2,000 new litter bins and an increase in the number of litter wardens from 20 to 32. The enforcement role of litter wardens will be significantly enhanced and arrangements are under way to recruit the additional staff. It is a major programme and public awareness will be important if it is to be successful. Progress is being made and I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin will face a crisis of enormous proportions in the next 12 months, as the available landfill capacity is decreasing. Fingal County Council has increased its tonnage charge from £55 to £80 per tonne and requested commercial waste contractors to cut input by 50%. Notwithstanding these measures, there is an enormous crisis ahead. The process of establishing and developing a new landfill to permanently replace the existing facility in Balleally cannot happen in time to prevent an emergency. Domestic refuse in Dublin may go uncollected this time next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to force local authorities to adopt waste management plans, yet the Minister has failed to support the authorities which have adopted plans and are trying to ensure their delivery and implementation. The Government must ensure waste disposal facilities are in place to meet the commercial and domestic needs of the State. Local authorities must not be frustrated in the work of sourcing, surveying and developing <Col N="549" /> waste facilities. The Minister ought to introduce legislation which will allow local authorities to fast track the identification of necessary facilities and ensure their development without undue delay.</P>
    <P>Householders along with the commercial sector quite rightly expect that their homes or businesses should be serviced adequately with water, power, drainage and refuse collection and disposal. Small interest groups must not be allowed to abuse the best interests of the community in general. However, the Minister does not have any respect for democracy. He always opts for the spoiled child solution, to take the ball and run home rather than support democratically elected public representatives. Transferring power to the city or county manager is not the answer and it will be the cause of rancour and dissatisfaction within the authority and between it and the electorate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should approach the problem through the use of improved methods of operation and new technology together with encouraging the concept of community compensation packages that deliver a consensus on the way forward and reduce the level and intensity of objection. He is correct to take a percentage of the money generated from landfills and to use it to create an environmental fund. The more expensive the landfill option, the more economic reuse and recycling becomes. The State must be prepared to subsidise the market to allow for the development of a secure, viable recycling industry. Until that stability is created in the marketplace it will become very difficult to maximise reuse and recycling opportunities.</P>
    <P>The plastic bag levy is packaging with no content. If the Minister were serious he would have introduced a waste generator's tax which would have a real effect in reducing unnecessary refuse, and an environment audit which would examine each business and take account of all unnecessary packaging, promotional junk and so on so that the refuse created would be scarcer and a local tax imposed. That would apply to manufactures and retailers &ndash; two hits on the one generator of waste, which should appeal to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about the reduction of waste then it needs to do more than count empty plastic bags. It must capture the hearts and minds of citizens. We must change how society operates and sees itself. It is important waste management is recognised as a problem for the entire community and not only as an issue for those who reside or farm near a landfill site. The concept of removing plastic bags from the waste stream is a matter of litter management rather than landfill use.</P>
    <P>We are only too well aware in north Dublin about the time it takes for a bag to break down but ordinary people only see an old bag blowing around as a nuisance and they rightly wonder if it was ever worth it. We know only too well that plastic bags are not worth it nor will they ever <Col N="550" /> be considering the long-term damage which they cause. Plastic bags are for quick use but cause long-term damage with very little gain. We must view all waste in the same way. What did it ever contribute? If we want meaningful reduction, we should attack the source in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey mentioned wheelie bins. I am delighted Dublin Corporation has introduced free wheelie bins and the scheme should work. However, one must be conscious of the problem for those living in terraces. Residents have a problem using the bins in some areas because they cannot take them through the house and they wonder whether they should leave them outside. This issue must be examined but I welcome the separation process which should lead to less landfill waste.</P>
    <P>The committal to landfill of masonry and waste building materials is another widespread problem in Dublin. My family is engaged in the building supplies industry with the retail of gravel being the core element of the business. This material should be collected. The Minister should call all the interested parties together such as those who sell concrete and aggregates and put in place a system whereby such material can be brought to a site where it can be crushed and resold as gravel. If this content were taken out of landfill it would be a great service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cosgrave for sharing time. Modern society generates an increasing volume of domestic and industrial waste materials. The absence of suitable facilities for recycling, recovery, treatment and disposal of waste discourages the establishment of employment creating enterprises and reduces the quality of life of its citizens. The only method of dealing with solid waste material following recycling, recovery and treatment is disposal to landfill. There is an urgent need for the implementation of an integrated solid waste collection, treatment and disposal strategy. Very few landfills have a greater lifespan than ten or 12 years. The most critical problems regarding the disposal of solid waste are in Sligo, Galway, Enniskillen and Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>As regards tackling the serious problem of litter pollution, I share the Minister's commitment to reducing the use of plastic bags in shops. Business people have taken part in key initiatives to reduce litter in their local communities and are very supportive of Repak. Questions should be asked about Repak's role. Businesses contribute significant sums towards waste management and recycling on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any measures aimed at addressing the litter problem associated with plastic bags must be clear and unambiguous, operate on the polluter pays principle, which is not the case, be enforceable and effective, proportionate and not penalise certain categories of consumer or retailer, and be transparent and capable of review. Business people have a number of serious misgivings about the proposals in the Bill and believe they will be <Col N="551" /> unworkable and counterproductive. There is also an additional concern that the measures constitute an element of double taxation.</P>
    <P>The legislation, while well intended, is deficient in a number of important respects. It is vague and imprecise and key issues require clarification before enactment. Its proposals do not contain sufficient detail to allow business people to assess their impact and they do not address a number of key issues which are delegated to the Minister.</P>
    <P>To what types of plastic bags will the levy apply? Will it apply to the main shopping bag or will it include smaller plastic bags? When does the Minister propose to review the application of the levy? Will that take place after 12 or 24 months? How will retailers collect the levy? Will it be added to the grocery bill as a separate item? How will retailers account for and return the collected levy? What paperwork and administrative procedures will be applied and how will they operate? What class or classes of supermarkets, service stations or other outlets will be defined in the regulations to be made by the Minister? Will large retailers be able to absorb the cost of the levy for consumers directly or in conjunction with a loyalty card scheme?</P>
    <P>There is a significant difference between large and small businesses. Who will collect the levy from retailers, how often and what powers of collection and enforcement shall apply? What will happen when a consumer refuses to pay the levy? What exemptions will apply in regard to the levy and in what circumstances will refunds be paid? Will there be an exemption for specific classes of retailers and, if so, on what basis will any exemption be granted? What other types of articles does the Minister envisage will be brought within the scope of section 8(12)? Will retailers and consumers be subjected to the imposition of a levy for a range of other goods, products or services? What levy review process will be put in place and will the representatives of manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers be part of it? I am disappointed those people have not been consulted.</P>
    <P>The proposals for landfill tax also involve an element of double taxation for retailers. Retailers currently subscribe millions of pounds to Repak each year and this money is contributed towards recycling projects. What has it done with that money? We need compactors in every area. That is where Repak's money should be invested. It would be grossly unfair for retailers to be obliged to contribute to a landfill levy and contribute to Repak at the same time.</P>
    <P>Clarity on these issues is required before this part of the Bill can be enacted. The Minister should circulate the draft regulations he proposes to make when the Bill is enacted so that a meaningful debate can take place on the impact of this radical new legislation. The Minister is introducing this by the back door and it will not work because there are too many unanswered ques<Col N="552" /> tions. In the absence of draft regulations, any debate on the issue will take place in a vacuum. If further taxation is not imposed on business people and consumers, who can least afford to pay it, in a fair and equitable manner, it will be hard to implement. There should be greater transparency in this process and the key stakeholders should be consulted on the application and collection of the levy.</P>
    <P>I know business people who pay £250 a week to have skips removed from their car parks and they also pay Repak. Another tax will now be imposed on plastic bags. I know the concept is good but we must encourage people to use other forms of carrier bags if we want to take plastic bags out of the system. Will the Minister give a grant to business people who decide to use degradable shopping bags instead of plastic bags? I would prefer that because they are more expensive to buy. That would be one method of solving this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time with me. This Bill is like a dog that does not bark. The tail is wagging, but nothing is happening. The Minister has gone to the well but there is no water. He is only tampering with this issue, which is the most serious one facing this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry mentioned landfill sites. People will not accept them in their areas. That is the fault of the local authorities which did not adhere to the proper regulations for landfill sites. Incineration was put forward as an alternative. The Government should set up an independent body that would give an independent view on the health risks associated with incineration. Some months ago a public meeting was held in Longford which was attended by 500 or 600 people. People are genuinely afraid of incineration.</P>
      <P>It is outrageous to impose a levy on plastic bags. I grew up in a small country shop where everyone brought their own shopping bags. Anyone who came without them apologised profusely for forgetting them. They went home with their shopping on bicycles as there were not any big cars in those days. People did that voluntarily. However, this Government wants to introduce a divisive measure. It knows it must get the support of the people, particularly after last week.</P>

    <P>There is a great need for education in schools, etc. I had the pleasant duty last week of being present in Tashinny school in County Longford which was awarded a green flag. It was obvious that all the children were motivated about recycling. Such initiatives should be supported. People involved in the recycling business want to <Col N="553" /> be in it, but they cannot make money. If the Government is serious about tackling this problem it should introduce incentives such as grants for people in the recycling business. We all agree that recycling is the answer, but when funding and incentives are not provided people will not get involved in the business. There is nothing positive in this Bill. It is a divisive measure which will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that section 4 &ldquo;provides that the making of a waste management plan will become an Executive function. Where a local authority manager considers that a waste management plan is invalid because the purported decision of the relevant authority was subject to qualification, the manager will adopt the said plan&rdquo;. Why does he not shut down county councils? What is the purpose of having a ballot box? Why should we elect members? Why should we go to the trouble of having local authorities? It should all be given to the manager. This statement was made by the Fianna Fáil Party which purports to represent the small person and whose history dictates that the people must have their say at the ballot box. Yet in one fell swoop the county manager will be the boss and we can scrap the councillors and bury the ballot box. That is Fianna Fáil's answer to it.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State said, most local authorities have adopted plans as required under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to address the mounting waste problem. Most people would consider the Minister of State's figures, which show a growth in waste of 3% to 4% per annum, as not only conservative but a fraction of the real growth in this area. Unfortunately, this area of growth is doing considerable damage and it will be expensive to deal with it. The 1996 Act went a considerable way towards dealing with this problem. I remember many people were critical of it and said that it went too far in some respects.</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged that many local authorities have faced up to their responsibilities. It is less than fair to be overly critical of those who have not because they were faced with difficulties which they might not have been able to address in the short term. As the Minister of State said, it is an issue we cannot wait to resolve and which requires this legislation to move it a step further. There are many reasons the few local authorities that have not implemented the 1996 legislation have been unable to do so. Perhaps some of them are waiting for a magic wand solution or for a way to get off the hook. Although they will rail against it, many of them will welcome the provision that gets them off the hook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small minority of members of most councils, as is the case in the Dáil, pretend there is an easy and aesthetically pleasing way to address the <Col N="554" /> problem. Most of them know there is not, but there are constituencies receptive to the view and the posturing in this regard that are ready to believe the fairy tale that we can continue to ignore this problem and that it will magically go away. That will not and cannot happen. The problem has disimproved dramatically. The nation is producing mountains of waste, about 90% of which currently goes into landfill. That is not sustainable in the short to medium term. Many landfills are reaching the end of their useful lives. Many of the small landfills could not be and were not adequately policed over many years. I have no doubt that it was possible to dump dangerous and perhaps toxic substances in them. There was a danger to water courses in some areas and, in some cases, a danger to public water supplies. The need to address that issue is equally as important as the need to address the growing waste mountain.</P>
    <P>The country needs efficient and cost-effective waste services and infrastructure. We have been slow to develop comprehensive and modern strategies. Strategic planning is fundamental to good waste management and that was recognised in the 1996 Act. There were sufficient provisions in that legislation had been taken seriously and acted upon quickly to make the current legislation unnecessary but that did not happen because people did not have the capacity or feel the urgency to face up to reality.</P>
    <P>We have a limited recycling infrastructure. Effectively we do not have any means of energy recovery from waste and no biological treatment capacity to any extent. We have to face up to the fact that the provision of a good waste recycling infrastructure will be enormously costly. We have moved along in the belief that, somehow or other, recycling can be a self-financing operation but that is impossible. If we are to have a recycling infrastructure it will have to be paid for and the sad reality is that a good deal of the cost in the short to medium term will have to be picked up by the State. I welcome the provision regarding the environmental fund arising from the levies. That fund can grow dramatically and fund the type of recycling we need.</P>
    <P>Individuals and groups in various parts of the country engaged in waste recycling to a greater or lesser extent sought the support of local authorities and central Government and have been disappointed by the lack of response to their proposals. Some very good proposals were put forward. There was one in my own county and the people involved battled for a long time with little support. Those of us who realised that what they were doing would ultimately be very useful were embarrassed at the failure of the authorities at local and national level to give the type of support required to their initiative. Separating various kinds of recyclable materials from materials which are no longer of use is difficult and tedious work, and it is by no means glamorous. We need to put in place these kind of facilities in many <Col N="555" /> more locations and we have to face up to the fact that they will need substantial grant aid.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers complained bitterly about the proposed levy on plastic shopping bags which could increase, under the Bill, to a maximum of 15p per bag. Anybody who sees waste in the countryside, in particular, and to a certain extent in the towns, will realise that plastic bags are among the greatest offenders in terms of visible rubbish. Equally as damaging is the fact that if and when they are consigned to waste management facilities, or to landfill sites in particular, they are not readily biodegradable and have a very long life. Neither are they environmentally friendly in terms of dioxin emissions if they should be submitted for thermal treatment, which is one of the other options.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to introduce such a measure at this time. It will bring home to every individual that they have a responsibility to play their part in reducing the enormous waste mountain which is creating such difficulty. Nothing will bring home that message to people more than the fact that using plastic bags will cost them a substantial percentage of the cost of their shopping. People will learn quickly to find other means of transporting goods. That is one of the measures that will have a dramatic and fairly quick effect.</P>
    <P>There is also a proposed landfill levy of £15 per tonne. That may appear modest but I understand in terms of cost per load it is quite a large amount. It will have the effect of making landfill less attractive. I hope it will not have the short-term effect of tempting even more people to resort to dumping material in public places, beauty spots or inaccessible areas where they think they cannot be seen. That is an area in which we need to take much stronger action. The £100 on the spot fine for dumping is derisory if it is taken in the context of dumping the contents of the boot of a car or a trailer of plastic bags and other materials in a particular beauty spot, on a piece of bog land or wherever people tend to dump these items. Perhaps a £100 fine is more in order if somebody threw a small piece of paper on a street, but that does not adequately address the enormity of the difficulty we are facing. There might be justification for a modest fine for a minor littering offence but I would support a much larger fine in the case of dumping bags of rubbish in the types of places to which I have referred. As a previous speaker said, the people who are doing this are not poor or those we would consider to be less informed about this issue. It is pillars of society who are dumping their rubbish in various places and that problem has to be addressed in the short term.</P>
    <P>One of the measures I would like to see introduced to deal with this problem is compulsory community service for people caught either littering or dumping. I might draw a slight distinction in that regard, but it is something that should be taken account of because that would put a certain emphasis on the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> We must dramatically increase awareness of this problem and use many more &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; type measures. We must also use the stick much more than we have in the past. Extensive advertising campaigns have been run which appear to have had virtually no positive effect. Perhaps I am judging them a little harshly, and I look forward to being proven wrong with some of the future campaigns. It is difficult to believe that we need to mount major advertising campaigns, with various fines and so on, to force people to face up to the fact that they are doing such damage. That is particularly difficult to understand in a country which is hugely dependent on tourism and needs a clean environment to enjoy a high quality of life. Newsprint, of which there is a large amount, is a difficult product with which to deal. It should be possible to devise a system to ensure that used newspapers are transported. It has been suggested that this could be done by the vehicles which deliver them in the first instance. This is a specialist service which could easily collect wrapped bundles of old newspapers when making deliveries. It might be possible to introduce a pilot scheme in this regard which would adopt more of the carrot approach and less of the stick.</P>
    <P>The option of a national waste management authority was examined. This would be a less democratic option than that provided for under the 1996 Act and envisaged under the powers provided for county managers in this Bill. However, the problem is so serious that we may have to examine the possibility of establishing such an authority with significant powers to deal with the problems which beset us at present.</P>
    <P>We also need to face up to the fact that in areas where people object to the opening of landfill sites, local authorities have traditionally managed such sites very poorly. For many years there was a problem with a lack of resources. Those who served on local authorities tried to ensure that whatever money was available was put to the best use, usually trying to deal with the problems of potholes. However, there is no doubt that local authorities starved the area of waste management of resources. The dumps with which I am familiar frequently allowed large amounts of litter to flutter around the countryside for miles and no respect was shown for neighbours.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one case in which the argument was made that the dump existed before most of the houses in the area were built and that those who bought cheap sites should have known about, and been prepared for, the problem with the dump. To some extent this was used as an excuse for not addressing the problems which existed in that area. This was not good enough.</P>
    <P>Even within the constraints on financial resources, no serious attempt was made during the past 20 years to manage many landfill sites. Almost all the difficulties and objections which now exist, particularly regarding new landfill sites, stem from people's appalling experiences of such sites in the past 20 years. The experience in Clare was that the civic amenity sites which were <Col N="557" /> provided to replace closed dumps were also objected to and met a frosty welcome. In fairness to Clare County Council, it has managed its civic amenity sites very well. These sites are tidy and there is no waste outside them or plastic bags fluttering around. Everything is under control and those who live nearby would confirm they are hardly aware there is a waste collection facility next door.</P>
    <P>One company in County Clare tried to provide an incinerator, but ran into a high level of objections. What was extraordinary was that the proposed situation post-incineration had the capacity to reduce the level of dangerous and doubtful emissions by more than 90%. This facility is now up and running and, according to EPA figures, it has reduced the level of dioxins and other emissions by 96%. However, there was a campaign against this facility and a fear of dioxins and other issues about which it was difficult to reassure people in the two or three year campaign leading up to the opening of the facility.</P>
    <P>People were concerned that there has been a cavalier attitude from industry and local authorities over many years. For a long time the protection of jobs and the creation of employment were given such a high priority that people were prepared to turn a blind eye to behaviour by industrialists and others which was less than desirable or necessary. We have come a long way since then and we have to face up to the fact that in many cases where industry has provided thermal treatment &ndash; usually incineration &ndash; it has been successful and has reduced the level of waste considerably.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to threatened EU action against the State. People are often critical of the EU and its institutions, sometimes with good reason. However, this is one area in which such intervention will have a positive effect and has to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>If we are proactive in the EU, in most cases the benefits far outweigh whatever shortcomings there may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also need to be aware of the experience in continental Europe regarding new innovations and waste treatment methods. Some of my former colleagues on Clare County Council visited a facility in Germany which was hailed as the new messiah, but which has since been closed as it was not successful. When moving into the area of innovative facilities we must ensure they have been tried and tested successfully. With the exception of Dublin, there is a difficulty in that the levels of waste which are likely to go to the <Col N="558" /> regional centres may not be enough to justify the costs or to ensure the efficient running of the kinds of facilities which may be considered at this stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister made considerable reference to the need for waste minimisation. The plastic bag levy is a move in the right direction in this regard. It is cheaper to minimise the level of waste than to recycle it or to deal with goods which are non-recyclable.</P>
    <P>The segregation, reuse and recovery of waste is an area in which we have not made much progress, but which we will have to address. This Bill will make it easier to address this issue and we are facing up to the fact that it is going to take a large amount of financial resources to deal with this issue. The October 1998 policy statement entitled Changing Our Ways set out some of what is required in this regard, but we have made little progress since. One lesson we have learned is that it is difficult to change our ways and we find it difficult to do so. In fairness to local authorities, which have been tardy in addressing the requirements under the 1996 Act, they have faced what they have seen as insurmountable or significant difficulties. They have to deal with the fact that people have a fear of incinerators, dioxins and anything which might arise from such a process. If people want landfill sites they would wish them to be located as far away as possible. This is mainly due to experience over the years. We have a target for recycling or biologically treating 40% or 50% of our waste, but we will need to meet a higher target. I wish the Minister well with this legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The hallmark of this Government has been its inability to provide public services and to effectively deal with the demands of a growing economy and of the public for quality public services. This applies to health, education and housing. Citizens know that in a time of unprecedented economic success, their access to services is deteriorating. Research shows that inequality is growing despite the money available to the Minister for Finance in his budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate concerns waste management and how to put in place an effective waste management system. Never has it been clearer that the Government is unable to take the decisions required to progress waste management plans. A couple of weeks after the Nice treaty was rejected, and with so much talk about the democratic deficit, the fact that people were not consulted and the need to explain and educate the public, it is ironic that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has introduced a Bill that will bypass local communities, local authority members and other elected representatives. <Col N="559" /> Why is this? It is because he has not had enough consultation and cannot reach agreement. Therefore, he is going to railroad the legislation through the House and deal with what he calls &ldquo;obstacles&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Clune, dealt comprehensively with this matter in her opening address. She asked what the obstacles are &ndash; they are the community and the local councillors. The time is past when one can impose this sort of legislation on people. Even if the Bill is passed, there will be a reaction from the public who want to be consulted on waste management issues. They will insist on it. We will have to give them detailed information and inform them of the consequences of the various options, as well as involving them in the decision. If we do not we will have serious environmental problems all over the country.</P>
    <P>We will certainly have them in Ringsend in my constituency because it is not feasible to impose an incineration plant in that area. It is not feasible to introduce incineration in this country as we have done so little work on recycling and have given so little information to the public about it. We have not provided an infrastructure to deal with recycling. Earthwatch issued a press release today stating that the Waste Management (Amendment) (No 2) Bill introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is incompatible with the three R's, reduction, reuse and recycling. Earthwatch said the legislation does not pay enough attention to them.</P>
    <P>The modern, state-of-the-art waste to energy incinerator is a sophisticated answer to the wrong question. The task is not to find a new place to put the waste, the real task is to find ways to unmake waste. Instead of spending billions of euros trying to perfect the destruction of our discarded materials we should be putting our efforts into recovering them. That summarises how we should approach the waste issue, and it is the real task the Government should have addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have a 3% recycling rate which is the lowest in Europe. The Bill should have dealt with the waste issue by including comprehensive measures to introduce educational initiatives, awareness programmes and more funding. That would have ensured that recycling takes off. We do not have the infrastructure for recycling. What is the Minister doing about that? Why are some companies importing recycled plastic bottles when millions of plastic bottles are being collected here? What is happening to the segregated waste that is being collected at present? It is being exported because there is no facility to deal with it here.</P>
    <P>The key task concerning waste management is to provide a basic infrastructure for recycling but why are no such facilities available? The Bill does nothing to develop an adequate recycling industry. We have a democratic deficit wherein power is taken away from local communities and councillors at a time when the public has shown, <Col N="560" /> through the vote against Nice, that it wants to be involved in decision making. To this end, the public wants to be provided with high quality information.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes a minimalist approach to recycling. I welcome the provision for an environmental fund but the Minister should examine the suggestions made by An Taisce concerning how the fund is managed and employed. An Taisce has suggested some very worthwhile amendments which should be taken into consideration. For its part, Fine Gael has suggested the creation of a national waste management authority which, together with local authorities and councillors, could work out what is needed for the country as a whole. Why do we have proposals for five incinerators? Before any decision is made about an incinerator we should have an analysis of the health risks. We need detailed information about the health aspects of the incineration process.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the waste crisis that will confront Dublin, probably in a couple of weeks. The streets of Dublin will be littered with waste shortly because there is a serious problem facing the country, particularly the capital. This week, the IBEC said that waste disposal for commercial and business premises in the Dublin area could reach crisis point soon. This is because contractors have been restricted on the quantities of waste allowed to be used as landfill at Balleally Dublin could face the same situation as Galway did a few months ago, with bags of refuse lying uncollected on the streets. This is because of obvious gaps in the provision of the necessary waste infrastructure. It is clear that we are approaching a crisis. A task force is needed immediately to deal with the waste problem in Dublin and to consider a range of alternatives. I am sorry to say that the Bill misses the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill. As a constituency colleague of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, I wish him well and hope that he will be back among us soon to hear what we have to say about these issues. In real terms, the main purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal mechanism to bring the current waste management planning process to an early and satisfactory conclusion. According to the Government, the only way to do that is to give county mangers the power to override local authority members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meath County Council agreed to a waste management strategy, in conjunction with other counties, on the basis that a dump would be provided. One of those counties failed to agree to the strategy. We made a decision on that two years ago but with the proviso that the dump would take only 60,000 tonnes of waste annually. The county council applied for a licence for the dump and received approval for a rate of 62,000 tonnes of waste per year. Celtic Waste Limited has applied for permission to build the landfill at Knockharley in Kentstown which is in the eastern part of County Meath. The company has sought per<Col N="561" /> mission to accept 180,000 tonnes of waste. Why is this the case? Neither I nor my colleagues was made aware of this plan. We voted for something but this development was not on the table. It represents a sleight of hand by a number of people and I am totally opposed to the proposal. County Meath produces about 50,000 or 60,000 tonnes of waste a year, yet we are being asked to take waste from the north Leinster region. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity of visiting a number of incinerator plants. We were told many things concerning why such a plant would be good for an area in dealing with waste problems but we were not told about a number of other issues. We were not told about the emissions which can, and will, cause serious problems. We were told that the ash produced by the incinerator would be great for building roads but they did not tell us that if it became wet it would corrode the surrounding area until it disintegrated. These facts are enough for each of us in the House to say that incineration is not for us because that particular type of waste cannot be dealt with in this country.</P>
    <P>The eastern part of the county that I represent should not be turned into a waste pit with a dump that will be three times the size of the one proposed and an incinerator beside Carranstown, near Duleek, County Meath. There is a proposal for eight incinerators in this Bill yet there is not one proposal that deals with recycling and reuse. I visited a 150 acre reuse plant in America that is one of the biggest in the world. The material is brought in and sorted into different categories for reuse. An individual connected with this plant visited the Department of the Environment and Local Government with the intention of getting involved in recycling and reuse in Ireland. After 15 minutes in the Department he threw his hands up in the air and said that he was in the wrong place as no-one understood what he was trying to do. That was ten years ago. Imagine what changes would have been made if he had been listened to and something positive had been done.</P>
    <P>In Dublin people are being provided with bins. Why are we not providing them with bunkers for material that can be turned into phosphates? We have more money than ever before and so have an opportunity to provide every household with green bins. The Government has failed on this issue.</P>
    <P>We are facing a serious problem where power is being given to local authority managers. Let us imagine what would happen if even half of the local authority managers were like George Redmond. We would have dumps and incinerators everywhere. I do not believe that this Parliament should pass an Act taking powers away from locally elected members. Power should not be given to people who are appointed by Government. It is not right. It is a retrograde step for which this Government will pay a price.</P>
    <P>The east coast has suffered as a result of Sellafield, and Meath more so than anywhere else. The part of Cavan I come from has had its share of <Col N="562" /> fatalities from cancer. This is the type of problem which incineration may cause and there is no evidence to say that it will not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on this subject. Waste management has become a major issue in the mid-west region with the recent refusal of permission by Kerry County Council to Clare County Council to use the Muingnaminnane landfill site. This was done for a number of reasons, principally because Clare county councillors did not make a decision to provide their own landfill site in County Clare. When we made the decision about seven years ago it was a very unpopular one, and now we want to protect our dump. I do not think regional plans will work. They did not in the case of Clare, Limerick and Kerry. Each county should have its own landfill site and look after it properly.</P>
      <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that waste management remains one of the most challenging areas of modern environmental management. The latest figures show that quantities are continuing to grow &ndash; almost 18 million tonnes of waste were generated in 1998. That demonstrates that landfill is the only solution at this time.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s there was a very good paper recycling project in Tralee, County Kerry, which was well supported. It did not succeed because it did not get enough financial support. As far as I see we are going backwards. There are a few innovative projects operating in Kerry. The Brandon Hotel has a composting project and in Tralee there is a two bin system whereby residents put biodegradable material in one and material for landfill in the other. That is working quite well but overall there is no clear progress being made nationally regarding recycling or composting.</P>
      <P>The money that has been spent on education and information does not appear to have worked, because when one looks around we are a filthy nation. When people visit the country they comment on the amount of litter strewn about. Many of our villages are currently very clean as they are preparing for the tidy towns competition. A major effort has been made by volunteers picking up papers. I have seen them over the past few days as they await the arrival of the assessors. Unfortunately, they cannot maintain this effort all year and if one goes back to the same place at another time it is strewn with litter. They are not prepared to go out and pick up litter thrown about by irresponsible people who are not mindful of the fact that they are damaging the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a major problem and this Bill is a fudge. I cannot imagine why the Minister has given over this function to county managers. Why does he not keep the responsibility himself? Would that not have been more prudent than asking the county manager to do it if councillors were not prepared in some instances to bite the bullet? Why did he not keep it as something that he could do by regulation? Why pass it on to the county manager who will come under consider<Col N="563" /> able pressure not only from local representatives but also from the community? County managers will be the target now, and I do not think they will like this provision. It is putting too much responsibility on their shoulders and will prove difficult for many of them.</P>
    <P>It is important that scientific research on the dangers of incineration be made available. An expert from Holland who spoke at a major conference in Dublin said that what comes out of incinerators is the product of what is put into it. If clean or non-hazardous waste goes into incinerators then dioxins will not be produced. I was in Tokyo with a parliamentary delegation last year where we learned that they have 11 incinerators and a recycling system operating in conjunction with this. They are very environmentally conscious and it seems to be working very well. Waste management will not go away and, just as with health, we will have to face up to the issue. People are sick to death of looking at report after report and public initiative after public initiative with no resulting action, which at this stage we need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity this Bill provides to debate its content, the issue of waste management and how the State and our local authorities should deal with it. I hope Committee and Report Stages will be slow and that the Members who have to tease out the detail of the Bill will have the opportunity to examine every aspect and concept and deliberate upon them before a final decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are rushing into this without examining all the issues. We are not examining the issues surrounding recycling and the current activities of local authorities. Kilkenny County Council adopted its plan and worked with the various interest groups both for and against incineration and formulated a plan which was acceptable to all. The plan included a commitment to revisit the issue of incineration and other concepts as they were better developed, having looked at practices in different states like our own. That was a sensible approach. Having served on the local authority for a number of years, I do not see any real action in relation to recycling, segregation, composting and the other concepts discussed here. If one looks around most urban centres, there are token gestures on all these issues. The community is very supportive of protecting the environment, recycling and aiming at having zero waste. We must have that aim. Local authorities simply do not have the staff, time or money to put in place the policies that would bring on board their communities as far as recycling and the greener approach is concerned. We should ensure local authorities have the money, giving them the space and time to put their policies in place to minimise the amount of rubbish left over to go to landfill. Were that to happen, we would dramatically reduce the amount of rubbish ending up in our <Col N="564" /> landfill dumps. However, the infrastructure to do that is not in place.</P>
    <P>We do not even have the facility to shred plastic containers, though it is available on this island. Local authorities have not accessed that type of infrastructure to deal with their problems. There is not enough focus within local authorities to deal with the problem in a comprehensive and real way, even though people are willing to co-operate in any imaginative scheme with which local authorities or the Government can come up. They will co-operate once we stay away from their greatest fear which is incineration, which they do not want because they believe that one has to feed the incineration process with a particular tonnage of rubbish to make the project feasible. There is enough evidence to encourage the community, the Government and local government to examine that notion further to allay the fears of the public or find a safer process. We must protect at all costs the green image this country has at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased local authorities have interacted with schools and was present, as were other Deputies in their constituencies, at the raising of the green flag at the Kilkenny school project. The young pupils had participated fully in all the activities leading to the achievement of the green flag and it was a great lesson for me to see it working on the ground. They were fully aware of segregation, recycling and the processes that involved, the need to extend it to the wider community and the fact that there was support for such a process. They were also involved in composting and understood the scope it provided for recycling and the greener environment. As with information technology, those young pupils were taking the message home and ensuring their parents were aware of what can be done to protect the environment. Parents, the board of management and pupils came together in that school and presented what can only be described as a wonderful, successful project. It could be used as a model by any other school and was a source of great information for all of us, public representatives and parents, who attended that function. Kilkenny County Council played a huge role through its litter warden, who interacted with the schools. He visits 50 or 60 schools on a regular basis. That is an essential part of the education process which must take place within our communities if we are to be successful.</P>
    <P>One of the key issues in the Bill is the further reduction of the powers of local government members. We took on the responsibility of providing our county council with a plan and the onus was on every other county to do likewise. If not, the public representatives elected at local authority level failed their constituents and that is how it should be seen. If they are going to be part of local government, the onus is on them to take responsibility. That can sometimes be very difficult, particularly with waste management. I want to give an example of how democracy does not serve us, as public representatives in this case, <Col N="565" /> and the people we represent at local government or national level. I give the example of the development of Powerstown dump in Carlow about which the community was deeply concerned. The original agreement to locate the dump there was based on the land being later handed back to the farmer concerned, level and with green grass on it. That was the picture created ten or 15 years ago. To this day, driving along the main road one can see it rising towards the sky and they are to extend it further. It has polluted the ground water in the area to the extent that its immediate neighbours have not had water for several years. Their water supply is carried to their houses by bucket. A business in the area was closed down simply because the dump did not work. The litter was everywhere, the birds on the dump were uncontrolled and it created an environmental hazard.</P>
    <P>The lady in question brought a court case and won but the local authority refused to stand by the court's ruling and is currently in breach of European regulations. What has the Department of the Environment and Local Government done in that case? I have tabled a parliamentary question on it, raised it on the Adjournment and on other occasions in this House when I was ruled out of order. I tried to raise it at local authority level but could not. What value am I, as a public representative, elected by the people, in that case? Is it surprising that people are cynical of the whole political process?</P>
    <P>Neither did I get a response from the Department. It was all sent to the EPA, which is absolutely unacceptable. The rights of those living in the area have been taken away and they have been left without representation and with only the courts to go to. How many people can afford to go to the courts and why, morally, should they have to do so? If the local authority is for the people, should it not represent those people and respond to them instead of putting them to one side and letting them suffer because it does not have the money to deal with this?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State and the officials to take what I have said on board, to investigate that dump and ensure that the rights of that community are upheld. I fail to see why that action cannot be taken, why my representations were largely overlooked and why those people still suffer. How has a local authority, under the Department of the Environment and Local Government, been allowed to breach those regulations and carry on as if those people did not exist? I await the Minister of State's reply. I have given enough information and I am asking for an investigation to take place.</P>
    <P>If this happens in a local authority, given our limited power, I hate to think of what may happen when we give power to the county managers. I do not like that process, as I have seen people's rights taken away and the strength of local democracy constantly weakened.</P>
    <P>We talk constantly about giving powers to local <Col N="566" /> authorities but the Bill contains a gate charge per ton of rubbish paid to a national fund. We are only beginning the process of charging people per ton for what is collected from their doors and that has resulted in a huge increase in the cost of dumping charges. In December local authorities will add anything from 50% to 100% to that, while we are looking here at adding further charges at the tiphead. That is an unfair system of taxation, as people are only becoming aware of the cost involved here.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are not making the effort we should in relation to composting, recycling and segregation, which I mentioned earlier. Neither have we learned from what has happened abroad, though I was not one of those who went to foreign lands to see what incineration was like. How many counties sent people away to find out what recycling, zero waste or an economy which controlled its waste by way of greener policies was like? Not many. We are going down the road of incineration without examining the facts of recycling fully. We are not allowing for the great energy and willingness to participate among communities if the policies are right. Communities would participate but they do not have the infrastructure at present to make the powerful contribution they are capable of.</P>
    <P>There should be an onus on each county to devise methods to deal with its waste. Every region will be different &ndash; Dublin would be vastly different in terms of tonnage, demand and policing breaches from the south-east. Different areas will emphasise different matters, depending on their industries, therefore, each county and region will need different policies. While giving powers to local authorities, a separate fund should be provided to local authorities each year to enable them to develop concepts which are environmentally friendly. We saw the huge reduction in tonnage going to the dumps when building material was taken out and recycled properly. It can be done but we do not seem to have the willingness on our side to do so. I refer to a willingness on the side of public representatives and politicians, as that willingness exists among the greater community. We have simply not fed into it. We all want to protect our environment. I served on a council for 22 years and during those years there was not perhaps enough emphasis on what should have been done &ndash; we were not as aware as we might have been or perhaps with the economy in a different state we had different priorities. That does not mean we cannot put our hands up now and say we are willing to learn, to correct some of those mistakes and to bring communities on board with new, imaginative policies that are environmentally friendly.</P>
    <P>There are great fears about incineration. I have seen public meetings all over the country where people from outside the State have come in to advise local communities. Those people were not raising unnecessary fears, they were informing communities which, to illustrate the energy I referred to earlier, were willing to be informed <Col N="567" /> and to make a change for the better. Those communities are looking to us for leadership but I do not see too much leadership in the Bill, which is why I hope we will have the opportunity to debate it fully and change it where necessary. That will be vital for the success of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have had submissions from the Camphill Communities of Ireland based in Carrick-on-Suir and the waste study group based in Slieve Rua in Kilkenny. All of them deal with issues relative to the Bill but in each case they seek a return to local democracy and they ask for an opportunity to participate in the democratic process which would lead to community support for environmentally friendly action on waste management. We can reduce the tonnage going to the dumps and then we could deal with what is left in a different way than incineration. Some local authorities have asked for an extension on their dumps to cover the five year period. Powerstown is one dump which has breached every regulation, yet it wants to extend.</P>
    <P>What will we do about the extension of that dump? Surely within five years we can reduce that tonnage and then we can look at the new concepts to deal with the balance of the waste. There is no need to rush into this. There are enough technological concepts for us to examine during this period so that when the five years are up we are not embarking on a new course but simply taking on board what is happening in the world around us and making the appropriate changes.</P>
    <P>We must do something. This Bill affords us the chance to debate fully the issues concerned. However, the community is more than willing to participate. All we have to do is listen and bring forward the proposals which all of us across the political spectrum are anxious to buy into to find a resolution to this problem.</P>

      <P>I am sharing time with Deputy D'Arcy &ndash; agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le Fine Gael as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt &ndash; contained within this Waste Management (Amendment) No. 2 Bill, 2001. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, will oppose in any way possible the Government charter for landfill and incinerator developers contained in the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2001. Historians will look back in astonishment at this Dáil and note that last week the Government argued to sell off the national airline to any investor with a couple of million pounds to spare. This week, in a bid to annex more sovereignty and democratic accountability, the latest waste Bill is being introduced to turn county and city managers into landlords akin to their 18th and 19th century predecessors. The city or county manager is to be offered power to override the views of the community, local businesses, farmers and the elected representatives of the people, and to decide when and where a landfill or incinerator is to be built, and how big it is to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> Although ecological experts elsewhere in the world are showing that zero waste strategies exist which remove the need for mixed landfills and incinerators, ironically, it is other post-colonial English-speaking countries such as New Zealand, Australia and Canada that are implementing, with increasing success, zero waste strategies. Is it not a disgrace that this Government is intent on handing back the waste management of this country to overseas developers while Irish people who have made their homes in the New World are consulting with their communities to enforce a waste strategy that does away with the most primitive options on the waste hierarchy, i.e. thermal treatment and mixed landfill?</P>
    <P>Last Sunday I met the Australian ambassador to Ireland who is rightly proud of cities such as Canberra where the waste plan is called &ldquo;Zero Waste by 2010 AD&rdquo;. This means that no waste will go to landfill after 2010. In New Zealand, over 74 local authorities have given a commitment to reduce waste to zero by 2015. New Zealand has decided not to introduce incineration to protect the health of its people, environment and important food industry.</P>
    <P>This Friday, I am meeting the Canadian ambassador and a parliamentary delegation from the Canadian parliament. Nova Scotia has been mentioned as a good role model and the Minister has visited that area. I want to discuss the success of the waste reduction systems in Quelph, Ontario, where all waste is separated into just two categories at source &ndash; wet or compostable waste and dry or recyclable waste. If a material does not fit into either category, then good government would ban it or make it so expensive as to make the recyclable alternative more attractive.</P>
    <P>The first lesson for Ireland from Quelph is that there is no third bin for residual waste. In this way, all waste is sorted and baled as a raw material for re-use or else composted if it is organic in origin. As with many businesses, the market for recycled material is cyclical. If the material needs to be sorted until the price for its sale improves, then let it be stored. Storage is very different from landfill as the material is available to be re-used. If it cannot be re-used, then the job of good government is to prevent such waste being created in the first place. Such powers are contained in the Waste Management Act, 1996, and they allow the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to provide for all or any of the following matters which include specifying design of packaging, prohibiting, limiting or controlling in a specified manner and to a specified extent containers or other packaging, or any product or substance.</P>
    <P>Another lesson from Quelph relates to their rejection of wheelie bins. The Quelph preference was and is for transparent bags which could be recycled. The wet waste goes into a green tinted bag and the dry waste into a blue tinted bag. This helps detection of contamination in either waste stream as the contents of each bag can be <Col N="569" /> inspected before collection. Putting the wrong material in the wrong bag or bin is the same as littering. In Quelph, if waste is mixed, it is handed back to be sorted out first before it can be collected.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has given up on reducing waste. Waste has doubled in the past four years. He has given up on prohibiting waste generation. He sat back as Glanbia closed two milk bottling plants in Dublin. He has dragged his heels on removing all green waste and all construction and demolition waste from landfill. With this Bill, he has finally turned his back on the people and their local representatives by rejecting their alternative plans, many of which are already being successfully implemented in other countries. &ldquo;The People's Plan&rdquo; was drafted by people in the Galway area. It gives figures and a lot more detail than the official plan for Connacht drafted by M. C. O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>This Government needs to take stock of the reasons the waste crisis has grown so seriously under its watch. Like the Government, the Green Party identifies problems with section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996. Section 22 allows local authorities not to make a plan for their own area. Instead, they can throw their lot in with other areas, employ a consultant and have a regional plan of which their area is but a part. In this way waste is not properly quantified, costs are left vague or unmentioned and in the end facilities are sought in the least politically sensitive locations. The result is not to reduce or manage waste but to hide it.</P>
    <P>In place of this, the Minister can only think of exterminating local democracy. The Green Party's amendment to section would return accountability to each individual, town and county and, for materials needing regional treatment, to each region. The amendment which we will seek to table states:</P>
    <P>Each local authority shall make a waste management plan. This plan should clearly indicate the processes of import and export of all waste from the local authorities' functional area. Where there is a transfer of waste from one local authority area to another, this shall be clearly indicated in each plan. Each local authority plan shall clearly indicate quantities and types of waste produced, quantities and types of waste dealt with within its area,</P>
    <P>and so forth. What we propose involves accountability, traceability and ultimately responsibility.</P>
    <P>In the end, the courts may well decide the fate of this Government's out of sight, out of mind waste strategy. Last Thursday in Balbriggan Court, residents of Loughbarn, the Tooman, Annsbrook, Brownstown and Palmerstown, which were ear-marked for a landfill in the market garden area of north County Dublin, won their case against Fingal County Council. The court found it unlawful for Fingal County Council or its agents to enter land to carry out tests on <Col N="570" /> sites which were not yet selected as definite landfill sites. The judge also condemned the tendency of the county manager not to meet or consult local residents and community groups. The judge condemned the type of agenda which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is pushing.</P>
    <P>In its policy, this Government is not just being dictatorial, it is being dangerous. The health of people living near landfills and incinerators suffers. In a study in 1987 the stature of children near a landfill was found to be affected. In 1990, a study of Californian children found that there were low birth rates. In Hamilton, Ontario, another study pointed to bronchitis, skin rashes, arthritis, lethargy and depression being the result of living near landfills. In June 1999 in Ballinasloe in Galway, five doctors cited health risks from living near landfill. In areas near incinerators, which are proven sources of dioxins in a country with a low dioxin level, it is clear that babies being breast fed are the hardest hit by dioxin poisoning. This Government must answer people such as Dr. Gunilla Lindstrom, a Swedish chemist who measured dioxin levels in her own breast milk as she suckled her first child. The levels of dioxin in her body fell by 15% per month over the first six months. Her baby had literally sucked the poison out of her. I appeal to the Government not to suck the life out of this country and to reject this charter for incinerator and landfill construction. We need sound ecological and sustainable measures to solve the waste crisis. We do not need dumps and incinerators, provision and construction of which will make certain multinationals and developers rich and, ultimately, the people and the environment extremely sick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate on refuse and waste management. Some people may believe that refuse is a problem for local authorities, but it is a problem which every individual in the State should consider. The sooner we can put that message across to members of the public the better.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points, the first of which relates to people's carelessness. I represent a county with a strong tourism industry and its inhabitants welcome the fact that so many of their Dublin cousins holiday there. However, we are not enamoured of those who leave bags of rubbish along the sides of roads throughout the county. This is an extremely bad habit. There have been a number of successful prosecutions in respect of such dumping because those responsible neglected to remove letters addressed to them from their rubbish and their identities were discovered as a result. However, people have become wise to this and when illegally dumped bags of rubbish are opened now they do not contain such letters. As a result, there is no evidence to allow a case to be brought. I appeal to people not to dump rubbish on the roads of Counties Wexford and Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Many people returning at night from their local public houses and other establishments often visit the local chip shop and buy a bag of chips and a chicken snack box. When they are finished eating, they usually lower the windows of their cars and discharge the leftover rubbish on to the road. One can see such rubbish on every road throughout the country. I appeal to people to be civic-minded and to retain their rubbish until they return home where they can deposit it in bins. Roads are not meant for rubbish.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill about which I am particularly concerned is section 4, which is designed to amend section 22 of the 1996 Act to provide that the making of waste management plans will become an executive function. As far as county councils are concerned, I believe this will prove disastrous. In the current era of subsidiarity, inclusiveness and consultation, it is proposed that we silence ordinary citizens and neuter public representatives by transferring power to the executives of county councils. This proposal has been put forward by a Government which comprises so many former members of local authorities. Local public representatives speak on behalf of ordinary people and it is wrong that they will be placed in limbo and obliged to deal with another layer of bureaucracy. The Minister is making a fundamental error in transferring this type of authority to county managers because, as a previous speaker indicated, it will lead, to a certain extent, to the creation of dictatorships.</P>
    <P>The importance of secure landfill sites to counties comprised of large rural areas cannot be underestimated. Regardless of the type of waste management system one considers, there will always be a residual fraction of waste which must be disposed of in a landfill. In that context, landfill sites must, therefore, form an essential part of any solution to the waste management problem. That is not to say that serious consideration should not be given to other waste management systems or that waste minimisation and recycling and reuse should not be pursued with the utmost vigour. The fact remains that the presence of secure and viable landfill sites will enable county councils to plan sensibly for the future and to give mature consideration to other forms of waste disposal without being pressurised into making hasty decisions which might be regretted in the future.</P>
    <P>Even if a regional solution involving all the counties in the south-east is put forward, the concept of a central waste management system based on landfill will not conflict with that solution. The only change of significance which might occur is that waste which is being disposed of at a central waste management facility will, in the future, be transferred from that facility to a regional waste management centre somewhere in the south-east.</P>
    <P>If a regional solution for the south-east is considered, the quantity of waste arising in the five counties of Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary, Kilkenny and Carlow will be approximately 200,000 tonnes. The size of this quantity means <Col N="572" /> that incineration must be considered, with heat recovery as a possible disposal route. However, there are many imponderables associated with such a proposal. These include: public disquiet; the need for high risk capital to get the project up and running; problems with the disposal of residual materials, which may be regarded as hazardous waste; and political difficulties. The transboundary movement of waste associated with the original scheme will be bound to meet with substantial local opposition. Similarly, the transboundary movement of residual ash will create problems. If one were to commence such a project today, it would probably take seven to ten years to reach maturity, assuming that all obstacles could be overcome in the interim. It would probably take between ten to 12 years to get an incineration project up and running, particularly when one considers the court cases that would have to be fought in respect of obtaining planning permission etc.</P>
    <P>Having examined the options available, I consider that a cautious approach should be adopted in the selection of the waste management strategy for any county. In the short term, landfill should continue to be the principal method of disposal we use and local authorities should upgrade existing landfill sites as a matter of priority. Strenuous efforts are being made to continue to develop and expand existing recycling initiatives. It is important that all initiatives undertaken under waste management plans should be co-ordinated so that an integrated approach to waste management will be achieved. To this end, the following recommendations should be considered.</P>
    <P>First, a steering committee with members drawn from all sections of the community to review, promote and encourage waste management initiatives should be established. Reference is often made to consultation and, as far as waste management is concerned, if members of the public are not involved in initiatives progress will not be made. The second recommendation is that dedicated officers of county councils should be appointed to deal with waste management on a permanent basis. In that regard, officers in Wexford and other counties are often appointed to positions and six months later they are transferred. These individuals should be appointed for a five year term to allow them to resolve the problem of waste management in the counties in which they are employed. The third recommendation is that there should be maximum co-ordination with the Repak initiative in order that Government targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste are achieved. I am in full agreement with this recommendation because minimisation is extremely important. Bottle recycling plants in Wexford have proved very successful but we find it impossible to resolve the difficulties <i>vis-à-vis </i>the recycling of paper. If four or five counties operate a paper recycling initiative with each other they will achieve success in this area. However, a single county will be unsuccessful in its efforts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> Co-operation and encouragement, including financial support, are absolutely necessary if waste management initiatives are to be successful. We should also involve the private sector in terms of attracting financial support. The Minister has requested county councils to carry out certain functions but he has forgotten that each of them must locate funding to finance their initiatives. He is proposing that £15 be charged on every tonne of waste deposited in landfills. Wexford County Council already charges £67 per tonne. With the addition of the new charge, people will begin to discharge of their own waste which will be the worst scenario that could emerge.</P>
    <P>The issue of incineration and dioxins is extremely serious. Nobody is sure of the exact position in respect of this matter and it is scandalous that the Department has not provided councils with proper information in respect of it. Wexford County Council tried to make a decision on this matter and employed a number of experts, but members were left more confused when those experts had made their report. I appeal to the Minister to provide county councils with information on incineration.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the Nice referendum we must look again at the direction we propose to take and the degree to which we must live up to the expectations of our European colleagues. We must also recognise that the European Union is based on the combined desires and objectives of the 15 member states and not just one. The proposal is that it will enlarge and we must examine all the implications that have arisen since the Nice referendum. We must separate the questions that were raised and the manner in which they were dealt with. We must ask the electorate whether they wish to support the European project as they may have obligations under PFP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple answer is that we can opt out. However, Ireland opting out of the European project does not mean that it will cease. The European project will go ahead. The original founding fathers of modern Europe saw the <Col N="574" /> European Union, as it is now, as a means of ensuring we did not have another war or repeat the mistakes of the past. They saw it as a means of bringing the European people together in a sharing of sovereignty, power, culture and economic benefit and wealth in a way beneficial to all our people. We must put the question again to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Irish electorate did not vote against enlargement and one must assume that it did not. The question must be asked again as to whether we support the concept of enlargement unconditionally and allow other European people to join the European club. These aspects, which were not covered by debate prior to the Nice referendum but which are being debated almost frenetically in its aftermath, must be thrashed out.</P>
    <P>In order to assess where the European Union is going, our relevant committees will have to spend a great deal of time at the informal group, institutional and constitutional affairs meetings that take place in the European Parliament and in the various Parliaments of the member states. If we do not we will be left out. Much work is done at those informal meetings and many decisions are made which have a bearing on the future of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Committee on European Affairs met the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week and he was most helpful in his response to the requests made to him concerning the extra requirements of the committee in the present climate. I hope that, in the end, we will have something that is beneficial to us all and that the debate taking place now will mean the public will be better informed than they were prior to the referendum. It should be recognised that some of us, from all sides of the House, did our utmost to generate debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is my first opportunity to speak since the Treaty of Nice referendum took place. I spoke in full support of the treaty prior to the referendum. For those of us who campaigned the outcome was not such a surprise as it was to others. We received many negative vibes and many people told us they would vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; for a variety of reasons. People we knew previously as supporters of Europe, including members of the farming community, were concerned about the treaty. They were concerned mainly because of inadequate debate on the issues. There should have been more time and space for debate. An October referendum might have yielded a different result. Everybody says that the Irish people support the extension of the European Union and for decades we prayed for the conversion of Russia and Eastern Europe. Surely we should want to embrace Eastern Europe as part of our continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One good aspect of the result is that the political process and politicians must recognise that we are in a new era where Irish people will seriously review any decision to be made and will not <Col N="575" /> blindly follow people who try to persuade them. The people will reflect on the various reasons for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. There was not just one clear reason that people from extremely diverse ideologies voted the same way resulting in the defeat of the treaty. We must now ensure that the people understand what is happening in Europe.</P>
    <P>When I first saw details of the Treaty of Nice it took me some time to understand it and it needed a lot of study. As a politician I had the motivation to study it but the ordinary person will not give it the same time. It is up to us to create the debate and an understanding of the treaty. We must question the role and performance of the institutions of Europe, the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The fact that the Council of Ministers meets in private is an indication of the democratic deficit. Why does it not meet in public and let the people see what is happening? We must query more and the Joint Committee on European Affairs should have a strong role to play in questioning what is happening in Europe. It should be a conduit for the people and create an awareness of the implications of decisions made so that they can judge them for themselves. It should probably be the most powerful of the Oireachtas committees. The challenge is to provide a medium for the people through which to question and criticise decisions. We should have more debate on decisions made. In the past few weeks, after the Order of Business, Directives went through the Dáil without debate. Every one of them should have been debated and there should be a forum for detailed debate. There should be active involvement by the Oireachtas in reviewing, criticising and ensuring that we know the implications of directives, especially with regard to the larger and more complex decisions that are taken within European institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposed by Deputy Quinn is a useful contribution to the debate on Ireland's role in the European Union. It is particularly useful in regard to how we can ensure effective scrutiny by the Oireachtas of European Union business, leading in turn to a better understanding by the public of this important issue. Although this Bill is being taken in the context of the recent referendum on the Nice treaty, the issues addressed in it are essentially matters within our domestic competence. I was surprised, therefore, that some critics used perceived shortcomings in this area as a justification for voting against the treaty. The reality is that the Nice treaty makes no change to existing practice in these areas. However, the referendum result highlighted that the public felt, in a sense, disconnected from the work of the EU. It is right that we should examine at domestic level how we can remedy that. The renewed interest in improved arrangements for parliamen<Col N="576" /> tary scrutiny is to be welcomed. It is essential that we succeed in bringing Europe closer to its citizens and overcome the feeling among the public that they do not know what Europe does in their name, or how it does it.</P>
    <P>The Bill indicates some, although not all, of the questions which need to be examined in this regard. It is appropriate that we should consider how the Oireachtas might deal with draft proposals for regulations, directives and legislation. It is right that we took at the division of work between the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the other Oireachtas committees which over the years have built up considerable expertise in this area. The role of these committees in reviewing and approving draft legislation merits further detailed study. There are clearly areas where there is overlap and duplication. The Committee on European Affairs meets on a very regular basis and experiences some problems in that its work overlaps with that of other committees.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated in the Dáil yesterday that the Government fully supports the principle of greater parliamentary scrutiny and participation in relation to European Union business. He welcomed the overall purpose of the Bill in this regard while making it clear that this was without commitment to the specific content of it. It is necessary to examine the proposals in detail, and the Government intend to do so. It was correctly pointed out during the debate that such far-reaching changes are of fundamental importance to the role of the Oireachtas and should not and cannot be done as a matter of party politics. It is critical that the views of all sides are taken into account, including the views of those with direct experience in the area, such as the members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, raises a number of issues the implications of which for the conduct of Council business need to be teased out fully. The Minister indicated last night that he had referred the Bill to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration of some of these issues. For example, the Bill as drafted does not distinguish between the types of legal instruments which come before the Council of Ministers, a feature which would be unhelpful to Oireachtas committees in separating the important from the more mundane items which arise in the EU framework. Likewise, the Bill does not differentiate between the various procedures involved in the adoption of regulations and directives at EU level, including the role of the European Parliament as co-legislator in a wide variety of areas. This has implications for the timing of consideration of legislative instruments by the Oireachtas. Additionally, the timescales proposed in the Bill will need to be carefully considered to ensure they are consistent with the timeframes which apply in the normal process of Council business.</P>
    <P>All parties will also wish to ensure that new scrutiny procedures are flexible enough to allow <Col N="577" /> the Government of the day to represent Ireland's interests effectively at the Council of Ministers. As those with experience in this area will know, the Council, as befits its role, frequently negotiates and refines proposals which come before it. It will be necessary to ensure that Irish Ministers have the authority to intervene in such negotiations on a basis which does not put them at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their EU colleagues, and, more importantly, is consistent with protecting our national interest.</P>
    <P>Critics of the Treaty of Nice have overlooked the fact that the referendum outcome has hindered the start of a debate, called for in the treaty, on the future development of the Union. This debate is intended to address many of the issues that have given rise to concerns in Ireland, including how to improve the democratic accountability of the Union's institutions and how to enhance the role played by national parliaments in the EU framework. This latter point is particularly important given that, for the vast majority of citizens throughout the European Union, national parliaments continue to be the primary source of democratic identification.</P>
    <P>I expect that these and other questions concerning Ireland's role in Europe, covering all aspects, political as well as economic, will be the subject of detailed discussion at the forum on Europe to be established in the autumn. Against the background of Ireland's experience of EU membership, and the prospect of an enlarged Union, the forum will no doubt wish to consider issues raised during the Treaty of Nice referendum. It will also be able to consider proposals being made for the future development of the Union, expected to culminate in a further Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. The mandate for such a debate is contained in the declaration made at Nice on the future of the Union. Among the topics specifically listed for consideration are the &ldquo;need to improve and to monitor the democratic legitimacy of the Union and its institutions, in order to bring them closer to the citizens of the member states&rdquo;, and the role of national parliaments in the EU framework.</P>
    <P>Through a frank, open and thorough debate on the ideas proposed for future European co-operation and integration, the Government will be in a position to develop a negotiating position for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference based on the widest consensus possible. It is worth digressing to point out that one of the key functions of Government is to act on behalf of citizens who have democratically elected them to office in assessing the national interest and representing that interest in international negotiations. The Government played such a role in negotiating the Treaty of Nice, not just over four days and nights at Nice last December, but over the previous year of continual discussion and negotiation. During that period the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, reported regularly to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and Committee on Foreign Affairs, while the <Col N="578" /> Taoiseach and the Minister reported to the Dáil on an ongoing basis. The agreement reached at Nice protects all our essential interests while equipping the Union to move ahead with the vital task of enlargement. Each Government committed itself to the Nice treaty &ndash; an agreement viewed by all as an indispensable requirement for enlargement.</P>
    <P>The possibility of enlargement somehow proceeding without the Nice treaty has been raised once again. There is a simple point to be made in response. All the member states, and all the applicant countries, are committed to enlargement on the basis of the treaty and according to the timetable confirmed at Gothenburg. That timetable aims to have negotiations with the most advanced countries concluded by the end of next year. This is the political reality. Furthermore claims were made that provisions of the treaty, such as increasing the number of areas subject to qualified majority voting, or strengthening the European Commission, are not in Ireland's interests. These claims are completely at odds with our experience of membership, where democratic votes, clear rules and strengthened institutions protect the smaller states from the arbitrary use of power by the larger states.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate on the Nice treaty it became clear that many people felt that there was insufficient transparency and accountability in the conduct of the business of the Council of Ministers. This is perhaps a valid criticism, but the Government was at pains to point out that whatever deficiencies exist should not be blamed on Europe, and certainly not on the Nice treaty which makes no change in this area. The solution to such problems clearly lies with the Oireachtas in devising new arrangements which satisfy the public demand for accountability while ensuring that Irish Ministers can operate effectively in Council.</P>
    <P>Of course arrangements for scrutinising proposals for legislation coming before the Council of Ministers already exist. The Joint Committee on European Affairs already examines all proposals for Council regulations and makes appropriate recommendations. However, given the volume of material coming before the committee, there is merit in the proposal to review the functioning of Oireachtas committees in this regard. In particular it is worth examining whether the other Oireachtas committees might play a greater role in support of that undertaken at present by the Joint Committee on European Affairs. It will also be necessary to examine the arrangements for briefing committees on the constant flow of draft legislation, including through the use of modern technology, and to consider how that briefing can be made as useful as possible to committee members.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated during last night's debate, the Government has a positive disposition on the principle of strengthened parliamentary scrutiny and participation. The details of the proposed Bill need to be exam<Col N="579" /> ined carefully to ensure the room for manoeuvre essential for Ministers involved in Council negotiations is maintained. All sides will agree that given the far-reaching implications of such changes, every effort must be made to ensure the Oireachtas is united on the proposals, and that changes are as workable and user friendly as possible. Given the seriousness of the issues involved, it is important we get this right.</P>
    <P>This debate is important and timely. Accountability and transparency are not just buzz words, but vital aspects of democratic government. We need to explain fully the role Ireland plays in the European Union. I am convinced that the more these issues are outlined and discussed, the more the public will identify with our positive experience of membership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available to me I would like to focus on the parts of this Bill which relate to the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the proposals for amendments to the defence Acts. A much better understanding of Ireland's contribution to the formulation and conduct of the Common Foreign and Security Policy is needed. There appears to be a lack of appreciation of the opportunity that Ireland's role in the CFSP provides for the pursuit of our foreign policy principles and interests. Certain mistaken perceptions need to be dispelled, for example, the idea that Ireland can be coerced into supporting EU foreign policy decisions to which we are opposed. Other fallacious perceptions include the belief that we can be silenced or ignored in the formulation of EU foreign policy, or that we are somehow prevented from pursuing policies or initiatives on a national basis.</P>
      <P>Ireland's overall experience of foreign policy co-operation with our EU partners has been very positive and we have never been shy in putting forward our views and contributing to the European Union's voice in international affairs. As a small country with a successful economy dependent on access to world markets if it is to continue to prosper and grow, we want the European Union to play the fullest possible role. The full influence of the European Union should be brought to bear in support of a global order committed to international peace and security, the pacific settlement of disputes, human rights and the rule of law in international affairs. We have pursued these traditional goals of Ireland's foreign policy through our participation in the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Ireland's voice has been enhanced, not hindered through our involvement in EU foreign policy co-operation. As in other areas of EU activity, our experience suggests that pooled sovereignty gives us greater influence and control over our destiny, without surrendering our right to pursue issues on a national basis as we see fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the concerns voiced during the debate <Col N="580" /> on the Nice Treaty was a feeling that the European Union is becoming a &ldquo;superstate&rdquo;. Others expressed concern about the hijacking of the European Union, in some unspecified way, by larger member states who will dictate its future direction. I do not share such concerns as they do not reflect the reality of our experience of EU membership during the last 28 years. They do not stand up to close scrutiny when one looks closely at the provisions of the Nice Treaty governing EU foreign and security policy co-operation. The provisions to which I refer were drafted by Ireland and other like-minded partners in successive Intergovernmental Conferences when parties on both sides of the House were in government. Having said that, we need to explore concerns in depth to achieve much better public understanding of the European Union's role in the world and how EU foreign and security policy is negotiated and implemented.</P>
    <P>The suggestions for future handling in the Oireachtas of joint actions under the CFSP, set out in section 5 of this Bill, are very useful in this regard. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs told the House yesterday, the Government is open to any suggestions or ideas that enhance discussion, debate and understanding of the European Union's international role and the breadth and scope given to Ireland to pursue foreign and security policy goals and objectives. Deputy Quinn's Bill also intends to facilitate Irish participation in humanitarian and crisis management activities which might arise in an EU framework with UN authorisation, an approach that is to be welcomed. The United Nations has encouraged regional approaches to peacekeeping and I am glad to note that developments within the European Union in this area are evolving along similar lines. It is encouraging to see that the close co-operation between the European Union and the United Nations on these matters is expected to develop further in the months ahead. The positive outcome of the meeting which took place last month between the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and EU Foreign Ministers was an important indicator in this regard.</P>
    <P>The proposals for amendments to the defence Acts in relation to service abroad by members of the Permanent Defence Force can be seen in the context of Ireland's role in the development of the European Union's security and defence policy. The Government has confirmed on many occasions that the deployment of Irish personnel and resources in overseas missions will be considered only if a UN mandate is already in place. Moreover, it is clear that the types of crisis management mission which might be undertaken by the European Union and in which Ireland might participate are consistent with those in which we have engaged, under the United Nations, for over 40 years. Much of this has been forgotten in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>During the lead-up to the referendum, there was confusion as to whether Ireland could conceivably take part in a crisis management oper<Col N="581" /> ation without a UN mandate, but that is not and has never been a possibility. However, in order to address any confusion which arose through misunderstanding or misinformation, the Government is positively disposed to further clarifying the position. As part of ongoing efforts to dispel fears and anxieties which arose during the referendum campaign, I expect there will be a full examination of the steps that can be taken to allay concerns. A centrally important consideration is that, in accordance with the provisions of the defence Acts, the approval of this House is an essential precondition before deployment of Irish personnel.</P>
    <P>Ireland's distinguished record of involvement in UN peacekeeping is second to none. I share the view of the vast majority of the Irish people in expressing my pride about Ireland's role in this area. It is important that the record is maintained and developed, as to do otherwise would be to fly in the face of efforts to try to prevent events such as the horrific interethnic conflict in the Balkans from taking place again. The peacekeeping area is one where Ireland has, can, and will continue to make a positive contribution in keeping with our traditions and values. Our future contribution will take into account the changing and more complex nature of peacekeeping, which involves additional tasks such as humanitarian assistance, the protection of human rights and civilian police work. This is essentially what the European Union's security and defence policy is all about.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, whether by design or intention, some doubts have been created about Ireland's role in European security and defence policy issues and how we should play our part in the international community. Perhaps the description of the EU headline goal as a &ldquo;rapid reaction force&rdquo; has allowed those who are so minded to create doubts in the minds of others, despite the fact that the force is emphatically not a standing army. Ireland's involvement is fully consistent with a policy of military neutrality, to which the Government remains firmly committed. The European Union is putting together a pool of capabilities to provide the Union with the means to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks. It is important that discussion about developments in European security and defence policy take place on the basis of fact. We should not proceed on the basis of scaremongering, or exaggerated suggestions of what the European Union is doing in this area. In particular, we should not ignore the events which we have witnessed in the Balkans in the past decade. These events have made clear that Europe needs to be in a position to play a full part in maintaining peace and stability. Ireland should not turn its back on this challenge which lies at the heart of Europe's future well-being and prosperity.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight that European security and defence policy is not only about developing military capabilities. It involves developing a spectrum of tools which the European Union can have at its disposal with the objective of making <Col N="582" /> the Common Foreign and Security Policy more effective and more visible. In this connection, the development of the European Union's conflict prevention and civilian crisis management capabilities has a central role to play. The civilian crisis management area was a particular priority of the Swedish EU Presidency, which is coming to a close. One of the main tasks in the civilian area has been to carry forward work on the establishment of a goal to provide police in support of peacekeeping operations. Good progress has also been made in other priority areas &ndash; the rule of law, civilian administration and civil protection.</P>
    <P>The enhancement of the European Union's capabilities for conflict prevention has also received particular attention in recent months. An important EU programme for the prevention of violent conflicts was approved at the Gothenburg European Council earlier this month. This is a welcome development form Ireland's perspective. The programme sets out a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention. It identifies political priorities for preventive actions and measures to ensure early warning and policy. In doing so, it highlights the key importance of addressing the long-term root causes of conflict and emphasises the importance of effective partnership with international organisations such as the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has briefed the House regularly on these developments. However, the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum illustrated in very stark terms the need for greater efforts to keep both the Oireachtas and the public fully informed. In this light, the overall purpose of the proposals in Deputy Quinn's Bill are to be welcomed. I look forward to the opportunity for this House to debate these issues in more detail after all the implications have been carefully teased out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies McManus and Gormley.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Government's decision, announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night, not to oppose the Bill on Second Stage. However, the Labour Party is aware of the less than subtle difference between not opposing Second Stage and allowing the Bill to be enacted. I take what has been signalled by the Government in good faith and hope the legislation will be processed through Committee Stage to permit a fuller debate on the numerous specific issues raised by the Minster for Foreign Affairs and others which need to be addressed by way of amendment.</P>
      <P>However, the legislation essentially begins the substantial reform that this House is required to introduce to make the European project, to which the bulk of Members are committed, a more acceptable, real, transparent, vibrant and exciting concept for our people who are genuinely turned off and worried about the project through a lack of understanding and clarity from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the contributions made by the Minister <Col N="583" /> in response to Deputy Quinn last night and sympathise with his response. He denied the existence of a left-right divide among pro-Europeans in Ireland and even that there was a left-right divide in Europe. He has yet to offer himself for election to the European Parliament, although others who have held that office have done so. Should he do so he would no doubt be successful and then discover that there is such a divide in the European Parliament. Politics in virtually all European countries is characterised by a social and Christian democratic agenda. Ireland is unique in that such an agenda has not characterised its politics to date.</P>
    <P>The Minister's party has evolved into a classic Christian democratic party but it cannot sit in the Christian democratic group in the European Parliament because the evolution of the Fianna Fáil Party to that position was much slower than that of Fine Gael and because Fine Gael is already part of the group it will not allow Fianna Fáil to join. The reluctance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to acknowledge that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, is an ideological classic 19th century liberal and a self-acknowledged Eurosceptic, whose politics, I suspect, would be rejected by many of his Cabinet colleagues, cuts to the heart of the difficulties regarding political debate in Ireland, which is often devoid of ideological content and more is the pity.</P>
    <P>The Minister's technical comments in respect of our Bill and the difficulties they might pose are not significant. The legislation takes account of the need to make speedy decisions and emphasises the need for prior consultation and proper reporting rather than mandating. However, it is important that if a decision is taken by an Irish Minister in Europe that is repugnant to the Dáil, a mechanism should be put in place to address this.</P>
    <P>The Acting Chairman will be aware that the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights dealt with a regulation that arises under the Fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty, which was referred to it by the House this morning. We are required because of an opt-in clause Ireland has under that protocol in regard to certain justice matters to have a debate and seek affirmation from both Houses of the Oireachtas. However, there is a plethora of other resolutions that impact on the daily lives of citizens which are not subject to such parliamentary scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Even when there is a constitutional requirement, as provided for in the legislation, or a legal requirement for oversight by the House, Ministers often treat the process with contempt, as do Departments, by rushing proposals at the last minute saying they must be agreed today. The regulation we debated earlier was referred to the committee this morning, although the notices for the meeting issued yesterday. It was dealt with by the committee this afternoon because it had to be disposed of before the end of the session. That is <Col N="584" /> a bad way to deal with important measures and it is something we must fundamentally improve.</P>
    <P>The issue of the mandate given to Ministers before they attend the Council of Ministers is much more important. I have had the privilege of serving on two Councils and chaired the Environment Council in 1996. There is no parliamentary scrutiny of the positions taken on important issues and all parties are guilty in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was amused by the recent comments of the Attorney General who referred to the deficiency of transparency at EU level. The only way I can obtain information about the Justice and Home Affairs Council is through the Commission's website. I can access the agenda for the Council's meeting and the position of most member states on the website. There is no natural reporting mechanism to the House on these issues and Ministers attend Councils without a mandate. They do not have an idea of the views of this House on those issues. Unfortunately, they are often represented at these meetings by officials. A colleague looked at the attendance records of some members of the Government. The attendance record of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, for example, would not inspire confidence. It is bad when she takes it upon herself to criticise the institutions of the European Union yet she will not go to represent our position there as she is required and mandated to do in our name. We have a responsibility to take control of these matters. An external force will not do that. We must reform our actions so that the accountability we are demanding at the core is reflected here. That is reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>When I became a Member of the Oireachtas, I was in the Seanad and was a member of the committee on secondary legislation. At least it was a mechanism that enabled us to look at such legislation. A more effective proposal, in light of the voluminous amount of secondary legislation by way of direction and regulation coming from the institutions in Europe, is to have individual committees. The select and joint committees we established are struggling to work well and are doing so reasonably well. As I suggested today at the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, we should have as a norm a secondary legislation sub-committee so that every regulation can be discussed and every Minister armed with the opinions of Parliament before he or she goes to a Council meeting in Europe. This gives more strength to the position being argued. If a Minister can outline the strong view of his or her Parliament, across all parties, on an issue, it gives a stronger mandate for the position being argued at the Council.</P>
    <P>I support the rapid reaction force because I am an internationalist. We have seen horrible moral dilemmas on this Continent in recent times and we must be part of solving them. As an internationalist, I do not understand people who have a narrow view of intervention to protect the lives of people who are oppressed or being destroyed <Col N="585" /> as, when we aspired to our national freedom, we were always prepared to look abroad for help. We should not look forward to isolationism. It stretches credibility when parties, particularly those with military wings, speak about isolationism and their abhorrence of military actions.</P>
    <P>I look forward on another occasion to having a longer time to make a contribution, but I yield to my colleague, Deputy McManus. I hope there will be an opportunity on Committee Stage for a fuller debate and that the Government's signal last night is for real.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important Bill. The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, and those who helped to draft this Bill are entitled to the gratitude of the House for bringing this legislation forward. I also welcome the response by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, when he said he would accept the general principle of the Bill. I hope it is a genuine acceptance of the spirit of this Bill and not just an attempt to buy time.</P>
      <P>We have not had good experiences on this side of the House with promises by the Government to accept in principle Bills put forward by the Labour Party. In June 1999 the Government decided not to oppose the Second Stage of the whistleblower's Bill introduced by Deputy Rabbitte and indicated its acceptance in principle. Two years later, the Bill has not got any further as the Government has refused to facilitate it being taken in Committee. Our experience with the Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill was worse. When the Bill was taken on Second Stage in May last year it was not opposed by the Government, a move we understood indicated acceptance of it in principle. In this instance, the Government not only blocked the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government from considering the Committee Stage of the Bill but, after much delay and foot dragging, introduced its own Bill which sought to copperfasten corporate donations to political parties. This proposal was directly contrary to the spirit of the Labour Party Bill.</P>
      <P>We will take the Minister at his word, but we also intend to hold him to it. We are more than willing to look at the technical details of the Bill and we will be happy to consider any possible changes, amendments or improvements on Committee Stage. However, we will not accept foot dragging nor will we accept any attempt to undermine the principles of scrutiny and accountability that are the core of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact this Bill is being proposed by the Labour Party when it should be coming from the Government side of the House is an indication of how poorly the Government prepared the case for the Nice treaty and how dreadful its response has been since the people rejected it. We have had more debate on the Nice treaty since its rejection than was permitted by the Government prior to the referendum. Since the Labour Party <Col N="586" /> pointed out this was a problem, we could have said we told the Government the people would vote against it. However, this Bill presents a way to guarantee debate into the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to address two issues which arose frequently during the referendum campaign on the Nice treaty, though they are ones that stand apart from it. If the treaty had been endorsed by the Irish electorate on 7 June, these measures would still have to be addressed. If that treaty was not heard about again, these are reforms which should still be introduced. The Bill has two principal purposes. It seeks to introduce a set of new procedures that would significantly improve the level of scrutiny by the Oireachtas of measures proposed to be taken by the EU Council of Ministers. The Bill also provides for reporting and consultation with relevant committees of the Oireachtas by Ministers.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been in Government and who have attended Council of Ministers meetings know the way decisions are made at that level is unsatisfactory. They are not open to public scrutiny but are made on the basis that the work has been done by excellent civil servants. Ministers are wheeled in and given their speaking notes in the hope they will not stray too far from them. Many of us heard Eamon Delaney quoting a civil servant who referred to Ministers as chimpanzees. We did not totally dismiss that relationship. I am not criticising civil servants but the methods of decision-making at meetings of the Council of Ministers is not satisfactory and is bound to lead to a lack of accountability and scrutiny. That is the type of problem this Bill intends to address.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to amend the Defence Acts to provide for participation by the Defence Forces with the EU's rapid reaction force but only where it is operating under a specific United Nations mandate. There was a range of reasons people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, some of which related to domestic political issues while others were not so directly related. However, there were two recurring themes. One was a concern about the rapid reaction force and the other was a genuine concern among the electorate about a lack of accountability in terms of legislative measures introduced by the EU and agreed by Irish Ministers which have a significant impact on their lives. As a citizen and a Deputy, I share the concern about deficiencies in European structures as well as in our domestic political system. In many cases the first time the public, or Members of the Dáil, become aware of the position the Government is adopting on a crucial issue is after the Council of Ministers has signed off on a directive, and it is far too late at that point to influence the position our Government has adopted.</P>
    <P>In my area of responsibility, health, the question about the working times of junior hospital doctors was an issue of extreme importance here. That issue deserved debate in this House, yet we were completely stymied in terms of being able to influence, and discover, the Government's <Col N="587" /> position in terms of working out the working time directive and the position it was taking <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries where there was a whole range of views in terms of the length of time of implementation of the directive. Some countries were of the view that a lengthy period of 13 years was required while others felt there was no need to implement the directive because the working times had already been reduced to a humane and proper level.</P>
    <P>That was a crucial debate in terms of the future of our health service, but we were not part of it. It is a fundamental issue among many other fundamental political issues that need to be opened up to ensure decisions are made from the best possible position and strengthened by the debate in this House but also that the public can have confidence that the system is open to scrutiny and influences from the people to ensure their needs are taken account of; otherwise we will have a further distancing between the people and a bureaucracy which is moving further away rather than closer to them.</P>
    <P>On the question of neutrality, we are dealing with our relationship on issues which are problematic but on which we need to have a real debate. If, for example, we had circumstances in Europe that occurred in the Second World War, would we take pride in adopting a neutral stance today?</P>

      <P>Would we say that fascism is something we do not have to counteract or oppose? It is not likely to happen, and it is a very extreme example, but we need to define neutrality in a way that is appropriate to today's world. I have no doubt there is an important role for neutral countries, but we need to speak in terms that are relevant to today's world and not try to adopt, as Deputy Howlin said, an isolationist position, which is meaningless.</P>
      <P>The approach some have towards neutrality is rather like the approach many have to abortion. It is all right as long as other countries are dealing with the issue. It is all right as long as the French or somebody else is looking after our women in crisis pregnancies, but as a neutral country we have to take responsibility, however difficult that is, in terms of dealing with the realities of the modern world.</P>

All we have heard is rumour and statement from sources close to the Government, but no one has actually come out and said we will have another referendum. We have to have another referendum because if the treaty is not renegotiated, and Europe is depending on Ireland for this treaty to be ratified, we have to have a referendum. The Government should therefore come out and say it. The problem for the Government was that there was a lack of clarity during the referendum and we are now having the same sort of obfuscation after it.</P>

      <P>The issues raised during the campaign were militarisation, the voting strengths on the Council of Ministers and enhanced co-operation. This Bill addresses the idea of accountability. It is clear that up to now, when one of our Ministers went off to the Council of Ministers, we were not properly informed in this Chamber. That is a welcome development because now we will have some form of debate. We prompted that by urging people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;. It would never have happened otherwise, but the question of the voting strengths has not been addressed here. This is the core idea about which we spoke during the campaign. The fact is that Ireland now has three votes out of 83. The Germans have ten out of 83.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is talking about demographics, which I will address. Ireland will increase to ten. The Germans will go up to 29. Immediately one can see there is a shift.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to population. There was a proposal that we would have a dual majority, that it would be one vote per country and related to 50% of the population. That was rejected by the French, and the Germans decided to go along. We then had the system we now have in the Nice treaty. Throughout Europe, the smaller countries were not very comfortable with this. In fact, the Portuguese delegation walked out and said it was an institutional <i>coup d'état</i>. They got no support from the Irish delegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said it has to be about population. It is already about population in the European Parliament. When Gerhard Schröder <Col N="589" /> talks about a second chamber, that second chamber being the Council of Ministers, will that be about demographics as well? We should contrast that with the model in the United States where, regardless of the size of the state, two Senators represent it. That recognises sovereignty, although our sovereignty is gone down the drain. It recognises statehood to some extent and is about equality, but with the Nice treaty, that is gone. The partnership of equals that we joined in 1973 is a thing of the past.</P>

      <P>On the idea of enhanced co-operation, this is a dangerous concept and an integral part of the treaty. Incidentally, all these reforms will take place in 2005 regardless of whether any new states join the Union. Romano Prodi gave the lie to the claims during the campaign that this was solely about enlargement. He said that enlargement can take place anyway, that it is legally possible. It is not politically acceptable because the Germans and the French made it a precondition. That was the whole idea behind the Nice treaty. If we enlarge, the bigger states will get more power. In essence, that is what it is about and this forum and this Bill will not change that. The people will examine the arguments, as they did in the campaign.</P>
      <P>I want to address the question of militarisation. The Bill, and particularly the explanatory memorandum, is very interesting. Referring to section 6, the memorandum states, &ldquo;The section does <i>not</i> state that service outside the State by Defence Force contingents can only be with a UN Force: it stipulates rather that service with a UN Force can only be pursuant to a resolution of the Dáil&rdquo;. That is precisely what we said during the campaign for which we were dismissed as scaremongers. The Government is tying itself up in knots again. It stated that we could only undertake such service with a UN mandate. However, this highlights the fact that there is a loophole. The Government now has to admit this fact. In the post Nice treaty debate the Government will find itself having to admit&mdash;</P>

      <P>The central problem is that we are still talking about the rapid reaction force. This has not changed because of this Bill. During debate on the Amsterdam treaty we were told that the force solely concerned the Petersberg Tasks and peacekeeping and that it would be an extension of the UN. This view was repeated during the campaign on the Nice treaty. However, the Petersberg Tasks also include crisis management and peace enforcement. At no stage was this mentioned during debate on the Amsterdam treaty. We were never told that we would have a rapid reaction force. Irish people do not want to be a part of the European rapid reaction force. They want to be part of the UN, and we have a proud record in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a most useful debate which has allowed the House to address in a focused fashion the important issue of Oireachtas oversight of European Union business. It is realised on all sides that we must do more to bring the Community closer to its citizens and to give the public a greater sense of ownership of its activities. We have to break down this sense of them and us which too many use when talking about the Community. We are the European Union; it belongs to all of us.</P>
      <P>It is a measure of the achievement of the European Union that the candidate states, many of which are engaged in the difficult task of rebuilding their democratic institutions and revitalising their economies, attach such importance to realising their ambition for membership of the Union. The Government has emphasised, notwithstanding the outcome of the Nice referendum, that there remains broad support for enlargement across all sections of Irish opinion. In this regard, I am pleased to announce on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is undertaking an official visit to Prague today and tomorrow, that the Government has decided to open resident missions in four of the candidate countries, namely, Cyprus, Estonia, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. This decision should be seen as evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to the enlargement of the European Union and as an earnest of its determination to work for the strengthening and developing of close and cordial relations with the candidate countries.</P>
      <P>This process of extending the State's diplomatic network, including in the context of enlargement, will continue. The Government decided yesterday that resident missions will be opened in all candidate countries over a two year period. These decisions reflect the importance the Government attaches to strengthening our bilateral ties with the countries in question. Many of them look to Ireland as a model for what they hope to achieve through making effective use of the opportunities afforded by membership.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that it was not the intention of the Irish people in the referendum on 7 June to deny to these countries their legitimate aspirations for a better future which potentially has important political and economic benefits for all of us who share the continent of Europe. Many of those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side have clearly stated that they are not opposed to enlargement of the Union. All of the indications are that people do not oppose enlargement. However, there are a range of issues relating to the European Union about which the public has concerns. The fact that many of these may not be soundly based does not detract from the fact that citizens deserve to have these issues addressed. All Members acknowledge that there are issues which need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of critical importance in this regard is the <Col N="592" /> capacity of our parliamentary institutions at national level to monitor and review development within the European Union. It has been recognised on all sides that the Joint Committee on European Affairs has made an important contribution in this regard, and that there has been insufficient public appreciation of what it has been able to accomplish. However, it is also acknowledged, given the sheer volume of issues with which it has to deal, many of which are highly technical, that the current arrangements require a comprehensive review.</P>
    <P>The Bill submitted by Deputy Quinn makes a useful contribution in this regard. It raises many of the right issues, but the Deputy has been good enough to acknowledge that devising the appropriate responses which take account of the need to ensure that the Government can operate effectively within the EU system, is a complicated matter that will require detailed consultations. There is a need to balance the requirement for accountability with the need to ensure that Ministers are in a position to protect our national interests in a fast-moving negotiating process. A number of the provisions of the Bill, as drafted, raise difficulties in this regard.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated yesterday, the Government does not intend to oppose the Bill on Second Stage. It is committed to improving arrangements for parliamentary scrutiny. We will closely examine the detailed provisions of the Bill, following which we will consult again with the Opposition. The Government will, in due course, bring forward considered proposals on issues raised by the Bill. We welcome the overall purpose of the Bill but without commitment as to the specific proposals pending further examination of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to acknowledge that there has been a change of approach to the debate on Europe which many of us have been seeking for a long time. Members of successive Governments who have been involved in EU Councils have felt the need for a closer engagement, not just with the Oireachtas but also with citizens.</P>
    <P>I hope the media will involve itself more vigorously on issues that might not always constitute a controversial or headline story. There are many good stories on issues that are relevant to ordinary people which need to be reported and I hope this will be the case.</P>
    <P>In a previous Government I served as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs when we initiated a process called &ldquo;the communicating Europe&rdquo;. This process was pursued by the subsequent Government. We need to examine the issue of getting the message across and the media will have to be involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley referred to the question of equality between larger and smaller states. My experience is that small states have benefited from their involvement in the EU. As Minister of State with responsibility for international trade I <Col N="593" /> am involved in dealing with many issues in which Irish people would like to see us involved. For example, there is a strong commitment from the EU on international trade with the developing world. That is crucial with regard to our policies for helping the developing world which have been pursued by successive Governments. As a Minister representing the Government, I have been able to pursue the agenda for the next world trade talks in Qatar where we will pursue an approach that will support developing countries. My proposal is that this should be a development round.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I met representatives of nine or ten NGOs, including Trócaire and Oxfam, to discuss these issues. That is an example of how we can deal with the question of communications. In addition, we discussed how best to pursue a development agenda on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The result of the Nice vote can do much good for all of us, including those who are genuinely committed to, and wish to argue the case for, the European Union. We are well able to do so. Equally, we can play an important role by punching above our weight at EU level and making an important contribution, in my case, on issues such as the need to care for the developing world community. That will be the Government's priority when it comes to the next round of world trade talks. That is an example of a small nation making a contribution.</P>
    <P>Although we obviously did not explain this well enough, qualified majority voting helps smaller countries because under the unanimity situation a larger state will hold out and can block other countries from making progressive advancements. That has been my experience and the experience of others who have served at European Council level.</P>
    <P>There are many issues to be taken into account and I will not start making accusations against anybody. It is difficult for any Government to dig deep into the Nice agenda, draw conclusions and get to the real issues. There is much jargon that we will have to try to deal with in future. Now is the time to move on, involve people and explain the issues to them. The people are entitled to know all the facts and I will do my best to get the message across. My areas of involvement include international trade, labour issues at the Social Affairs Council, and consumer issues. Those issues are at the heart of the matter. We can pool our resources and work in a united way in our approach to the European Union.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to the Union. There are ways whereby we can work well together in a united fashion and where it is best that we work as colleagues and there is the issue of protecting national interests. I predict that we will never see a European super state of which some people are fearful. It is not only Irish people who are concerned about such a development, people throughout the European Union would also be concerned if that were to occur. It does not need <Col N="594" /> to happen, however, and as far as I am concerned it will not.</P>
    <P>The rapid reaction force issue was well handled by successive Governments, going back to the Amsterdam treaty. We took a partnership approach to participate on a voluntary basis whereby Dáil approval would be sought case by case and with a UN mandate. We can provide people with clear arguments and explanations concerning the rapid reaction force. Let us get down to the nitty gritty of explaining what is really happening in the European Union. Hopefully, those involved in the media will help us to get our message across.</P>
    <P>I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion which has given us an opportunity to commence what will be a very important debate.</P>

      <P>We were treated as more equal than the bigger states. That has been reduced slightly by the Nice treaty but there is still a bias in favour of the smaller states. There are many other issues that I would like to debate and I look forward to doing so with Deputy Gormley in the forum on the future of Europe. He needs to look seriously at this reactionary alliance with which he is currently associated. This old style, re-heated, 19th century nationalism that Sinn Féin is promoting as some kind of Valhalla for the Irish people does not reflect the reality of the world in which we live where if one does not share one's sovereignty one has no influence whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, the German state, which is one of the major economies in Europe, could not impose its will on the multinational corporations concerning corporation tax. Unless we combine our sovereignty as members of the European Union the multinational corporations will run over us. They will run riot and will rule the roost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enhanced co-operation will help the environment in Europe. As a member of the Green Party, Deputy Gormley should recognise the realities of life instead of parroting this Sinn Féinism with which Gerry Adams and Deputy Ó Caoláin, who is also absent from this debate, are trying to drag us down. They are trying to drag us back to at least the 1950s. I grew up in the 1950s and was fed this nonsense that Sinn Féin is going on about today. Much to my regret, I bought it and it took me a long time to get out of it. I do not want to see another generation of young people being led down the same road by Sinn <Col N="595" /> Féin. It is promoting its exclusive, sectarian nationalism in Northern Ireland and is trying to import it into the Republic. I will not accept it. I will stand up against it and seek to defeat it at every hand's turn. I simply do not want to see Ireland dragged back into this sort of mé féin, green nationalism that it is promoting, and with which the Green Party is aligning itself.</P>
    <P>We are promoting a Bill, not just a motion. I have not heard any of the Ministers who contributed to the debate saying they will introduce legislation. They said they would clarify the matter of the UN mandate and would introduce proposals in the Dáil concerning accountability but I have not heard any suggestion that they will introduce legislation. Yet, we need complete clarity in the legal sense.</P>
    <P>One of the most common fallacies aired in all member states of the European Union is that Brussels, whatever that is, imposes or forces countries to accept courses of action against their will. This claim is complete and utter nonsense.</P>

      <P>European treaties have set out broad aims and objectives for the European Union. These include high levels of environmental protection, the establishment of a single market, the introduction of a single currency and minimum social standards. The treaties set out the means by which these objectives are to be attained.</P>
      <P>Since 1987, when the Single European Act came into effect, more of these decisions have been taken by a qualified majority in the Council where each country is, supposedly, represented by Ministers. In recommending European treaties to the Irish people, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have expressly endorsed the objectives, decision-making procedures and outcomes of negotiations based on these objectives and procedures. It is well to remember that because a decision can be taken by a majority, it does not mean that it is actually taken in that way. Consensus is the overriding objective within Council and strenuous efforts are made by all sides, by the Presidency and particularly by the Commission, to ensure that as many countries as possible are accommodated in the final outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a complex bargaining process involving 15 member states, few decisions will completely satisfy every member state but if a Government represents its country's interests well, no country should ever be permanently dissatisfied. It is complete and utter nonsense, therefore, for Ministers to complain about Europe forcing issues on us. Take the complaints of the Minister for Arts, <Col N="596" /> Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Ó Cuiv, about unnamed European directives which supposedly undermine Ireland's cultural traditions. Even though neither of them has bothered to elaborate on what they mean, it is commonly understood that both are referring to two of the most important nature conservation directives, the wild birds directive and the habitats directive. Both directives were negotiated and agreed to by Fianna Fáil Governments, the wild birds directive in April 1979 and the habitats directive in May 1992.</P>
    <P>In joining the Common Market in 1973, Ireland agreed to pool sovereignty with other countries in order to achieve things that we could not do alone but could do through common action. Under the terms put to the people by the Government in 1972 and in place since, the pooling of sovereignty weakened the scrutiny of legislation by the Oireachtas. Consequently, Deputies and Senators, and the people, have little or no idea of the positions taken on European affairs by Ministers within Council. We do not even know for sure if they bother to attend. What little information the Oireachtas gets about the actions of Ministers in Council is largely gleaned from unofficial sources &ndash; for example, the appalling attendance records of the Minister, Deputy de Valera, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuiv, at the Culture Council.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that the last Government six monthly report on European affairs, as required under the 1972 European Communities Act, dealing with developments in the first half of 1999, was published in October 2000. No action has been taken on appointing a Minister for European affairs. No action has been taken on the provisions contained in the Amsterdam treaty that all Commission proposals be made available to the Oireachtas at least six weeks before they are decided upon in Council.</P>
    <P>The Common Market that Ireland joined in 1973 was deeply undemocratic. Legislative decisions were proposed by a largely unaccountable Commission and decided by an unaccountable Council, meeting behind closed doors. Despite the common perception, as well as the deliberate misinformation spread by Eurosceptics, considerable progress has been made in the last decade in strengthening democracy in Europe. The democratically elected European Parliament now shares co-decision powers with the Council over a very wide area of European activity &ndash; environmental protection, Single Market, consumer rights, energy, social policy etc. This means that approximately 70% of European legislation affecting all member states cannot come into effect until it has been thoroughly scrutinised by a parliamentary chamber representing voters in all member states. One of the unsung benefits of the Nice treaty is that it increases this democratic role further by obliging Council to share decision-making power with the European Parliament over the European Union's emerging <Col N="597" /> equality agenda, Article 13. This increased role played by democratically accountable parliamentarians not only means that we have better European legislation and programmes but also that the public is more aware of them. Last year's directive limiting junior doctors' working hours is a prime example.</P>
    <P>The introduction and progressive extension of co-decision between the European Parliament and the Council has also been accompanied by greater control of the European Parliament over the Commission and its President. It was the European Parliament which forced the resignation of the Commission in 1999, not the member states. I for one believe that there is some way to go before we can say that European decisions are transparently made &ndash; there clearly is a need for more co-decision and making the Commission and its President more accountable. Whatever about achieving democratic accountability at European level, not enough progress has been made at member state level. For this reason, the role of national parliaments in European affairs is one of the four main items the Nice summit decided should be examined in detail before the 2004 European Reform Council, Intergovernmental Conference. We should stop this Intergovernmental Conference business and say what it is actually about &ndash; the reform of the European Union &ndash; and call it a European reform conference.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's European Union Bill seeks to address the democratic deficit in Ireland over EU affairs. The Bill does something that should have been done when Ireland joined the EEC in 1973 and definitely when the Single European Act and greater qualified majority voting came into effect 14 years ago. In short, it aims to ensure the Government does not commit Ireland to a policy that is opposed by a majority in the Dáil, just as the people will not have a Government which is unacceptable to a majority within the Dáil. By obliging the Government to set out its European policies, the Bill will increase awareness and understanding of EU affairs among the Oireachtas and the public at large.</P>
    <P>For example, the Government would have to explain the reason it negotiated an opt-out to the worker consultation directive agreed by the Social Affairs Council on 12 June. It would have to justify the hotchpotch two year anti-poverty plan presented to the Commission on 1 June under the anti-poverty strategy agreed at the Nice summit last December,and explain the reason, at the first discussion of the plan in Council, Ireland was represented by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, a very able man &ndash; I am not criticising him &ndash; rather than the Minister responsible, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, would have had to explain what position she is taking today in the Telecommunications Council in Luxembourg on the proposed directive to further liberalise European postal <Col N="598" /> services from 2003. Will she go along with the line advocated by the Taoiseach at the Stockholm summit in March to push this measure through by the end of the year, or will she accept the recommendations I drew up for the European Parliament and accepted overwhelmingly by it, to take greater account of the regional and employment implications of hasty liberalisation?</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, would have to explain the reason he did not attend the joint Transport-Telecommunications Council on 4 and 5 April when the site of the new European Maritime Safety Agency was being discussed. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, would have to explain the reason he is repeatedly brought before the European Court of Justice for failing to implement agreed environmental directives. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, would have to assess the implications for Ireland of his 16 June signing of the 2001 broad economic policy guidelines and his stated intention to, once again, ignore these guidelines in next budget. The Taoiseach would have to outline the report he agreed to produce at the Gothenburg summit on the debate in Ireland on the future of Europe for the incoming Belgian Presidency, and all future Presidencies.</P>
    <P>The Government and all future Governments would have to inform the Oireachtas about their negotiating stances on legislative proposals as well as major upcoming developments. The Oireachtas would have a clear idea of what is on the agenda of forthcoming Council meetings, what positions Ministers or civil servants plan to take or have taken, what is contained in the Commission's annual legislative programme, what is set out in the work programme of each Council Presidency, and what initiative proposals are planned by the European Parliament etc.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of this Bill is to amend the defence Acts to provide for participation by the Defence Forces im the European Union's rapid reaction force, but only where the RRF is operating under a UN mandate. It is not enough for the Government to say it will clarify this, it must change the legislation if it is to reassure the people on this matter. It must be clear that a UN mandate is required before Ireland can participate in missions undertaken by the rapid reaction force. The Government should be able to accept these sections of the Bill given that it already claims this is the legal position.</P>
    <P>I want to respond to the remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night when he said that all parties have sought to develop a social Europe &ndash; that is not the case. One of the most common criticisms made during the Nice treaty referendum was that today's Europe is not the same as the Europe that Ireland joined in 1973. I, for one, am very happy that that is the case &ndash; that we have moved on, that both Ireland and Europe have developed. For many conservatives, Europe was acceptable when it largely confined <Col N="599" /> itself to lowering trade barriers and providing funds to develop our infrastructure, but it is a completely different ball game when Europe starts talking about letting workers know what their employers are saying in the boardroom, and asking the Government to justify the progress, or lack of it, towards meeting anti-poverty targets, implement agreed environment directives or stick to agreements made with other countries to co-ordinate economic policy.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that most of the Eurosceptic comments emanating from Ministers in the last year have largely come from its individualistic low-tax, limited public services wing, which incidentally did not participate in this debate. This wing deliberately uses emotive phrases such as &ldquo;superstate&rdquo;, &ldquo;Boston not Berlin&rdquo; and &ldquo;700 years of oppression&rdquo;. I thought Sinn Féin was the only one to continue to trot out these hoary old chestnuts. This simplistic analysis is a deliberate misrepresentation of what Europe is trying to achieve &ndash; to build on the creation of a single market, a single currency and turn Europe into the world's most competitive economy and &ndash; this is the point the Minister left out last night &ndash; the world's most cohesive society. Other states have done it such as Sweden and France. It needs to be borne in mind that Europe is not just a market &ndash; it is a political and social union. It is about the people of Europe having a decent life and trying to ensure people in the rest of the world also have a decent life and that we can make a contribution. We can contribute to ensuring that peace prevails in the world as well as in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation. I have been fortunate to speak on much legislation in the Dáil over the past 12 months, but this is a Bill about which I have mixed feelings. There are some very important aspects to it but it is unfortunate the Government has decided to include others. My views on this issue are based primarily on my experience as a member of Laois County Council for the past two years. I have dealt with the midlands waste management plan, which was to cover the counties of Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath and North Tipperary. Most people find the inclusion of North Tipperary in the overall strategy unusual but I will deal with that in due course.</P>
      <P>One of the Bill's main provisions is to give effect to the European Council Directive of 15 July 1975, the Council Directive of 18 March 1991 and the Council Directive of 22 April 1999. In view of the debate on the Private Members' Bill, it would be far more beneficial to tease out these issues in detail on Committee Stage. We have all learned during recent debates that it is important there be a full discussion and understanding of these matters and that people do not feel there is an overbearing, big brother attitude from the Council of Europe. We need to give greater attention to these issues because it is a matter of concern to most people that the Commission is taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice on the implementation of waste management provisions. It is possible that if we are found not to be fulfilling our obligations we may be fined in due course. I am concerned if that happens the European Commission will be seen as heavy-handed and threatening. If that is how Europe is perceived we will have to ensure people have a more positive view of Council directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To set this debate in a European context, I have figures which derive from the Commission and the Council of the European Parliament on the implementation of community waste legislation. This information covers all 15 countries and is the data on domestic and municipal waste management practices within the EU. The overall figures, taking the European Union as a whole, show that 14.4% of waste is being recycled, 19.6% is going for thermal treatment or incineration and 62.8% is going to landfill, with 2.9% going elsewhere. We are not as out of line with the European percentage use of landfill as some would have us believe. There is a very high level of thermal treatment and recycling facilities in some countries but when one looks at the Union it is correct to say that two thirds of all domestic and municipal waste goes to landfill. The figures here are obviously much higher. We are not as industrialised a country and we are not as short of space. It is not unnatural that we would have <Col N="601" /> had a higher reliance on landfill in view of our easier access to land for such facilities than other countries.</P>
    <P>I move on to the various regional waste plans that have been drawn up by local authorities. Looking at the midlands waste management plan covering the counties I mentioned, it is proposed that 46% of waste be recycled, 36% go for thermal treatment and 17% go for landfill. Roughly the same percentages are proposed for the north east, the Dublin region, Connacht, the south west, Wicklow and Donegal. There is a relative uniformity of approach in the reports presented to local authorities to inform the regional plans and, in one or two cases, county plans. There is a high level of consistency but the process of local authorities coming together voluntarily to draw up regional plans has been a sorry saga. It was not founded on a proper understanding of the roles of local authorities and councils. Council members did not fully understand the impact they could have on these processes. Most people approached the plans county by county even though they were regionally based. The fact that some areas have not been able to agree their plans while others agreed theirs under duress is an indication that there was insufficient education on this matter in the first instance. We have tried for many years to deal with the problem of waste and stop it all going to landfill.</P>
    <P>When we look at the waste hierarchy it is obvious that the most important step is to prevent waste, then minimise it, reuse and recycle, then energy recovery and thermal treatment, what most people call incineration. What was proposed in many of the regional plans was pure incineration. There was no element of energy recovery in some of the regional plans and I speak specifically for the midlands. Ultimately some of the waste has to go to landfill. I accept that there is no such concept as zero waste. It is a simplistic solution some people put forward but life is much more difficult than that. We must embark on a major process of education, starting with the younger generation in the schools who will help to educate the rest of us. Some of the older generation will not change their ways on these matters as Government would like them to. These are cultural matters and cannot be legislated for and what is a long-term problem requires a long-term-solution.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that section 4 will generate much controversy. Maybe there is no other option but it is regrettable that we must deal with this section.</P>
    <P>Maybe local authority members did not fulfil their responsibilities. However, I want to defend members of councils. Section 4, which gives county managers legal authority to draw up waste management plans for regions, removes power from elected members and that will have a knock-on effect. It seems a simplistic solution. I remember that the function relating to the Traveller issue was also removed from elected members and given to county managers and it has made no <Col N="602" /> appreciable difference as we still have a problem in this regard. In reality county managers cannot operate in isolation from the elected members in any case, so that while the plan might go through and the manager may have statutory power, that will not make the delivery of the plan on the ground any more acceptable to the community. If we are to avoid EU penalties we will have to show we have such plans in place and perhaps this is the way to do so but signing a plan will not make waste management happen on the ground.</P>
    <P>My single greatest complaint regarding everyone who has been involved in this debate relates to the consultants who drew up these regional waste management plans. They did a bad job and presented bad reports after poor levels of public consultation. They did not bring members with them and this will go down as one of the worst exercises of its type.</P>
    <P>I want specific answers. They may not relate to this specific Bill but they will come to be answered. Somewhere along the line the Comptroller and Auditor General or the local government auditor should look at the costs incurred by local authorities to date in drawing up their regional plans as one will find a gross waste of taxpayers' money. I cannot understand how almost every county councillor and journalist in the country was offered free, fully funded trips abroad to look at incineration plants. They did not look at recycling plants, properly managed landfills or areas where waste is being reduced; they were brought to incineration plants by and large. I estimate the cost for that running to hundreds of thousands of pounds. It was an effort by the consultants to soften up the elected members to accept proposals for incineration. As a person who always looks at financial matters, I feel the cost for that will come out some day and there will be a proper debate.</P>
    <P>How much were those consultants paid who were working in areas which did not finalise their plans? How much were they paid for bringing forward a plan that was unacceptable to the community? Will they be paid in full? The same consultants are involved in many of the areas experiencing difficulties; could they have done a better job? If so, they should not get the full payment. This should be revisited on another day, as we got a bad return for that investment and it should be addressed properly in the future.</P>
    <P>People might think I am being severe on the consultants but it is right to do so. We are now finding in relation to other projects, such as motorways, that if there is not full public consultation and engagement, we will not get a satisfactory conclusion. We did not have that in this process and perhaps the consultants need to learn. I think they came with templates to each region and that they only changed the front covers on the regional reports while what they proposed for different regions was consistent across the board and did not address local circumstances. If I am being critical of these consultants I feel entitled to be and I will continue to be because if we are <Col N="603" /> not getting value for taxpayers' money we should highlight it here. They are the principal reason we are here with this legislation; the plans were not adopted at regional level because the consultants did a bad job. If they had gone about their work in a more inclusive way and educated people, they would have brought the people with them. People would have understood the issues better and they would not have had the same fears; some of those are justified but others may not be.</P>
    <P>The midland region report did not carry one word, sentence, paragraph, page or chapter dealing with health, despite all the concerns expressed by the public about the potential impact on health. When we quizzed our consultants they blandly told us that it was a matter for the Department of Health and Children and that the EPA would issue licences, so it was not a matter for the local authority as ours was not a health authority. No wonder consultants' reports ran into trouble when they did not print one word about the potential effects or otherwise on health. They dodged the issue and that is why some of these reports are being rejected. Those consultants should not be paid; they almost have to pay a surcharge for the extra costs the country is having to incur by passing this legislation and in many cases they should be forced back through the process again. I will absolutely oppose the concept of any of the consultants involved in the project to date being reappointed to complete any of these plans anywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>The departmental officials should take that into account and ask themselves why we are in this sorry mess today. We are not here because the Minister of State is trying to put the jackboot to local authority members and we are not here because local authority members have failed in their duty. Those members are responsible people like everyone else. Something went wrong in the system and much of the difficulty relates to how consultants presented their reports. We were given deadlines and told that we would have to accept these reports as each was a <i>fait accompli.</i> Amendments were resisted as we were told if one county made an amendment it would impact on a neighbouring county and if both did not make the same amendment it would not be valid across the region, hence every area was tied. The process was weak and flawed and I hope we have learnt a lesson for the future. The consultants have a lot to answer for as they are not the experts they put themselves forward as being.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, waste management starts with schools and children. I am particularly pleased that the Brigidine convent in Mountrath and Heywood community school, my former secondary school, have recently received green flags; that is the way of the future. I have encouraged pupils in those two schools to go back to their national schools with the green flag lessons so that children can start learning them and bringing them home to their parents.</P>
    <P>I also highlight Atlas Oil in Portlaoise, which <Col N="604" /> was visited by the renowned David Bellamy, as it is recycling contaminated soil from building sites around the country. It has a small facility in Portlaoise and it is making great strides in developing new technology to clean out contaminated soil so it can be reused.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the cost of taking waste to a landfill; at present it is £50 per tonne in Laois, which means a 20 tonne lorry of refuse costs £1,000 to take to the local landfill. That results in illegal dumping from construction and demolition sites. Local authorities must be vigilant and determined to go after those dumping illegally.</P>
    <P>The legislation mentions the EPA and I look forward to new legislation dealing with that body as I have only had one experience with it in Laois. It was a sorry experience as the EPA gave a licence to Bord na Móna to carry out work in a bog in Laois but no notice in respect of the work appeared locally. The EPA said it put an advertisement in the Bord na Móna head office in Offaly. Nobody in Laois would have a chance of seeing that. Notices should appear on every site and the legislation dealing with the EPA in this regard is flawed; that body told me it complied with the letter of the law. It might have complied with the letter of the law in issuing that licence but it did not comply with the spirit of it. I look forward to the protection of our environment and to dealing with waste management because these landfill sites have proper licences from the EPA. Public confidence in the EPA in County Laois has been shattered in recent months because it did not insist that a site notice appear on every site in respect of areas where licences were given to carry out certain activities.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle has become a cliché. Who is the polluter? It is thought that if people buy a box of cornflakes they are the polluter because they end up with the box. In fact, it is the person who produces that box who is the polluter. The end-user is not the producer of that pollution. The emphasis must change to ensure we do not produce the level of waste and packaging that we have in the past.</P>
    <P>Like many in Ireland, I condemn President George Bush for his breaches of the Kyoto agreement and the principles agreed in Rio de Janeiro by various Heads of State on global warming. He has taken a short-sighted view that looks no further than the balance sheet of particular companies. Protecting the environment is more important than that. David Bellamy visited Laois recently and I would like George Bush to sit and listen to him for an hour.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ulick Burke, by agreement. I am concerned about this Bill. At a time when we are looking at local authority reform the Bill does the opposite. We are interfering with and undermining democracy by removing powers from elected councillors in relation to waste management. One of the present buzz topics is ensuring that local government is strengthened. However, we are taking powers from local government and allocating them to management. We are giving county managers the power to over-ride local development plans in the siting of waste facilities.</P>
      <P>The impact of landfill is well known and should be ameliorated by a strong programme of waste reduction, recycling and composting. Composting has the potential to remove all biodegradable material from landfill material which means that the source of methane &ndash; the greenhouse gas &ndash; is eliminated. Removal of biodegradable waste also reduces the hazardous aspect of leachate. The separation and removal of all hazardous material from the waste stream, both household and industrial, will eliminate the problem of heavy metals and other pollutants from the landfill site.</P>
      <P>This morning I received a phone call from a constituent living adjacent to a landfill site in Gortadroma in County Limerick. In the past two years, I have received in excess of 60 individual complaints with regard to the management of this landfill site. The complaint told of noxious odours from the site, bird infestation and litter on land. Over the years there have been many difficulties with odours from this landfill site and a difficulty with flies, including bluebottle infestation in summer. Limerick County Council had to take action to tackle the bird infestation but it continues. There is a concern with health in the area and it is unacceptable that any community should be visited with this type of difficulty. There should be a time limit within which this community should not have to tolerate these difficulties.</P>
      <P>Limerick County Council decided unanimously some months ago that this site should have a life of an extra five years. The county manager has now decided that he will extend the site, purchase extra land and continue using the site into the future. This is against the wishes of the people and the councillors. It is wrong and anti-democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to a letter from a Teagasc advisor written in the past two years with regard to a farm in that area. It says that on 20 April 1999, the land was strewn with litter which had blown in from the council landfill site. The litter was plastic and tinfoil and was not biodegradable. Due to the state of the land, it was dangerous to put animals on it at the time. Much of the rubbish had been trampled into the ground by livestock and the land contained tinfoil, plastic, bones and even glass fragments. How can a farm be operated in such circumstances? The views of the people, expressed through their public representatives, should be listened to. This Bill further removes the power of local representatives to bring the <Col N="606" /> concerns of the public to the council and to respond to those views.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about incineration. A Greenpeace research document which is a scientific study of the impacts of waste incinerators on human health cites numerous scientific studies carried out in the UK, US and Sweden among other countries. It reveals that where studies into health impacts of incinerators have been conducted, waste incineration is associated with definite hazards to human health such as lung, throat, liver and respiratory problems, and heart disease. The data also reveal that despite a reduction in some chemicals in the stack emissions, even modern incinerators release numerous toxic substances into the atmosphere and into residues such as fly ash and bottom ash, often in increased concentrations.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced by the many statements, often by consultants, that incineration is free of risk to human health. We should remember the 1970s when there was a row in Ireland between environmentalists who wanted the Government to focus its efforts on energy conservation measures such as double glazing and insulating housing. The engineering consultants of the time wanted the Government to go for a high-tech solution, a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point, regardless of the inherent risks of nuclear power and its dangerous by-product, spent uranium.</P>
    <P>Today environmentalists want the Government to focus on waste reduction such as reuse, recycling and composting. The engineering consultants want to go for the high-tech solution, incineration, regardless of the inherent risks involved in a process which I am not convinced does not create dioxins. If we are not convinced, how can we agree to have incinerators in our areas? The Irish Doctors' Environmental Association issued a statement in 1999 which stated that it strongly opposed the plans for a waste incinerator in Kilkock and at other proposed sites. The association also indicated that its concerns relate to the adverse health effects from toxic substances in the emissions which, being mainly fat-soluble accumulating body tissues, are concentrated up the food chain, eventually being absorbed by humans through consumption of, for example, cows' milk, meat, fish, eggs, and substantially passed on to the foetus in a higher concentration. It further stated that possible ill effects from this include altered immune responses and disordered endocrine effects such as decreased fertility, lower IQ and cancer.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to an environmental problem in the Askeaton-Ballysteen area which I represent which is affecting animal and human health. In 1996, the then Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Environmental Protection Agency initiated an investigation into the deaths of animals in the area to which I refer. We expected that a report would be published within 18 months to two years. Five years later, however, it has still not emerged. A reply to a question I <Col N="607" /> tabled in late April indicated that the report was being typed and that it would be ready in a matter of weeks. I have lost confidence in the bona fides of this report because it has been stated on several occasions during the years that it would be published within the following six months. I will provide examples.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question tabled on 5 October 1999, it was stated that the report requested on animal health problems in Askeaton was at its concluding stage and the Minister expected it to be published in early 2000. The reply to a further parliamentary question I tabled on 10 February indicated that it would be available in mid-2000. Subsequently, on 27 June 2000 I tabled another question and was informed that it would not be available until the end of October 2000. In November 2000, a further question elicited the response that the report would be available in the first quarter of 2001. It is mid-summer 2001 and it has still not appeared. How can one have confidence in the findings of a report when it is being produced in such circumstances?</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, launched Waste Management, Changing our Ways on 1 October 1998 and it is ironic that almost three years later we are waiting for them to change their ways. I accept that we might be expecting too much. There has been a great deal of discussion about waste management throughout the country. Many members of local authorities with more experience than the Minister cannot understand the reason he and the Minister of State insist that their plan and no other should be used in this area.</P>
      <P>Let us consider some of the statements the Minister and the Minister of State have made in respect of waste management. For example, on one occasion the Minister of State said that Changing Our Ways signals a major shift away from an overwhelming reliance on landfill towards minimisation and recycling and reuse. He also stated that he wanted to force the pace of change by setting ambitious objectives with determination and vigour. We have seen the determination and vigour, but not a great deal more. The Minister and the Minister of State have also emphasised that the achievement of national waste management objectives will require a concerted effort by everyone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> In further statements the Minister and the Minister of State indicated that they look at local authorities as the key players to secure progress in this area. Now, however, they propose to deny local authority members any involvement. According to the Minister, if they make suggestions or propose alterations to plans, it will render them useless.</P>

      <P>I am not. They are denying local elected representatives the opportunity to contribute the process of change. Local councillors from the Minister of State's party vehemently oppose what is being done in this area and a unanimous decision was taken by Galway County Council to reject the waste management plan produced in accordance with the guidelines imposed by the Minister of State and the Minister. Subsequently, the Minister travelled to County Galway, gathered everyone in a room and tried to intimidate them into accepting the plan but, wisely, they rejected it.</P>
      <P>A firm of consultants, M. C. O'Sullivan, has prepared plans for most of the local authorities. Those plans must adhere to a long list of European requirements, from which there can be no deviation. Three sites were selected in my constituency for landfills at Kilrickle, New Inn and Newbridge. Without exception, members of these communities are opposed to the opening of landfills at the sites in question because they believe they could be opened at suitably alternative sites. Members of the council, including myself, are prepared to identify such sites. However, that is not good enough for the Minister. He wants it done his way or not at all.</P>

      <P>We did not make the decision because the proposal is not acceptable. We were informed that we would have to accept the Minister's proposal. That is an unacceptable way to do business in a modern democracy.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council will be obliged to accept waste from five counties if the plan is accepted. Cork County Council will not be subjected to such treatment because it will only have to deal with waste produced within the county's boundaries. In addition to dealing with waste from five counties, Galway will be obliged to accept the construction of an incinerator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has completely ignored the fact that the ash produced by an incinerator will have to be dumped on landfill sites. Will he indicate if this ash will be categorised as hazardous waste? If the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, has the Minister of State consulted the EPA in respect of compliance with European guidelines regarding its disposal? Only 20 years ago people stated there would be no difficulty in disposing of nuclear <Col N="609" /> waste, but many problems have arisen in that regard in the interim. We will not be obliged to wait 20 years until we see the effects of the hazardous waste produced by incinerators.</P>
    <P>How many countries in Europe have stopped building incinerators or will allow no further incinerators to be constructed? I do not know the answer, but we are still being informed that we must abide by European guidelines and provide incinerators. What is wrong with the Minister? When he recovers after a long rest, I hope he will return refreshed and reinvigorated and intent on providing a proper waste management system for this country. The members of the communities concerned about his current proposals will then be in a position to state, &ldquo;He is now prepared to listen to us&rdquo;. Many communities and groups have made some extremely positive suggestions. These groups and the councillors in County Galway to whom I referred are not all negative in their outlook.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 amends section 6 of the 1996 Act by giving the Minister power to allow for a continued and increased volume of waste to come to Ballinasloe, if he so wishes, which is the only open landfill in County Galway. Perhaps we should simply allow Deputy Dempsey to provide the waste and then see his mistakes. It is unacceptable to the people of Ballinasloe who, under pressure, will take Galway city's waste until 2005. This Bill takes the easy option by allowing the Minister to extend the time and quantity of waste if he wishes. There is one other similar case. Is that democracy? There is time to reassess this. The Minister insists that if we do not make a decision the county manager will but that is where he is wrong. County Galway councillors and the executive will not implement his wishes because it is contrary to everything we believe in good planning and waste management. We were not given the opportunity or the finance to help to recycle. It is a success where we do it on our own initiative. That is the way to go. It will take waste from five counties to feed this incinerator which will threaten people's health.</P>

      <P>By agreement I will share my time with Deputy Keaveney. I welcome the chance to discuss what is an emotive and passionate issue. There is an historical neglect by Administrations and local authorities to address the mounting waste problem. We turned a blind eye to the operation of landfills where large volumes of all forms of rubbish were dumped with no EPA licensing system or checks and balances to ensure that only degradable and non-toxic material was deposited. I am concerned about that. We did not recognise or take seriously the responsibilities that we have as public representatives, particularly in local authorities. I am disappointed that some local authority members use this issue for electoral gain.</P>

      <P>It was said that the voices of local authorities should be taken into account when formulating policy. I support local democracy and local authority members having a greater say in policy. However, let us be under no illusions. Show me a councillor who would propose a landfill in his backyard. That will never happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not refer to County Galway but to local authorities in general. It is a fact of life that councillors will not support an electorally dangerous measure. If we had no National Roads Authority, how many motorways would be built? Could we even dream of implementing the national development plan? It would be impossible because very unpopular decisions must be made. In Cork we have difficulties over the site of a materials recovery unit and a landfill. We try to explain to the people, be positive and make difficult decisions. Politics are played with this type of issue at all levels.</P>
      <P>Previous Administrations did not accept that there was a waste problem. Our recycling infrastructure is almost non-existent. Recently efforts were made to redress this but we are starting from a position where recycling is not inherent in our psyche. We are wasteful and are not hygienic in disposing of rubbish. It is unacceptable that at the most scenic spots, byroads and main roads, we see chip bags and papers, newspapers, burnt out cars and tyres. It is not for local authorities to pick up people's rubbish. They must take responsibility for their own areas. Even people in impoverished European countries are more conscious about keeping their environs clean, outside their houses, on the footpaths and the roads. Here we think that it is someone else's problem, the local authority's or the Government's. It is all our problem. Efforts were made in recent years to increase environmental awareness in schools for which I commend the Minister. If we want to ensure change for the next generation we must begin in the schools.</P>
      <P>Fines should be dramatically increased, especially for large scale dumping such as putting a plastic bag of household rubbish over a ditch. Such a person should be fined at least £500 and community service should be imposed. It would be a positive step to consider community service for litter louts on Committee Stage. We have not tackled this head on. Massive resources are applied to changing people's perception of drink driving and other matters, but litter is not tackled seriously. I urge the Minister to examine an increase in fines and community service for those who breach the litter laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incineration is emotive as are landfill and materials recovery. We must be brave, challenging and ask people to consider the problems of waste disposal in a cold calculating way. Many turn a blind eye to the fact that European countries, some of them models in strict environmen<Col N="611" /> tal regulation, use incineration successfully. If it is properly explained and the public realise the benefits brought by modern technology and research in other countries, including their mistakes, we can take a brave leap forward with incineration. In Cork, we propose a landfill and a materials recovery unit. Wherever it is eventually situated it will be successful and we will be able to address our waste problem for the next 20 to 25 years as a county. Other counties will have to make difficult decisions and follow suit.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the powers of the manager and associated fears, I have always been an advocate of giving more power to local authority members. That should be encouraged. This could be put in the same context as a planning issue. Nobody demands that a local authority member should have a say in where an IDA centre, a house extension or a landfill should go. I do not see any difficulty in moving and transferring this particular function from local authority members to management. The reason we have to move it is because local authority members have not had the ability to grasp the issue and make decisions that are in the interest of the public, not the ballot box.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is unfortunate that it needed to be brought forward at all. As one Labour Party leader in England said years ago, &ldquo;There was a shiver running around the room looking for a spine to run up&rdquo;. We have had that attitude in regard to addressing the waste issue. We all turned our heads and hoped the issue would go away but it has not. We have mounting waste and threats of leaving bags of rubbish on the streets in tourist towns throughout the country. That is not good enough. I suggest that councillors can still make decisions through support of the manager and consensus. Many of the requirements of the 1996 legislation were not met and now we must bring forward further legislation to ensure we can bring forward a coherent waste management strategy that will benefit everybody.</P>
    <P>The education of young people on environmental issues is something we must support. It is important that we use imaginative ways of promoting environmental awareness. Young people are very impressionable and sports and music industry figures with charisma should be used to push this. No matter how much we like ourselves, as politicians, young people are more impressed by their modern idols. I have encouraged this type of promotion with regard to under-age drinking and abuse of tobacco and drugs. This approach would be innovative and could be successful in capturing young people's imaginations, especially in conjunction with the national competitions being run in schools.</P>
    <P>I welcome the broad provisions of the Bill. It is disappointing that we have had to bring it forward because of the fact that people shirked their responsibilities through shortsightedness. This Bill is in everybody's interest. I suggest to the Minister that he look at the idea of community <Col N="612" /> service as a mandatory penalty for those convicted of offences under the Litter Act. I wish the Bill well and look forward to Committee Stage next week when I hope these issues will be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to speak on the extremely important issue of waste management. It affects all of us no matter how we look at it and we all have a choice to make. We can choose prevention through minimisation, reuse and recycling and find an environmentally sustainable method of disposal of waste which cannot be prevented or recovered, or we can choose the route chosen by a small percentage which reflects badly on our country, towns, villages and rural landscape.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point that waste management begins and ends with each one of us. It is our own personal decision to let a match fall to the ground, a crisp packet blow out a window, throw a Coke can into a ditch or leave behind us the remains of a picnic or a dirty nappy on a beach. Too often we are inclined to say it is someone else's issue. Part of the problem arises from the affluence of society where people seem to assume there is someone coming after them with some sort of magic hoover that will clear away the rubbish. It is probably a minority but each one of us may contribute to it and we must decide to change.</P>
      <P>One of the most important projects introduced has been the &ldquo;green flag&rdquo; initiative. I congratulate the Minister on his continuing support. A small number of schools on Inishowen have managed to achieve green flag status, are tremendously excited and proud of it and the envy of many other schools. The last school to which I was invited on achieving its green flag was the school in Whitecastle near my home town. The school's project looked at the issue of plastic bags. This tiny school in a tiny community decided to reduce by one the number of plastic bags coming home after each visit to the shop. Once the children were involved parents were forced to become involved. Parents involved other siblings and then the shops became involved. Not just hundreds, but thousands of plastic bags were saved from use by this initiative. The teachers, pupils, families and extended community were shocked by its impact. It is beyond time that we imposed a charge on plastic bags and it is important that people realise that they do not need a plastic bag just because they went to the shop. Plastic bags are thrust at us when we buy an item, whether it is the newspaper or something more substantial, even when we might only be going a few yards from the shop to the car. It is time it became less convenient to have plastic bags readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a return to some old practices of rewards for returns. I remember as a young girl scavenging and scrounging around for return bottles in order to get extra pocket money by returning them to the shops. The same principle <Col N="613" /> could be applied to plastic bags. Something needs to be done in terms of incentives instead of always using the big stick approach. The best example of the motivation of children which I saw as a secondary school student and teacher was when a company asked for drink cans to be brought in to a local supermarket. The more cans brought in, the more money was earned. As I recall, this money was contributed to the Irish Wheelchair Association, or some other wheelchair organisation. A huge number of children latched on to this idea. They probably drank four times as many cans of soft drinks as normal, which might not be good in itself, but all those cans were brought back and recycled. It was a very good concept. There are many things that can catch the imagination.</P>
    <P>We have much to learn from national schools. We often complain about children dropping litter, but perhaps they are the best informed of all. In my area there are environmental groups with glas óige members who work very hard in getting the message of a clean environment across. I get very annoyed at hillsides being destroyed with plastic bags and abandoned cars. The beaches are destroyed with nappies and everything from bags to cars. We need more litter wardens and more prosecutions. County Donegal is not a good example as regards prosecutions for littering. If we are to develop tourism, we must have clean counties, towns and villages. I congratulate Donegal County Council on having done a lot of work for communities in terms of providing skips for community clean-ups. Its waste station has been second to none. I would like to think that its costs could be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>A large number of people in Inishowen have asked me about the provision of bottle banks. They are crying out for ones which need to be replaced and ones which have not yet been provided. The way in which these people are thinking is a healthy sign. I am less happy with the response of the council in providing these facilities, it claims that there are implications in terms of costs. What is the point in having a waste management plan if it will not be implemented? We often talk about the beautiful mountains in this country, but our problem is that we have more mountains of rubbish than we should. It is not an insurmountable problem. We could start here in the Houses where we use a phenomenal amount of paper on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Each one of us has a role to play in establishing that rubbish is not cool. The more we can highlight this issue the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Gerry Reynolds and Browne<i> (Carlow-Kilkenny).</i>It gives me no great pleasure to speak on this Bill. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, made the great promise that he would reform local government. He is not like the Meath football team, they delivered on their promises while he has faded away and is a disaster. He promised that he would <Col N="614" /> bring power and local government back to the people but what has he done? He has taken away the powers of local representatives and given them to county managers in the sphere of waste management.</P>
      <P>County managers are not elected by anybody. They remind me of EU Commissioners who are not elected by anybody either. The people spoke in the recent referendum and said that they are sick and tired of having faceless people, who are not elected by them and do not represent them, telling them how their lives should change. Deputy Kelleher, like all politicians in this House, seems to forget that we are elected by the people and are their messengers. Civil servants will still be in place after the next election, and the one after it, whether they do a good job. Some county managers have seven year contracts while others have contracts that mean they cannot be removed.</P>
      <P>The Minister let elected public representatives down when he took powers away from local councils. He should have left them with the people and their representatives. The county manager, regardless of the county development plan, planning or anything else, can decide where he wants to have landfill sites, incinerators or other waste facilities located. That is an insult to the people. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, have let down the people who elected them. They have let down the grass roots who think it is worthwhile to cast their vote. They elect us to this House and what do we do? We take powers away from elected members, both of this House and county councils, and give them to county managers. Every county manager, county secretary and county assistant manager should have to stand for election. If they did, we would not have the same number elected for a second term. It should be like the American system where they should have to face the people.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that, as elected Members of this House, we are told we have to obey European legislation and county managers. If a Member tables a Dáil question about a local authority, the Minister will reply that he has no control over county managers or county councils. How true that is, they are uncontrollable. Deputy Kelleher spoke about the planning system. There should be a planning system in place where the public, public representatives and officials adjudicate on every application. Why should a planner educated in Belfast or Dublin &ndash; they all have different views and ideas &ndash; tell ordinary people what they should and should not have in relation to planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of waste management, why do we always put the pressure on the consumer? Why do we not put the pressure on Coca Cola, Guinness or Tayto? When I was a child the milkman would come on his bike, a bottle would be brought out to him and filled with milk. That cannot be done anymore, now the milk would be seen as diseased. Those milkmen, small abattoirs and small suppliers have been put out of business. <Col N="615" /> The philosophy has been to get rid of the small fellow and leave it to the big fellow. Why not tackle Coca Cola and make it reintroduce recyclable bottles? Children used to collect Coke, Guinness and milk bottles, bring them to shops and get two or three pence for their troubles. If that was done now, there would not be as many bottles on the streets or roadsides. That kind of rubbish destroyed the countryside.</P>
    <P>The policy is always to aim for the easy target, the consumer. If one were to build a house, one would want to set aside a room in it for rubbish. That is the way things have gone, it is daft. Who has to pay for this? The answer is the consumer. Why not tax the big companies? If taxes were levied on Guinness, Coca Cola, Pepsi or Tayto, they would come up with something that would stop people littering our streets.</P>
    <P>Last year in County Mayo prices were increased for use of landfill dumps. The rubbish from homes in rural parts was collected by private contractors which could not compete with the county council. The county council took the easiest option at the best price and went into the big housing estates. Private operators were put out of business as a result of the price increases. The small person was left without a service. We have a lot to learn in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill. I am conscious that waste management is one of the most serious issues of our time and the most serious affecting local government. The way in which it has been dealt with by the Government in the past four years has been abysmal. It is wrong and fundamentally flawed to bring in legislation to remove the democratic right of public representatives to make decisions. As local and national public representatives, we find it difficult to express the role we have to play in the future of this country. We stand at elections so we may become legislators and decision makers. If the Government does not have confidence in the ability of public representatives to make decisions, locally and nationally, democracy will encounter difficulties. There will be a greater sense of apathy if we continue to take power from public representatives and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why this legislation is necessary or why it is being introduced. As a public representative I know we have difficult decisions to make but if they are not made soon we will encounter a crisis. Waste management is already in crisis. I have no difficulty in putting my head on the block to decide whether there should <Col N="616" /> be thermal treatment, incineration, landfill or recycling. I do not think one has to be a genius to know that the public wants as much recycling as possible. Only 40% of waste can be recycled so what are we to do with the other 60%? Should we throw it into the air and hope it goes away? As public representatives we must sell this issue. The Government has a specific responsibility in that regard, but it has failed to get its message across.</P>
    <P>During the debate in this House prior to the referendum on the Nice treaty, I said that our desire to see the treaty accepted by the electorate would not be met if we did not sell our message. The treaty was rejected. We face the same situation with the structure of waste management. A number of bodies are anti-landfill, anti-thermal treatment and anti-incineration, but the Government has sat on its hands instead of trying to put its case. It should set down the terms of its policies.</P>

      <P>Another issue I feel strongly about in this area and which has become apparent in recent years is refuse collection charges. Those living in rural Ireland pay such charges, which is proper. The county I represent has 750 rate payers, the lowest number in Ireland. We have to ask the general public to pay refuse charges which have increased by 100% in the past 12 months. Many elderly people find it difficult to pay them. We cannot provide a landfill site in County Leitrim so must ask other counties to allow us to use their facilities. Because Dublin is the largest city in the country with the largest population and a large rate base, people living there do not have to pay refuse charges. It is not an easy matter to decide on, but it is unfair that the weak have to pay the charges while the strong do not because they can generate income in other ways.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to sell the message so that we will be able to put a proper waste management strategy in place.</P>

        <b>:</b> Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar an mBille seo, ag moladh agus ag fáil locht leis na rudaí atá ann agus nach bhfuil ann. It has been pointed out that section 4 presents a major dilemma for the Fianna Fáil dissidents who were so vocal last week about their right to be paid at the same level as councillors. Four Independent Members almost brought down the Government in an attempt to remain on local authorities. This Bill tells them they are dummies and that it does not make any difference whether they are on local authorities as the manager will do their work for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is make or break time for the Deputies to whom I have referred as if they have it both ways, they are the real Tadhg an dá thaobh. They want to be on councils and insist on being there, but managers will now do the work and make the decisions so local representatives can sit back. It will be interesting to see what happens. Giving managers such power also helps those on councils who make their names by attending public pro<Col N="618" /> test meetings. They will be able to back objections to incinerators or landfill sites and if the projects go ahead they will be able to say that if they had the power they would not have allowed it to happen. They will have a field day by being against pollution but also against every solution to it. They will have the best of both worlds and we can do without them.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Reynolds, said that politicians have to show enough backbone to make decisions. I have no objection to voting for or against proposals as that is what politicians are elected to do. The public must be informed of how public representatives stand on issues. Those who try to get out of situations by having two different stories and by being on two different sides, which is quite common, should be run out of the country. Politicians should go one way or the other, be prepared to take the flak that may result and defend what has been done. The electorate is entitled to take whatever action it wishes if it does not like what its representatives do.</P>
    <P>We have heard so much about recycling that it is almost becoming a bad word. Recycling, to paraphrase Shakespeare, is more honoured in the breach than in the observance. It is time that something was done about it as we have been talking about it for too long. Small but welcome measures have been taken, such as the introduction of bottle banks in every town in County Carlow. A colleague of the Minister of State made a good point about paper used in this House. A huge amount of paper is used throughout the country, including acres of newsprint. It is time that we made a decent effort at recycling paper and others have suggested that we subsidise those prepared to do so. It is time that the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, introduced a subsidy for firms that recycle paper.</P>
    <P>It is not known how many trees are cut down. Reams of paper are produced and dumped in landfill sites. If the paper were shredded properly it could be used in stables and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said 90% of waste goes into landfills but this could be prevented by recycling. Could a major study be conducted in Ireland by medical experts on the dangers, if any, of incinerators? Protesters attending anti-incinerator meetings quote experts in Japan, France and Canada and if somebody has a different view he or she is wrong. Could a medical team be established to ascertain the dangers of incineration? Colleagues who have visited various countries as part of parliamentary delegations were amazed that incinerators had been built in the middle of cities and towns and were operating well. Other people have come back from the same places and claimed the incinerators emit toxins in order to frighten people. A serious study should be conducted on the potential dangers of incineration.</P>
    <P>The green flag scheme for primary schools was mentioned. The Minister of State presented an award under the scheme to Oleighlin national school in Carlow earlier. I taught for 28 years and during my career bosca bruscair were placed <Col N="619" /> everywhere in the school and the school yard was always kept tidy. However, one wonders when children become adults whether they consider littering to be a form of protest. Adults leave towns and cities littered with rubbish at weekends and it is like the Battle of Dunkirk on Sunday mornings in some town and city centres. What is the justification for it?</P>
    <P>It is time individuals carried the can in regard to pollution. People should be held responsible for throwing litter around. I have advocated the introduction of fines for littering for years. It is the only measure that will have any impact on preventing people from doing so. The more fines that are imposed the better because some people do not bat an eyelid when they throw rubbish on the streets or out of a car and so on. I do not know what businesses can do to help because every individual has a responsibility to look after his or her own litter. If one has a picnic at the seaside, one should not leave rubbish on the sand afterwards.</P>
    <P>Schemes such as floral pride, which is promoted by Carlow County Council, are marvellous. There is a superb member on the council who co-ordinates the tidy towns competition in towns and villages in County Carlow and the <i>Entente Florale</i>, in which Leighlinbridge will represent Ireland this year. Such schemes give people a sense of pride in their surroundings and they help immensely to create a spirit of cleanliness and tidiness. They are an antidote to litter pollution in many areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the levy on plastic bags. I do not know how it will work in practice but often when one buys a newspaper in a shop, the shop assistant puts it into a plastic bag before one has an opportunity to stop him or her. There is too much plastic in circulation and I welcome anything that minimises its use.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Collins. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation and on waste management generally. Deputy Browne referred to litter awareness in primary schools. It is more than 20 years since I left primary school but at the time a great effort was put into litter awareness and encouraging young children to be more environmentally-friendly and look after their localities. Ireland has not improved one iota over the past 20 years in regard to litter pollution.</P>
      <P>People had a tendency in the past to dump old scrap cars in farmers' yards and fields. This phenomenon dissipated but it has been replaced by the dumping of bale wrap and plastic bags of every description. I welcome the provision of an anti-litter tariff on plastic bags. The only ways to ensure people will become environmentally-friendly and will not litter the countryside are to fine them or introduce a tax. I also welcome the clarification regarding on-the-spot litter fines in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many farmers have dumps in the corner of a <Col N="620" /> field. However, I am delighted officials of Cork County Council are visiting these farmers even though the dumps are on their lands and asking them to stop dumping or risk a fine. We must get tough on litter and the Government and the Oireachtas must send a message that we will no longer accept litter strewn streets on Sunday mornings in town and city centres. Litter pollution must be stamped out and we must send a strong message that it is no longer acceptable.</P>
    <P>Up to a few years ago smoking was allowed in public buildings and on public transport but nowadays this is frowned upon and one can only smoke in designated areas. We should get tough and introduce anti-pollution measures to ensure the polluter pays.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines various ways to dispose of waste, whether through incinerators, thermal treatment plants or landfill sites. It must be accepted that tough decisions must be made to ensure the facilities are in place throughout the State to tackle the waste we generate. It is not possible to minimise waste through recycling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this motion tonight and thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, for coming here to reply.</P>
      <P>This issue is ongoing. The Government has indicated for some time it will implement this scheme. It is now the end of the school year and we are talking about the transfer of funding at the beginning of September. It is not good enough that school authorities do not know the amount involved other than the global figure of £45 million. A number of secretaries, caretakers and school assistants are involved in these worthwhile schemes. The Minister has not indicated if each school will be allocated its grant on a <i>per capita </i> basis. If that is the case, will the Minister of State indicate the exact amount <i>per capita</i> each school will get? If the global figure of £45 million is divided up, it will mean approximately £10,000 per school. That is a totally unsatisfactory position for school board management and operators of the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the situation as regards FÁS? We know the Minister, Deputy Harney, does not like it and it is the policy of her party. The Minister of State's party, the main party in the Government, is going along with it. What is her policy on community employment schemes? These schemes are being abolished slowly but surely. Small schools are being affected. Will the health services be affected next? Will the Minister of State acknowledge that people with disabilities <Col N="621" /> are being denied personal assistants? I hope he denies that is happening. Will the environment also be affected? It is totally unsatisfactory as we face into 1 September. Will supervisors be made redundant? School assistants and the others involved in schools are part of the delivery of a good service.</P>
    <P>There will be a shortfall in terms of funding, according to the figures available to us unless the Minister of State tells us otherwise. There will be a major shortfall in terms of facilities and personnel available to school management. The alternative to paying current labour market wages, which is what the Minister wants to do, is the community employment scheme. Schools do not have the capacity to make up that shortfall. I will give the Minister of State one example of a small school. There are 101 disadvantaged children and 32 non-nationals in an infant school which has 290 four to seven year old students. The total amount for that school which has a secretary, who is not on the community employment scheme, four classroom assistants and one caretaker, would be £72,000. The grants available amount to £16,000. The shortfall for that school in September will be £56,000. That is unacceptable. Such funding is beyond the reach of most schools. It is time the Minister for Education and Science knew the exact amounts and told the schools. The Government must decide how it will bridge the gap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently approximately 33,500 participants on community employment. As a result of the restructuring of the programme in 1999, the numbers employed on community employment are reducing over a five year period from an average provision of 37,500 in 1999 down to 28,000 by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>In the context of the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, consultations have been taking place with the social partners through the PPF standing committee on the labour market on the mainstreaming of essential services currently provided by CE programmes. The number of long-term unemployed persons available to participate in community employment has reduced dramatically in recent years, partially due to the success of community employment and similar reintegration programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions with the Department of Education and Science about school services are at an advanced stage and it is intended to begin the mainstreaming process and transfer CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to that Department in time for the next school year in September. The proposed mainstreaming of CE services will provide an increase in funding for schools over and above the additional resources already allocated by the Department of Education and Science for schools support services in the past year. School services <Col N="622" /> will, after an appropriate transition period, be solely the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>CE projects providing school services, which include secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants, will have participant levels reduced as a direct result of mainstreaming as it will no longer be possible for schools to avail of the CE programme to provide these services. However, it is intended that all such persons who opt to serve out their contracts will be facilitated in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also envisaged that a liaison group will be established comprising representatives of FÁS and the Department of Education and Science to facilitate a smooth transition. Schools will have the flexibility to employ staff based on the identified needs of the individual schools, including retention of persons currently providing ancillary services. Every effort will be made to ensure this proposal will produce positive outcomes for CE participants and the education sector in general.</P>
      <P>The mainstreaming of services now funded by CE moneys would begin the process of putting these backup services on a proper structured footing for the future. One of the effects of a transfer of funding to the Department of Education and Science would be to remove the anomalies in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services for schools. For instance, certain schools currently have the benefit of secretarial and caretaking services under CE schemes and also receive a grant for such services from the Department of Education and Science, whereas other schools are solely dependent on the grants issued by that Department. Mainstreaming would transfer full responsibility for the funding of schools services to the Department of Education and Science which would ensure a uniform and equitable system of funding for such services. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, will announce precise details of the figures in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the proposed arrangements all schools, including those which have not benefited from CE funding, will receive additional funding. During the transition period some schools will receive the additional funding from the Department of Education and Science while still benefiting from the services of CE participants. CE participants currently working in schools participate in the programme for one year initially and, depending on their age and unem<Col N="623" /> ployment record, may work up to a maximum of three years. My Department intends to ensure due recognition is given to the position of such CE participants' experience in schools in the final proposals.</P>
      <P>Supervisors are employed by the sponsors of projects and these positions are funded by a grant from FÁS. The personnel concerned are not FÁS employees. Supervisors are afforded the same rights and protection under the employment Acts as other workers in the open labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>They are continually leaving the programme to avail of the opportunities that present themselves in the open labour market. However, where possible, supervisors who may be affected by the mainstreaming of schools services will be accommodated on other projects as vacancies arise. In addition, some social economy projects are likely to be in a position to offer employment when they are fully operational. It should be noted that it will be a matter for the social economy enterprise to choose the most suitable person for the position.</P>
      <P>The Department has discussed the issue of supervisors becoming redundant as a result of the mainstreaming of CE services with trade union representatives and with groups of supervisors and will continue to update key stake-holders on developments. Current arrangements allow for FÁS funding for statutory redundancy payments only in cases where it is clear that sponsors are unable to meet these costs. The matter of redundancy payments to supervisors is being considered further in the overall context of the mainstreaming of CE essential services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, for coming into the House to discuss it.</P>
      <P>The closure of Irish Ispat in Haulbowline, east Cork, is a huge blow to the region with a loss of over 400 jobs directly and possibly up to 1,200 or maybe even more indirectly. Obviously this is a major blow to the economy of the region. We are very concerned about the workers who are directly affected and their families. Many of them are on a very good wage. The job they had in the plant was specific to the industry and some of them will find it difficult to be re-employed in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter is to ask the Minister of State to set up a task force to ensure that all State agencies are mobilised in order to maintain employment in the region and to help these workers get other employment. I am also concerned about money that is reportedly owed to workers. As the Minister of State is aware, the notice was very short in this case and I want the <Col N="624" /> Minister of State to tell the House tonight the action the Government is taking to ensure that the rights of these workers will be protected.</P>
    <P>There is also an issue with regard to the future of the plant. The closure of this plant has led to an eyesore in Cork harbour, one of the most beautiful harbours in the world. What will happen about that?</P>
    <P>There will be an impact on suppliers. It is reported that millions of pounds are owed to them and the knock-on effect could be catastrophic for many people. I hope the Minister of State will have some words of comfort and reassurance for the many families affected, the workers who will be without employment and the many companies that might face a bleak future because of this closure.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the action the Government took in the lead-up to the closure? I welcome Deputy Michael Ahern to the House. He has been working very hard on this issue also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter. I support the points he has made. Over the past 20 years, all of us in Cork have faced the possibility of a bleak end to Irish Steel, now Irish Ispat, but when it came it was a tremendous blow to the people of the area. I ask the Minister of State to give assurances, particularly with regard to the pension fund, and also to do everything that is in the power of the Department to ensure that wages, minimum notice and other moneys that are due to the workers will be paid forthwith. I ask him to ensure also that the creditors receive payment because the loss to the area is inestimable. I am sure the Minister of State will ensure that everything that can be done by the Department will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for tabling this matter. I acknowledge also the brief comments by my colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern. That indicates to me that this is an issue which goes beyond party politics and is one about which we are all concerned.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel Limited, and we have discussed this matter here in recent days, was formally owned by the State until it was sold for the nominal consideration of £1 in 1996. It then became known as Irish Ispat Limited. Irish Steel had been making a loss prior to that time and its future viability was in serious doubt. It had run up serious debts and the workforce at the time were facing a bleak future. Under the sale agreement, the State agreed to write off accumulated debts of £17 million and to inject a total of £20 million cash into the enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the announcement by Ispat on 14 June, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, travelled to London on Friday, 22 June and, together <Col N="625" /> with officials from her Department, met senior management of Ispat at its headquarters. The purpose of that meeting was to discuss the threatened closure of the Ispat plant at Haulbowline in County Cork.</P>
    <P>It was made quite clear to the Tánaiste at the meeting that Ispat International considered the Haulbowline plant not to be viable and that steel production there had no future. The Ispat board had made an irreversible decision to close the plant and a meeting of creditors was called for Thursday, 28 June with a view to appointing a liquidator.</P>
    <P>Since 1996 when the State sold its shares in Irish Steel to Ispat, Irish Ispat Limited has been a private company. While the Government regrets very much the closure of the plant and the consequent loss of over 400 jobs, we must accept the decision of the company.</P>
    <P>There is no information currently on the company's debts or the possible impact on creditors who have been called to the creditors' meeting tomorrow, Thursday, 28 June. If or when a liquidator is appointed he or she will take charge of the assets and discharge the liabilities of the company. It will, therefore, be the responsibility of the liquidator to deal with the company's creditors.</P>
    <P>The outstanding debts of the employees in regard to wages, holiday pay, minimum notice, sick pay, etc., or any payments due to the private pension scheme, can be paid from the social insurance fund. Such payments are processed by the liquidator through a scheme which is administered by the Department.</P>
    <P>This is a devastating blow to the workforce and their families. I am aware that many of the workers had put a whole lifetime of work into steel working at Haulbowline. The priority now for the Government is to ensure the availability of alternative employment in the area as has been requested and pursued by the Deputies who raised this matter tonight. In this regard, the Tánaiste and I have already been in touch with the director general and chief executive officers of the development agencies operating in the region.</P>
    <P>Since Ispat's assumption of the operation of the plant in 1996, the FÁS office in the south-west region has had a direct involvement with the company and the workforce. FÁS will immediately establish local interview facilities in Cobh and Carrigaline, provide a flexible approach to each worker in terms of interview and registration for alternative work, commence contact with the workforce with a series of information sessions on employment opportunities in the greater Cork area, and provide training in a range of programmes, including crafts, information technology and construction skills. FÁS has already established a local support group in order to deliver on the range of labour market services that are available.</P>
    <P>I thank Margaret Martin of the Chamber of Commerce in Cobh and the harbour area who got <Col N="626" /> in touch with officials of the Department to offer the assistance of the chamber in whatever way possible. The Cork Development Forum, which was established about five years ago and operates under the auspices of the chamber, will be a major force in the drive to secure new enterprises in the area. The forum is a widely representative group including the Cork County and City Managers, the regional directors of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and the President of UCC, among many others. Its mission statement is to support the development of the Cork area as a national growth centre and to ensure balanced regional development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I am extremely disappointed that either the Minister or one of the Ministers of State could not see fit to come into the House to reply to this debate, which is a critical issue in education circles. It is critical to the good management of schools, primary and secondary. It is critical to the more than 6,000 people who will be directly affected by the actions being taken by the Minister. It appears that these people will be adversely affected.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been vocal in recent days about what has become know as the Boston or Berlin debate. It is clear that the Tánaiste is winning hands down in this debate and that it is Boston &ndash; 1, Berlin &ndash; nil. What will happen is that funding will be transferred to the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>However, not enough funding will be transferred to create a sufficient number of posts for caretakers, secretaries and classroom assistants. We can all pat ourselves on the back regarding the Celtic tiger. However, large numbers are still unable to make it on their own in the workplace and need the sheltered employment and supervision provided by community employment schemes in the areas of education, health, the environment and so on. It appears that the people concerned are to be cast aside and that Deputy Harney is winning the ideological debate regarding Boston or Berlin.</P>
      <P>I wish to read from a letter I received from a parent involved in a school board of management. It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a parent in the Bray School Project, I am writing to you in grave concern at the cutbacks <Col N="627" /> our school has suffered through serious inaction on the part of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Our problem stems from the gradual abolition of the school based FÁS Community Enterprise scheme &ndash; which now provides the school with only one classroom assistant, compared with five assistants, a secretary and a caretaker in 1999. The demise of this scheme has meant the loss of approximately £42,000 from our children's education.</P>
    <P>In a standard year, parents at the Bray School Project are faced with the task of raising 50% of the school's running costs. On top of this, we now have to find an extra £12,000 to cover the cost of the caretaker and secretary while it is impossible to even contemplate fundraising for classroom assistants.</P>
    <P>It is time money was allocated to schools and allocated in such a way as to allow every school to employ a secretary and a caretaker.</P>
    <P>I will also read from a separate letter from a school secretary. It states:</P>
    <P>I like my job as school secretary and I want to continue in this employment, but I'm sure you will agree that we, as school secretaries, deserve to be treated fairly and not discriminated against. What we really need is to be employed and paid directly by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing the most devious and underhanded transfer of arrangements between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science which directly impacts on over 6,000 people. Schools are closed and boards of management, parents and teachers are on holidays. No one is aware of the chaos to which they will return next September. No one knows the situation regarding a caretaker, secretary or classroom assistant employed on a community employment scheme. Will these people be available? This is the most devious, underhanded transfer arrangement I have witnessed and a poor reflection on the Minister for Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>We have had education on the cheap for too long. It is time schools were adequately remunerated to create full-time posts. However, in doing so we cannot turn our backs on those who gave us education on the cheap through community employment &ndash; caretakers, secretarial assistants, classroom assistants and supervisors. Just because funding will be transferred, we cannot wipe out the livelihoods of 6,000 people in education. Will those on CE schemes involving the environment or health services be next?</P>
    <P>There are still many vulnerable people. The timing of this transfer is deliberate as the Minister is aware that schools, teachers and boards of management are on holidays. I regret that the Minister for Education and Science, or one of his <Col N="628" /> Ministers of State, could not come into the House to debate this issue in an open and frank manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and apologise for the Minister, Deputy Woods, who could not be in the House. If, for genuine reasons, a Minister is not available, it is standard practice that a colleague replaces him or her. As the Deputy will acknowledge that my Department is interested in this matter, I am one of the most appropriate replacements for the Minister.</P>
      <P>l am glad to have the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position regarding this matter. As someone who has been involved in education for many years, I accept that this is an important matter. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment, officials from the Department of Education and Science are in discussions with my Department regarding this issue. These discussions are aimed at ensuring, as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of a transfer of funding from my Department to the Department of Education and Science would be to remove the anomalies regarding the provision of secretarial and caretaking services for schools. For instance, certain schools currently have the benefit of secretarial and caretaking services under CE schemes and also receive a grant for such services from the Department of Education and Science, whereas other schools are solely dependent on the grants issued by the Department of Education and Science. The purpose of the discussions taking place is to transfer full responsibility for the funding of schools for secretarial and caretaking services to the Department of Education and Science which would ensure an equitable system of funding for such services. I hope this measure will work to everyone's advantage, that this mainstreaming will lead to a better service and that those in education, particularly children, will benefit.</P>
      <P>The transfer of such moneys to the Department of Education and Science will result in significant improvements in assistance towards ancillary services for schools. The discussions are at an advanced stage and the Minister for Education and Science hopes to make a further announcement regarding this matter in the near future. While the Department of Education and Science does not operate a scheme for the provision of classroom assistants for schools generally, schools will have the flexibility to use funds for ancillary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science already has a scheme in place for providing schools with special needs assistants where schools require assistance in meeting the needs of pupils with various disabilities. Schools can apply <Col N="629" /> to the special education section of the Department where they consider they are in need of such assistance.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. I have held discussions with the Minister and he is anxious that this measure be implemented properly. He will announce further details as developments unfold.</P>

      <P>The greater Blessington area and large parts of north Wicklow have been subject to a spill-over of crime from the greater Dublin area. This particular robbery was a professional job. However, for many years I have been pressing the Minister for additional gardaí for Bray and Naas, which service west Wicklow.</P>
      <P>We have two options open to us. First, we can increase security at Russborough House and the general area. This kind of robbery is not unique to Russborough House as it could happen in the National Museum or National Library. People do not like strict security regimes as they take from the pleasure of viewing art. However, we can increase the deterrents. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Bill has reached Committee Stage and the Minister should consider introducing a section to that legislation dealing with the theft of art or artworks. If he does not introduce such an amendment, Fine Gael will do so. I hope the Minister will support that amendment. The time has now come to introduce a strong deterrent to deal with such acts. Some of the paintings from one of the previous robberies were never recovered and, although I hope we will recover both of these stolen items, it is quite possible that they will never be found.</P>
      <P>We must signal our intent in this matter, however, by creating a new section in the Larceny Bill to deal specifically with the theft of works of art and other historical artefacts. I look forward to the Minister bringing forward some innovative proposals on Committee Stage of that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> What is the current state of the investigation process? What steps is the Minister's Department taking to try to recover these paintings? </P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Timmins for raising this important matter. I am standing in for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who, unfortunately, is unable to attend the House this evening.</P>
      <P>The Minister shares the Deputy's concerns about this blatant crime, although he was glad to note that no member of the public was hurt during the incident. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that at about 12.30 p.m. yesterday, at least three men drove up the avenue of Russborough House in a Pajero jeep and a light blue Golf. The two occupants of the jeep drove up the steps of the house and rammed the front door, demolishing the bottom half. Two raiders, one of whom was armed with a pistol, then ran into the house and removed two paintings, including their frames. It is understood that one of the paintings, <i>Madame Baccelli: Dancer</i>, by Gainsborough, is valued in excess of £2 million. A third raider remained in the Golf car and all three raiders left in that vehicle.</P>
      <P>The magnetic alarms on the paintings immediately alerted gardaí in Naas. The raiders tried to set the Pajero jeep alight as they left but a Garda sergeant, who was first on the scene, succeeded in extinguishing the fire. The raiders also attempted to hijack a car driven by a local man who refused to hand over his keys. A pistol shot was fired. The gang drove on to Russelstown Park by Blessington Lake, set the Golf on fire and made their escape.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also been informed by the Garda authorities that a large Garda search operation was immediately put in place, utilising specialist Garda services as necessary. Twelve checkpoints were established and the area was searched by helicopter. The Garda dog unit, assisted by members of the Carlow/Kildare search unit, has also been carrying out searches in the area. An incident room has been established in Blessington Garda station and the Garda technical bureau is examining the scenes and vehicles.</P>
      <P>With regard to the security arrangements in place at Russburough House, I understand that it is owned and managed by the Sir Alfred Beit Foundation and that the arrangements in place are primarily a matter for it. While it would clearly not be advisable for me to go into any detail, I understand that the security at Russborough House was significantly upgraded in the wake of the 1986 robbery, and that Garda experts provided advice to the owners of the house and their security firm. The Garda Síochána are of course willing to advise and assist the foundation in any way they can to ensure the security of this part of our artistic and cultural heritage in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there has already been newspaper speculation as to the identity of the culprits <Col N="631" /> but the House will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment on this matter as the Garda investigation is still at an early stage. The House will, however, already be aware of the measures which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has put in place to tackle crime. The legislative and law enforcement measures which have been introduced in recent years have had a significant impact. Major gangs have been dismantled and a number of prominent criminals have fled this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner and the Minister are satisfied that there are adequate structures, <Col N="632" /> measures and resources in place to provide an effective response to serious crimes such as this, and they are confident that the Garda Síochána will carry out a thorough investigation into this crime.</P>
    <P>While I am not in a position to make a commitment because it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I will convey to the Minister the Deputy's views and ideas with regard to legislation covering the theft of art works.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 June 2001.</P>

      <Quest>the cost to the State of the purchase of Farmleigh House; the anticipated total cost of the refurbishment programme and the installation of security equipment; the access there will be for the public to the house and grounds when the work is completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Farmleigh property was purchased for £23 million.</P>
      <P>A contract was placed by the Commissioners of Public Works in July 2000 for major refurbishment works at Farmleigh House. The budget which also includes professional fees, statutory charges and fitting out etc. was £14.72 million. The contractor is on site and completion of the works is due by the end of June 2001. The final cost of the works will not exceed the original budget.</P>
      <P>In addition to the main refurbishment contract other works on buildings within the Farmleigh Estate, including some on the house, are being carried out on an ongoing basis. The estimate for the cost of these is £2.2 million approximately up to August 2001.</P>
      <P>The estate's utilities are also being upgraded, contracts for which were placed in February 2001. The cost of these works is approximately £1.4 million.</P>
      <P>The installation of security equipment is included in the overall cost of these aforementioned works at a cost of approximately £1 million.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to open the property for State use and to allow public access in July 2001. Facilitating public access is an important part of the overall development plan for Farmleigh. The objective is to ensure that the house and the grounds are accessible by the public to the greatest extent possible, consistent with State requirements and planning considerations.</P>
      <P>A final grant for temporary planning permission to hold events, for a period of five years, was obtained on 10 April 2001.</P>
      <P>The official opening of Farmleigh is scheduled to take place on 28 July 2001 when an open day will be held in the estate. Tickets to attend the opening will be made available to the general public. Tickets will be available on a first come, first served basis through local and national radio stations to ensure the widest possible distribution of, and access to, invitations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the weekend beginning Friday, 3 August 2001 the national concert orchestra will hold a series of three concerts on consecutive evenings. <Col N="634" /> Each event will cater for 800 attendees and tickets will, as for the open day, be distributed free of charge through national and local radio stations. It is intended that these concerts will become annual events forming the core of a wider season of public summertime events to which there will be public access.</P>
    <P>On the same weekend, guided tours of the house and gardens will be available. These will continue to be available on each Saturday and Sunday throughout the year, subject to operational and security requirements. In addition, it will be possible to book groups and school tours. These arrangements will be kept under continuous review in light of operational requirements and public demand with the intention of securing the greatest degree of public access possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high level Gender Equality Management Group, chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily, Revenue Commissioner, has produced three separate documents relating to revised policy and procedures for addressing gender equality in the Civil Service. The three documents are: A New Gender Equality Policy for the Civil Service; a guide for Departments on affirmative action entitled, Making it Happen; and an outline of mechanisms for the allocation of responsibility, accountability and monitoring in respect of gender equality.</P>
      <P>In June 2000, the Government approved the new gender equality policy in principle and directed that consultations with the staff unions on the implementation of the new policy should begin. At the same time, the Taoiseach announced that the Government had set a target of one third of posts at assistant principal level to be filled by women within five years.</P>
      <P>The policy has now been agreed with the staff unions. It was signed off at General Council on 30 May 2001. It is hoped that the new policy will be launched formally in July.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the policy, Departments have been asked to adopt increasingly specific strategic objectives and equality goals, to be published as part of each Department's strategy statement, with a view to increasing the representation of women at all grades at assistant principal level and above during the period of the statements, and to achieving the one-third target at assistant principal level over the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research on gender imbalance in the Civil Service at HEO level and above, commissioned as part of the SMI process and published in 1999, showed that women were under-represented at senior management levels in the Civil Service and <Col N="635" /> that progress towards a better balance of men and women in those grades had been minimal in the ten year period from 1987 to 1997. The report identified the under-representation of women in the assistant principal grade as a particular obstacle to the advancement of women to senior management levels within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The main research findings, together with a package of measures based on the recommendations in the report, were endorsed by the Government and were presented by the Taoiseach and myself at the launch of the current phase of the strategic management initiative for the Civil Service in July 1999. A key element of these measures was the development and adoption of a new gender equality policy.</P>

      <Quest>the total anticipated cost to the Exchequer of the changeover to the euro at the latest date for which figures are available; if it is intended to pay a subsidy to the banks in return for their not charging cash handling fees for retailers; the estimated cost of such a subsidy; if he considers that such a subsidy is justified having regard to the profits being made by the banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19035/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>From estimates supplied to my Department in respect of the Central Bank of Ireland, Departments and relevant bodies as at May 2002, the cost to the Exchequer of the changeover to the euro is estimated to be of the order of £100 million. Changeover costs are of course once-off, whereas economic and monetary union confers ongoing benefits.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, I published Ireland's Cash Changeover Plan for 2002 in April 2000. An important part of the plan is that while retailers will continue to accept Irish cash up to 9 February 2002, they will from 1 January 2002 charge in euro and give change only in euro. To do this, they will have to get euro cash from banks in advance of 1 January 2002, and will have to lodge all of the Irish cash they receive inwards during the dual circulation period.</P>
      <P>Retail representative organisations identified bank cash handling charges as a potential obstacle to retailers doing this. Retailers were concerned that they would have to pay bank cash handling charges for the euro cash that they will need to get in advance of January 2002, and cash lodgement charges on the Irish cash they will be lodging with their banks during the dual circulation period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I announced in Dáil Éireann on 8 May that, in order to facilitate the changeover process envisaged by the plan, agreement was reached with the banks by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and the Central Bank of Ireland <Col N="636" /> whereby banks will not charge cash handling charges on euro cash provided to retailers in advance of 1 January 2002; and will not charge cash lodgement charges on Irish notes and coins lodged by retailers during the dual circulation period and for a short time afterwards &ndash; that is, from 1 January 2002 until the end of the week after legal tender status is withdrawn from Irish notes and coins, that is 15 February 2002.</P>
    <P>In return for this waiver, the Central Bank will, during the dual circulation period and for a short period afterwards, provide the banks with a lodgement fee for Irish notes and coins that it receives from them. I do not consider the measure to be a subsidy to banks: rather it is a measure to meet &ndash; in part only &ndash; the income that the banks would otherwise recover from retailers in cash handling charges. The cost is estimated at between £5 million and £6 million. Banks will of course be meeting their own costs in the changeover.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The European Commission approved the new Programme for Peace and Reconciliation on 22 March 2001. A further stage in the development of the programme was completed on 15 June 2001 when the Programme Monitoring Committee agreed the Programme Complement. The Programme Complement is required under European Structural Funds regulations and sets out a range of implementation issues, including the method for the delivery of funds, detailed measure descriptions, and project selection criteria. The Programme Complement was endorsed by myself and Mr. Mark Durkan MLA, the Minister of Finance and Personnel in the Northern Ireland Executive, at a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, Special EU Programmes Sector, on 20 June 2001 and has now been submitted to the European Commission for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of related implementation issues remain to be completed by the Special EU Programmes Body, the managing authority for the programme. These should be completed over the next month or so. These include: the conclusion of contract negotiations between the Special EU Programmes Body and intermediary funding bodies which will deliver measures in the pro<Col N="637" /> gramme; the establishment of financial control procedures; and general operational and management arrangements necessary for the implementation of the programme. I am hopeful that the timetable for the delivery of funding that I outlined to the Dáil earlier this year will be met. This should see funds flowing to projects by autumn time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG IIIA Community Initiative Programme, I would like to inform the Deputy that good progress is being made. Proposals for this programme were lodged with the European Commission last November following approval by the North-South Ministerial Council. Authorities North and South received the formal response of the Commission to these proposals in mid-May and negotiations with the Commission opened on 1 June 2001. A revised draft of the proposals is to be lodged with the Commission in July. I am anxious that these negotiations be completed quickly, and my counterpart in the North South Ministerial Council, Mr. Mark Durkan MLA, shares this view. This matter was addressed at our meeting in Dublin on 20 June 2001. Detailed implementation procedures will be contained in a Programme Complement to be completed following agreement on the programme with the Commission. I am hopeful that funding under this key North-South programme will be available later this year.</P>
    <P>Including matching national funds, 141.3 million has been allocated to the Border region under the Peace and Reconciliation Programme 2000-2004. The South's contribution to the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG IIIA Programme 2000-2006 is 71.5 million, including matching national funds. The EU contribution to the programmes is 106 million and 53.6 million respectively. Both programmes are being managed by the Special EU Programmes Body and will be implemented by a range of departments, intermediary funding bodies and locally based agencies.</P>

      <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established on 19 July 2000 following discussions between public service employers and unions as provided for under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It has been asked to report by end-June 2002. The body has met the unions and employers and has received submissions from the two sides on both general matters and in relation to specific groups who are being reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> The body is undertaking its own research at present. This involves consultants and the body's own secretariat evaluating jobs in the public service. This process has been arranged with the co-operation of both the unions and employers. Following a tendering process and interviews with interested firms, contracts were awarded recently to six firms &ndash; Hay, Mercer, Inbucon UK, Watson-Wyatt, Alpha and Fitzpatrick Associates. These companies will be researching pay determination practice across the economy and evaluating the work, pay and conditions of employees using a common job evaluation scheme which has been specifically devised for this purpose by the benchmarking body. The body also has the assistance of an internal expert consultancy, MCG Consulting, to advise on and continuously audit its processes, the research and ensure best practice.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that oral hearings will take place with the employers and unions in the autumn to winter after this research is completed. The arrangements for these oral hearings are under discussion at present with the unions and employers. After these hearings the body will begin drafting its report with a view to finalising it by the target date of end-June 2002. I have been assured by the body that it will meet this deadline.</P>
    <P>It was agreed under the PPF that a quarter of any increase recommended for any group would be paid with effect from 1 December 2001 with the balance to be paid in accordance with arrangements to be negotiated between the unions and employers after the report is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Government's policy on the provision of child care, I announced in my budget speech in December 2000 the allocation of £10 million capital over two years for the provision of 15 crèches for civil servants throughout the country. In response to this announcement, my Department entered into negotiations with the Civil Service unions on the structures necessary to oversee such a major expansion of child care facilities.</P>
      <P>It was agreed with the staff side that a new Civil Service child care agency would be established. Management of the existing Mount Street crèche and the Marlborough Street crèche, which will be operational by autumn 2001, will be the responsibility of the agency once established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the agency will be to: promote the provision of crèches in the Civil Service in accord<Col N="639" /> ance with Government policy; advise Departments generally on that provision; and contract with suitable individuals or companies to run Civil Service crèches, on foot of tenders considered and decided by the board in accordance with normal public accounting procedures.</P>
    <P>In early May a circular issued to all Departments outlining procedures for drawing down funds for the provision of Civil Service crèches. Departments were requested to survey the child care needs of their staff, and, where there was sufficient demand, to submit outline proposals for the establishment of crèches to my Department by 15 June.</P>
    <P>There has been a satisfactory response rate to date and a number of proposals are under active consideration. The more promising proposals will be developed in co-operation with the Office of Public Works and the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe this initiative will lead to a substantial increase in the number of crèche places available to children of civil servants.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the electoral Acts place a number of reporting obligations on members of the Houses in relation to, for example, making annual statements of interests and political donations and <i>ad hoc</i> disclosures of interests where a proximate conflict of interest arises. The Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, the Report Stage of which will be discussed tomorrow, contains provisions which will ensure greater convenience to Members in complying with the requirements of these pieces of legislation. The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, provides for a revised donation regime which will involve additional administration for Members of the Houses. The Deputy should know that a number of the obligations arising from the ethics and electoral Acts fall not just on Members of the Houses, but also on others &ndash; for example, unsuccessful candidates in respect of donation statements under the electoral Acts and public servants and directors of state bodies in respect of statements of interests under the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas are at present finalising arrangements to have carried out by consultants a comprehensive analysis of the staff resources required to service both Houses and <Col N="640" /> the committees, including a review of the levels of non-Civil Service staff resources which are made available to assist Deputies and Senators in connection with their parliamentary duties. It is anticipated that this will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This analysis follows on from a 1999 Institute of Public Administration organisational review of the senior management structures of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. A key recommendation of the IPA report was that the staff resources and grading system of the Office should be analysed and that skills and competency requirements of the Office should be clearly defined. The analysis by consultants will take account of the IPA review and will be carried out in the context of the ongoing process of reform in the public service and the specific initiatives taking place within the Houses of the Oireachtas arising from its review of its senior management structures by the IPA and the proposal to establish an Oireachtas Commission.</P>
    <P>Until such time as the consultancy review I have mentioned has been completed, I would not be disposed to make provision for an increase in the staffing levels of the Houses.</P>

      <P>I have no statutory function in regard to decisions relating to the location or size of bank branch networks. Such matters are the prerogative of credit institutions themselves, who must be free to make decisions on the maintenance, closure or opening of branches on the basis of their own commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding, I appreciate the concerns that arise at local level when branch closures are proposed. Any restructuring of branch networks should be done in a sensible and intelligent manner and should be done in partnership with customers.</P>
      <P>I signalled my concerns regarding branch closures to the IBF at a meeting I had with the federation last November. Officials of my Department raised the matter subsequently with the IBF at a meeting on 21 February. Since then the IBF wrote to me to say that it is looking into the issue of developing a code of practice to cover bank and customer communication around the issue of branch restructuring. I welcome the intention of the IBF to develop a code of practice on this important subject and my officials remain at the disposal of the IBF in this regard, if required.</P>
      <P>I am scheduled to meet with the IBF on 5 July next. I will take that opportunity to raise once again my concerns on the closure of bank branches and to impress upon the federation the importance of early agreement of a code of conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will have a strong focus on consumer issues and, in that context, I believe it would be appropriate for the new authority to monitor and report on access to banking services. In that way, the public generally and the Members of this House could have an authoritative source of information on the issues arising from the changes currently under way in the man<Col N="642" /> ner in which banks provide people with access to their services.</P>

The establishment of the rural development co-ordinating committee was, in fact, provided for in the plan as part of the rural proofing of implementation of the plan. The White Paper on Rural Development provided the basis for such proofing. Chapter 11 of the plan sets out the manner in which the overall strategy provided for in the White Paper is addressed and, as indicated therein, overall NDP investment impacting directly on rural development will be of the order of 8.5 billion.</P>
      <P>The chair and secretariat for the rural development co-ordinating committee will be provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The terms of reference of the committee are to: review the rural development related policies underpinning non co-financed and Structural Funds co-financed investment under the NDP-CSF and the impact of that investment on rural areas and rural communities within the overall perspective of the White Paper on Rural Development; assess and report on the degree of rural development integration achieved in the implementation of operational programmes and initiatives; act as a forum for the promotion of rural development policies and practices among Departments, implementing agencies, social partners and others involved in the NDP-CSF, with particular emphasis on the development of monitoring methodologies and mechanisms to facilitate the Government's rural development objectives; report to, and make recommendations to, the NDP-CSF monitoring committee on the performance and impact of the operational programmes on rural areas and rural communities; and contribute to the mid-term review of the NDP-CSF, consistent with the arrangements set out in the CSF for the mid-term review, by providing advice in relation to rural development related issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any incentive, whether tax or grant, is available only if one carries out the action necessary to obtain it. I have done my best over the past number of years to put as many people as possible in a situation where they can now save, through general improvement in the economy and consequent rise in living standards. The scheme is a general one and seeks to encompass everyone over 18 in the State; while not everyone will in fact participate, for various reasons, this does not negate the scheme itself. As far as is practicable, I have done my best to make the scheme accessible by requiring that as little as the equivalent of about £2.50 per week only needs to be saved by an individual to qualify for participation in a special savings incentive account. A number of deposit-taking institutions are offering products which facilitate the small saver in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, I should point out that providing a standard rate of tax credit available to everyone <Col N="646" /> irrespective of their tax position means that every saver who saves the same amount will get the same benefit. The amount per month saved that can benefit is also limited. Other proposals put to me before the introduction of the scheme would have featured marginal rate relief or limits on type of investments, features likely to be of more benefit to the better off. In arranging the scheme, features have been built in to try to ensure that it has broad appeal and benefit.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to introduce any further saving scheme nor have I received advice from the money advice and budgeting service unit of the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 49, 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The latest harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, inflation rates in the EU member states for May are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>The highest annual rates of inflation as measured by the EU's harmonised index of consumer prices were in the Netherlands, 5.4%, Portugal, 4.9%, and Spain, 4.2%.</P>
      <P>The lowest annual rates of inflation were in the UK, 1.7%, France, 2.5% and Denmark, 2.8%.</P>
      <P>Annual inflation in Ireland in May 2001 as measured by the consumer price index was 5.4%, while the HICP figure was 4.1%. Increases in food &ndash; in part due to foot and mouth disease &ndash; and in housing contributed 3.2% to the 5.4% consumer price index annual increase.</P>
      <P>The Government is continuing to closely monitor inflation. Budget measures such as the cut in value added tax and excise duties are expected to have reduced the headline rate of inflation by an estimated 0.5% this year.</P>
      <P>Inflation is still expected to decline over the second half of this year. At budget time my Department forecast an average CPI increase this year of 4.5%. A revised inflation forecast will be released in my Department's, Economic Review and Outlook, which will be published later this summer.</P>
      <P>We must all be vigilant in relation to the upward pressure on inflation from unfavourable wage trends. In my view strict adherence to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is the best way to ensure that wage developments do not discourage direct investment and endanger our competitiveness.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons who have contacted the Revenue Commissioners wishing to take advantage of the arrangements announced by the Revenue Commissioners on 2 May 2001 for payment of back taxes by bogus non-resident account holders; if settlements have been agreed by the Revenue Commissioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, at this initial phase, their primary emphasis is on ensuring that the relevant arrangements are brought to the attention of tax practitioners and taxpayers affected.</P>
      <P>I am advised by Revenue that the dedicated helpline, which was specially set up to answer queries in relation to the statement of practice issued on 2 May 2001, has to date received more than 600 general inquiries, many of which were from tax practitioners. In addition, Revenue has also conducted nationwide seminars on the statement of practice in the course of which tax advisers have had the opportunity to discuss and clarify issues in relation to the operation of the arrangements. National and local advertising is being undertaken. Many account holders may have to gather information to make a full disclosure.</P>
      <P>As at 22 June 2001 three account holders with liabilities had already made disclosures on forms BNR1, the required form of disclosure. The total amount paid by the three account holders was £396,044. This total amount was made up of £198,075 tax and £197,969 interest and penalties. The disclosures which have already been made are being acknowledged and, subject to any examination of these disclosures after 15 November when all forms BNR1 have been received, they will be treated as discharging the previously undisclosed liabilities of the account holders concerned.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a representative selection of the forms BNR1 will be examined. This selection will not be made until all the forms have been received, that is, until after 15 November, so as to ensure that the selection is representative of all disclosures, whether made early or at the last minute. I am further advised that the intention of this examination is to deter and detect any abuse rather than to find fault with best estimates made on a reasonable basis where information is now incomplete.</P>
      <P>Revenue has emphasised that the work of auditors and investigators who will be addressing bogus non-resident accounts after 15 November will be primarily focused on those account holders who have not disclosed and paid by that deadline. A much more severe regime will apply in these cases in comparison with voluntary disclosures. Revenue recommends early action in this matter by account holders and their advisers in order to lessen the pressures which would be experienced in the event of a last minute rush before the 15 November deadline.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as part of their major review of internal structures, they examined the existing arrangements for the investigation by Revenue officers of serious tax evasion, with a view to prosecution, which were put in place in late 1996. These arrangements have facilitated a more active prosecution policy with an increasing number of cases being referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and subsequently reaching the courts. Since 1996, a total of 13 convictions have been handed down by the courts in tax evasion cases. In the past year, two of those convicted received jail sentences. There are currently three cases before the courts and summonses are about to be issued in three others.</P>
      <P>Last year, as a result of the internal review, it was decided that further progress could best be achieved by the establishment of a new Revenue prosecution division. This was endorsed in the report of the steering group established by me as a result of a recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts in its first report on the DIRT inquiry. A project team to design the new division was recently established and is now working on it. I understand that their work will be completed over the next few months and that it is intended to have the division in operation before the end of this year. The new division will co-ordinate all prosecution activity undertaken by Revenue and will be responsible for further developing the approach to prosecution of cases of serious evasion of taxes and duties. This will allow the expertise and experience in Revenue to be harnessed to greatest effect in progressing the aim of bringing more cases before the courts. I am informed that it is too early to indicate the numbers of staff which will be allocated to the division but the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that it will be adequately resourced with staff with appropriate skills and experience and will have ongoing legal expertise available to it.</P>

      <P>In April 2000 the Government approved the development of a digital media village in association with the MediaLab Europe project. The estimates for 2000 included a capital provision of £29 million, of which £14 million was to meet commitments in relation to MediaLab Europe with the balance of £15 million being available for other costs involved.</P>
      <P>I understand that during 2000, the Office of Public Works, at the request of Digital Media Development Limited, identified a number of properties in the Liberties and Thomas Street areas which were considered suitable for purchase towards the development of the digital hub. In December 2000, £15 million was transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach into an escrow account at the request of the Office of Public Works to enable it arrange for deposits to be placed to secure properties.</P>
      <P>Following consultations in the matter, it was considered that the most appropriate manner to deal with the acquisitions was to make financial provision in the current year. The relevant funds were included in a Revised Estimate for 2001 for the Department of Public Enterprise which has responsibility for the project. The funds in the Escrow account were returned to the Exchequer.</P>

At that time economic growth was forecast to increase by 8.8% in GDP terms and by 7.4% in GNP terms. Since the last budget there have been developments which are likely to negatively impact on the growth rate in 2001. The slowdown in the US economy and its repercussions for other world markets can be expected to have some effect on Irish exports and investment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy of the OECD Economic Outlook No. 69 which gives the OECD's view of all the member countries. The outlook points out that growth in the OECD area is expected to be 2% this year, half the rate achieved last year although this is expected to recover somewhat to between 2.5% and 3% next year. Slower growth across the OECD area, combined with an expected fall in the price of oil, should help keep inflation low. The recovery in growth which is projected for next year is based on factors such as the interest rate reductions which have already taken place and lower oil prices. The main risk to this outlook which the OECD identifies is a further substantial decline in the value of technology stocks which would adversely affect aggregate demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section on the Irish economy included in the outlook notes that real GDP grew by almost 11% last year. Despite slower export growth due <Col N="653" /> to a fall in demand for high technology products, GDP is projected to grow by 7.75% this year and next. Inflation is projected to ease this year. However, the OECD expects that consumer prices will remain above the euro area average due to services prices growing rapidly in line with rising wages in a tight labour market.</P>
    <P>The OECD notes that the last budget gave priority to preserving social partnership but goes on to suggest that partnership needs to evolve towards setting general principles guiding pay determination rather than pre-committing fiscal policy. The report notes the Government's efforts to address strains in infrastructure by means of the national development plan. In addition, it notes that a number of steps have been taken to improve the flexibility of training and human capital formation in order to attract and maintain foreign direct investment which can support higher wages than in the past. At the same time, it notes that regulatory reform is being strengthened and competition fostered.</P>
    <P>The OECD considers that the risks are more balanced than in the past. Private sector balance sheets appear to be sound but if a marked correction in house prices were to occur, that could lead to weaker consumption and a more cautious lending attitude. A more general risk is that the economy will not slow to around potential, leading to a surge in wage demands and a greater likelihood of a sharper, more disruptive correction at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>Overall, the OECD's comments on the Irish economy are positive. Although some risks remain, they expect strong growth to continue. To ensure sustainable growth they advise, and I agree, that policy needs to continue to focus on improving both human capital and the provision of infrastructure.</P>

They restated their intention to intensify communication campaigns in the second half of the year to help ensure a successful cash changeover.</P>
    <P>In this context, Ministers re-iterated their policy that, overall, conversion into euro of all prices, charges and fees administered by their Governments will be price neutral or smoothed in favour of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Ministers urged retailers to follow-up to their commitment in the agreement of good practices between European consumers and retailers of 2 April 2001 and to do their utmost to ensure the overall stability of their prices when converting them into euro and to communicate this commitment clearly to their customers. Ministers also noted that many Member States had intensified the monitoring of prices, and that the competent bodies were alert to developments regarding price conversion.</P>
    <P>Ministers considered that dual display of prices throughout the changeover period is of utmost importance to allow consumers to check prices both in euro and in the national currency unit. In this respect, they encouraged consumers to increase their familiarity with euro-denominated prices, and to continue to compare carefully prices between competing retailers, particularly during the rest of this year and throughout the period of the cash changeover.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, EU Ministers have not recently had discussions with a view to preparing for, or encouraging, those EU member states currently outside the euro area to join the single currency. Participation in the euro is a matter for the member states concerned. Ireland would look favourably on an application by any of these to join the euro. However, no such application has been made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 2000, included provisions, subject to a commencement order, for the introduction of a special scheme of targeted relief in respect of the purchase of milk quotas under guidelines to be issued by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for the introduction of the milk quota restructuring scheme. It was subsequently considered that the commencement order should be delayed pending the result of a High Court challenge to the scheme. The judgment of the High Court was appealed to the Supreme Court with the decision of the High Court in favour of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development being upheld by the Supreme Court in a ruling on 30 March last.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of any new scheme of this nature, European Commission rules on State aids must be respected. It has emerged only recently that the Commission has decided to open proceedings under Article 88 (2) of the EC Treaty against the Spanish authorities in respect of the operation of an interest rebate scheme for the purchase of milk quotas. In the circumstances, it is considered that the commencement order should not be signed until clarification on the matter has been received from the Commission. Officials from my Department, working jointly with officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, have submitted papers on the scheme planned for implementation in Ireland to the Commission. A meeting is taking place today in Brussels between Irish and Commission officials to discuss the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary thrust of Enterprise Ireland's regional strategy is on creating and sustaining economic activity throughout the country. The strategy is based on four distinct pillars, two of which deal with the enhancement of the <Col N="656" /> operating environment for companies and with encouraging investments by expansion-minded Dublin-based companies in regional locations. The strategy recognises that the road, rail and telecommunications infrastructure requires significant investment in certain regions. These are being addressed in the context of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Government's policy of regional dispersal of economic activity is being actively pursued and it is intended to maximise the potential that currently exists for such development in parallel with the infrastructure programme set out in the national development plan.

      <P>The Tánaiste and I have been following closely developments in relation to Independent Insurance Company Limited (IICL), a UK insurer which went into voluntary liquidation on 18 June, with particular focus on the immediate implications for Irish policyholders and claimants. We are also concerned at the broader implications for the effective operation of the European Single Market in insurance. Contact is being maintained with the UK authorities and with the EU Commission, as well as with the provisional liquidators, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Irish Brokers Association.</P>
      <P>Under the rules of the European Single Market, responsibility for financial supervision of the company's operations throughout the European Economic Area (EEA) lies with the UK authorities. The main objective of the EU system of financial supervision of insurance companies is to protect policyholders while giving them access to insurance cover from supervised companies in all EEA member states. The treatment of policyholders as creditors of a failed insurer is determined by the laws of the home member state, in this case the United Kingdom. UK insolvency law treats all policyholders as unsecured creditors. It will not be clear for some time the extent to which the liquidators of IICL will be able to meet claims from the creditors of IICL, including policyholders. It appears likely that claims will not be met in full.</P>
      <P>The UK policyholder protection Act provides, subject to certain limitations, that compensation be paid to individual policyholders in the event of a company failure. Corporate policyholders are compensated only in respect of compulsory insurance. Our officials are seeking to clarify whether any policies issued to Irish policyholders will meet the qualifying criteria for protection. I met with the Irish Insurance Federation and representatives of the policyholders on this issue last week. We are awaiting the submission of further information to us on this matter.</P>

      <P>At present, the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-1991, provide a higher rate for employees with long service in that the over 41 age group is allowed a week's pay at the gross rate of pay for every year of service as opposed to a half week's pay for those under the age of 41 years.

      <P>I am advised that questioning of existing or prospective employees by employers, along the lines set out by the Deputy, has no legal basis and cannot be carried out without a person's consent. Under our Constitution, it may be an infringement of human rights in relation to privacy and bodily integrity to do so. Even if it were a condition of a contract of employment that employees or potential employees were required to undergo some form of health screening, the prior consent of the employee would be required.</P>
      <P>The retention of records by employers or disclosure of information to other potential employers would be in contravention of the Data Protection Act, 1988, which requires that all information held by employers should be relevant to the position held or being applied for, by the employee. In addition, there would also be breaches of the Freedom of Information Act, 1998, in relation to public servants if records relating to them were transferred to another employer.</P>
      <P>Requiring some employees and not others to undergo health screening would also be discriminatory under the Equality Act, 1998. Finally, because of the complexity of the issue, I have no proposals to introduce legislation to regulate health screening of employees. Breaches of the legislation referred to may be pursued in accordance with the arrangements set out in the respective Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the relative high costs of insurance in this country remains an issue of concern for our Department. I appreciate the situation is particularly difficult for young drivers seeking motor insurance. In 1996, Deloitte and Touche were commissioned to report on insurance costs in this country. Their report found that the main contributory factors to rising premium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements; the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards relative to special damages in smaller claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> Although this report remains a valuable source of information about insurance costs in Ireland, in 1998 I re-established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board (MIAB) to provide me with more up to date information on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers especially is being examined by the board. The MIAB's final report is expected at the end of this year and in the light of the report's recommendations, I will take whatever further action is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Following a Government decision earlier this year, an interdepartmental implementation group has been established to progress the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board (PIAB). I am confident that the setting up of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation for work related injures in its initial term of operation and later in motor injury cases. While the Government does not wish to rule out any particular course of action, EU law prevents us from requiring the prior approval of scales of premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Good Friday Agreement contained extensive provisions in the areas of equality and human rights. The British Government undertook to create a statutory duty on public authorities in Northern Ireland to carry out all their functions with due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity in relation to religion and political opinion, gender, race, disability, age, marital status, dependants and sexual orientation. This duty was created under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act, 1998, requiring public authorities to produce and review equality schemes, conduct equality impact assessments and include consultation as an integral part of the policy-making process. Equality schemes must include, in particular, a statement of the authority's arrangements for the assessment of the likely impact of policies on the promotion of equality of opportunity, the monitoring of any adverse impact of policies, the publishing of results of such assessments and measures for training staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government also undertook, subject to the outcome of consultation, to establish a statutory equality commission to replace the Fair Employment Commission, the Equality Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Disability Council. Legislative provision was made for the commission in the Northern Ireland Act, 1998, and it was established on 1 October 1999. Strengthened fair employment legislation was enacted through the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern <Col N="662" /> Ireland) Order, 1998, which, for the first time, makes it unlawful to discriminate on religious grounds in the provision of goods, facilities and services.</P>
    <P>In the agreement, the British Government undertook to make progress with measures to combat unemployment and to eliminate the differential in unemployment rates between the two communities. Labour force statistics continue to show a level of unemployment among Catholics significantly higher than among Protestants, and Catholics remain under-represented in the workplace. However, under the 1998 order it is not unlawful for employers to deliberately seek recruits who are unemployed or to provide religion specific training.</P>
    <P>In the area of Human Rights, the British Government undertook to complete incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights. This was achieved through the Human Rights Act, 1998, which entered into force on 2 October 2000. It also undertook to establish a human rights commission. Legislative provision was made in the Northern Ireland Act, 1998, and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was established on 1 March 1999.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the agreement, the commission is preparing advice for the British Government on the scope for defining in Westminster legislation, rights supplementary to those in the European Convention on Human Rights, to reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. These additional rights are to intended to reflect the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem and, taken together with the ECHR, to constitute a bill of rights for Northern Ireland. The Commission has engaged in an extensive process of consultation with the public and will, it is expected, provide its draft advice to the Secretary of State in the near future.</P>
    <P>The European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, currently before the Oireachtas, will place the Human Rights Commission in the South on a full statutory footing. It has, of course, been working in an interim capacity for some months. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has lead responsibility for this legislation, has said that he hopes that this will be achieved as soon as possible and definitely before the end of the present parliamentary session. The commission will then be able to participate fully in the joint committee, including representatives of both commissions on the island, provided for in the agreement, which will act as a forum for consideration of human rights issues in the island of Ireland and will also consider, among other issues, the possibility of establishing a charter, open to signature by all democratic political parties, reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of the fundamental rights of everyone living on the island of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in the Middle East is cause for great concern. The risk of escalation of the conflict exists. However, I do not believe that it is at present sliding towards war and the countries directly concerned are well aware that they must avert this risk. Similarly, the international community is conscious that it should do all it can to assist the countries of the region to ensure that peace rests on a solid foundation. A number of steps have been taken toward the resumption of peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following declaration of ceasefires by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the sides reached agreement on 13 June on a package of measures to renew security co-operation brokered by the Director of the CIA, George Tenet. While there are major difficulties, the Tenet <Col N="664" /> agreement offers some hope of moving out of what had become an increasingly intractable and unsustainable situation. The agreement concentrates on security matters and does not seek to resolve the broader political issues, which cannot be kept separate from security concerns for long. The sides now need to move beyond the cease-fire to begin implementing the entire package of political measures as outlined in the Mitchell report. The cease-fire may not hold unless there is rapid movement on easing closures of Palestinian towns and withdrawal of forces as well as a freeze on all settlement activity. Similarly the Palestinian Authority must do all in its power to combat terrorism and end incitement.</P>
    <P>The EU and the UN have a vital part to play in supporting the peace process. High Representative Javier Solana presented a report on the role of the EU in the implementation of the Mitchell plan at the European Council in Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June. The European Council welcomed the report and shared Solana's views that rebuilding confidence needs urgent improvement of the situation on the ground, rebuilding faith in peace needs our support for the restoration of co-operation between civil societies and aid to the Palestinian institutions and economy remains a European commitment that should be maintained as part of an international effort.</P>
    <P>High Representative Solana met with President Arafat and Prime Minister Sharon on 22 June to discuss how the EU might contribute to the resumption of peace negotiations. UN Secretary General Annan also travelled to the Middle East on 12 to 18 June on a visit aimed at pressing the Palestinians and Israelis to implement the Mitchell recommendations. The Security Council will consider what useful contribution it can make in the light of developments on the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the United States of America participated in the diplomatic conference of plenipotentiaries in Rome in 1998, at which the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court, ICC, was adopted. However, it initially declined to sign the statute on the grounds that it feared that US troops operating overseas could be exposed to the jurisdiction of the court, and that a future definition of the crime of aggression might render senior officials and even the President criminally liable for taking action to preserve national security. When the US signed the statute immediately prior to the 31 December <Col N="665" /> 2000 deadline, President Clinton stated that he did not recommend that his successor submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until the fundamental concerns of the US were satisfied.</P>
      <P>Since then, a number of politicians within the US have moved to oppose the ICC. Last month, the American Servicemembers' Protection Bill, which would prohibit the US from co-operating with the ICC on certain matters, and bar US participation in UN peacekeeping operations unless the Security Council declares UN personnel immune from the jurisdiction of the ICC, was passed by the House of Representatives. The Bill is being considered by the Senate foreign relations committee. Meanwhile the new US Administration is conducting a policy review of the ICC which will be finalised shortly.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its EU partners have co-ordinated their reaction to these developments. A common position, affirming the commitment of the EU to the Rome statute, calling for the widest possible ratification of the statute and pledging support for its early entry into force, was approved by the General Affairs Council on 11 June. In line with the common position, the EU has made representations to Washington emphasising its support for the Rome statute and urging the US to take its place as a partner in the ICC. These representations have also stressed that the ICC will contribute to the safety of men and women engaged in peace support missions, as it will deter crime.</P>
      <P>While the participation of the US in the ICC is not essential for its establishment, it is desirable for the statute to have the widest possible application and for the court to enjoy maximum co-operation from the international community. The result of the recent referendum on the ICC, referred to in the Deputy's question, is a significant step towards the State's ratification of the Rome statute. Ratification of the Rome statute will take place once the necessary implementing legislation is prepared by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and passed by the Oireachtas. Early ratification of the statute remains a priority for my Department.</P>

In such cases An Post advertises the post at least twice and actively canvasses for suitable persons to fill the vacant positions. It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found that a post office is closed on a temporary basis pending an application from such a person. A total of 98 post offices have closed temporarily since 1997 and the dates of closure and locations, as provided to me by the company, are as follows:</P>

      <P>My Department is for the administration of the Road Transport Act, 1932, which provides the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus and coach passenger services here. CIÉ and its subsidiary companies, for example, Bus Éireann, are exempt from the requirement to hold a licence for passenger services. It is open to private bus operators to apply to my Department for a licence to operate scheduled road passenger services in any part of the country. Such applications are considered in accordance with the legislative requirements and the policy guidelines adopted by my Department. Successful applicants will be granted an annual licence for continuous passenger road services or an occasional licence for services that are of a seasonal nature. </P>
      <P>In addition, my Department has been developing a rural transport initiative, RTI, which aims to promote and support the development of innovative, community-based public transport projects in rural areas. A sum of £3.5 million has been earmarked for this purpose in the national development plan. My Department carried out a public consultation on the initiative earlier this year and I plan to launch the initiative in Athlone on 2 July. It will be open to applicants from all rural parts of the country and all proposals will be assessed in line with the eligibility and other criteria.</P>

      <P>The quadrupling of the rail track, including upgrading of signalling between Hazelhatch and Sallins, is a key project identified under the national development plan. Completion of the project will enable the separation of long distance and suburban trains on the Kildare line into Dublin. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that consultants have been commissioned by them to advance the design work. The planned upgrade of the Kildare to Heuston rail corridor will, on completion, provide up to six express and six suburban train &lsquo;paths' per hour. This will significantly upgrade the level of service provided to commuters in the south Kildare and Carlow areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 60 new diesel rail cars have been ordered for delivery in 2002-03 to provide for enhanced suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area generally. A further 20 diesel rail cars have been ordered for delivery in 2003, <Col N="670" /> bringing the total on order to 80. The delivery of new diesel rail cars and planned track development will enhance commuter rail services on the Kildare line. Plans are also well in hand to reopen Monasterevin station.</P>

      <P>The demand for services has increased year-on-year on all routes operated by Iarnród Éireann and the Waterford to Dublin line is no exception. The National Development Plan 2000-2006, launched in November 1999, provides £500 million for the mainline rail renewal and an upgrading programme.</P>
      <P>I understand from Iarnród Éireann that the mainline renewal work is progressing satisfactorily on all lines including the Waterford to Dublin line. Additional rolling stock is on order for delivery in 2002-03. These vehicles will be used to reduce the age profile of the fleet generally and to provide enhanced services.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the Waterford to Dublin line benefited substantially from investment of £10.7 million under the EU Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99. In 2000 £2 million was spent on the enhancement of the line and a further £5 million will be spent during 2001.</P>
      <P>The work to date has involved the replacement of life expired jointed tracks on timber sleepers with continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann expects the work to be completed by end 2003 and passengers will see a reduction of up to ten minutes on the journey time from Dublin to Waterford.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the national sheep identification system it is now illegal for slaughter plants to accept sheep which are not properly identified and tagged. By law the information on the tag must appear on a label attached to the finished carcase. Sheep imported from another EU member state, including from the North, going directly to slaughter must retain the tags inserted in their ears in the member state from which they have been imported.</P>
      <P>Imported sheep going on to a holding must be tagged with red import tags bearing the appropriate flock number and an individual number, in addition to retaining any existing tags. The individual tag numbers are issued centrally by my Department and tags are supplied by commercial operators. In addition, there are strict provisions in place governing the records which must be kept by all flock owners. These records must show the details of all movements of sheep.</P>
      <P>Failure to comply with the various requirements of this system will attract penalties provided for in the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 to 2001.</P>

      <P>The agenda for the meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, which I attended on 5 June 2001 in Luxembourg consisted of a number of issues.</P>
      <P>Under the heading of Preparation for the Gothenburg European Council, three issues were discussed. These were the 2001 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, BEPGs, sustainable development and taxation issues.</P>
      <P>In regard to the BEPGs, the Council agreed on the text to be sent to the Gothenburg European Council for political endorsement by the Heads of State and Government. The BEPGs would then be formally adopted by a special session of ECOFIN in Gothenburg.</P>
      <P>The annual BEPGs are intended to define the main objectives and policy orientations for European economic policy in general and for individual member states over a 12 month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section of the 2001 guidelines which applies to all member states identifies three main challenges for the future: in the short term &ndash; to preserve the expansion in growth and jobs; in medium term &ndash; to improve the basis for future <Col N="677" /> growth and employment and in the longer term &ndash; to prepare for the impact of the ageing population.</P>
    <P>The section of the guidelines on Ireland notes that economic growth is slowing due to the slowdown in the US and the effects of the foot and mouth disease, and that inflation is set to moderate. The guidelines recommend that budgetary policy be used to ease demand in the economy and public expenditure control be strengthened. The guidelines acknowledge our strong employment growth, that we are well exposed to international competition and the ongoing structural change in our capital markets.</P>
    <P>Ireland, like most other member states, had before Gothenburg sought a number of amendments to the draft guidelines, some of which have been reflected in the final text.</P>
    <P>We set out our position in a minute statement &ndash; which draws attention to the views we expressed at the time the recommendation to Ireland in respect of the 2000 BEPGs was being considered at the ECOFIN of 12 February 2001, and to the uncertainties which are inherent in macroeconomic forecasts on which the guidelines are necessarily based &ndash; which was included in the minutes of the ECOFIN meeting of 5 June.</P>
    <P>Returning to the other items discussed at ECOFIN, the Council had an exchange of views on the Commission's communication on sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The Council took note of a number of reports relating to the tax package, the taxation of savings and the code of conduct and approved conclusions with regard to the taxation of savings and the code of conduct and with regard to the future work on all aspects of the tax package. Under the heading of indirect taxation, Ministers examined the issue of VAT on e-commerce and energy taxation. The Council agreed that discussions on these issues would continue.</P>
    <P>Ministers took note of the Commission's progress report on the implementation of the financial services action plan and welcomed the adoption of the key directives on the reorganisation and winding-up of credit institutions and insurance undertakings. Ministers also agreed in principle on macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and agreed conclusions relating to the financial regulation applicable to the EU budget and to the fight against fraud.</P>
    <P>The lunchtime discussion included progress on the Lamfalussy report on the regulation of the European securities market, economic dialogue with Russia, and the usual Presidency debriefing on the Eurogroup meeting which was held the previous evening.</P>

      <P>It is my assessment that the rejection of the Nice treaty in the recent referendum should not have any material impact on Ireland's economic growth, at least in the short-term. Failure to follow through on EU enlargement could adversely affect growth prospects in the long term.</P>
      <P>The rejection of the treaty does not affect the amount of Structural Funds and CAP funding for Ireland for the period 2000-06. The amounts for Ireland were agreed at the Berlin European Council in 1999 and remain unaltered.</P>

Being part of this major economic bloc has given us access to huge markets and this, in turn, has been a driving force behind business investment and employment growth. These influences will continue to provide a basis for future progress. More directly, funding received under the Common Agricultural Policy has improved the living standards of the farming community while EU Structural and Cohesion Funds have underpinned a substantial improvement in Ireland's infrastructure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>Balance of payments statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office show that direct investment inflows into Ireland amounted to £17,714 million last year. Inward investment into IFSC enterprises accounted for about 60% of this. Data for this year is not available.</P>
      <P>Ireland remains an attractive location for mobile foreign direct investment. By improving the incentive to take up employment the income taxation packages of recent years will have the effect of boosting labour supply. This additional labour supply should help to reduce some of the constraints currently being experienced in the labour market which is of particular importance for foreign owned multinationals locating in Ireland. Additional labour supply should also help to reduce wage demands which will enhance the competitiveness of the economy. In addition, recent budgets have helped to maintain the partnership process which is an important consideration for the competitiveness of the economy.</P>
      <P>Improving the infrastructure of the State through the implementation of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will also have positive implications for the competitiveness of the economy.</P>
      <P>Other factors encouraging continued inward investment include a favourable corporation taxation regime; a favourable grant structure; a young, flexible, skilled and well educated workforce; a pro-business environment; participation in EMU; and access to the EU market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 97 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An advertisement for interested developers to tender for the construction and fitting out of a headquarters office for the European Union Food and Veterinary Office was published in the <Col N="680" /> Official Journal of the European Communities on 7 August 1997, reference S152 volume 40.</P>
    <P>Advertisements were also published in the national press and local press in County Meath at the same time. Eight developers were short-listed from 23 applicants and these were invited to tender on 16 March 1998. Michael McNamara and Company was the successful tenderer and a contract was subsequently placed with it. All sub-contracts were placed directly by the company with the contractors concerned.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works was not informed of any site investigation feasibility study at Derrypatrick, Grange, County Meath, carried out by the European Commission. On selection of the site for the new headquarters for the EU Food and Veterinary Office the Office of Public Works carried out a full site appraisal in the normal way for such construction projects. This revealed the need for an on site tertiary sewage treatment system. The high quality sewerage works are nearing completion and the system will be commissioned later this year prior to the offices opening.</P>
    <P>The site appraisal also noted that there was a need for water treatment to EU directive standards. The Kiltale group water scheme is upgrading its water supply to meet the EU drinking water directive which came into operation in Ireland in December 2000. The Office of Public Works has provided a stand alone water treatment system on site in Grange and can meet all EU water directive standards independently to any third party water supply, if so required.</P>
    <P>Adequate electricity and telecommunication utilities have been provided for the project. A fibre-optic telecommunication cable was installed 20 months ago. This will enable the office to have the most modern telecommunication system, including video conferencing.</P>
    <P>The European Commission authorities have been kept informed on all these matters during regular meetings and correspondence with Office of Public Works officials.</P>

      <P>To show comparable information across a number of countries I am providing data in the following table on general Government expenditure as a per cent of GDP in all EU countries. Information on trends in the United States and Japan is also included.</P>
      <P>General Government expenditure is the internationally comparable measure used by EUROSTAT and includes all elements of Government spending, that is not just the annual expenditure that is voted by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>As can be seen from this information, general Government expenditure in Ireland is lower than in other EU member states but higher than in the US and Japan. The following points should be noted when comparing the data for the different countries. First, the expenditure ratios for Ireland would increase if they were based on GNP whereas the figures for nearly all of the other EU member states would be largely unaffected. Second, Ireland is at a different stage in its demographic cycle in comparison with the bulk of the other countries. Third, the decreasing trend in expenditure as a per cent of GDP reflects the very large increases in GDP over that period.</P>
      <P>As regards long-term economic development and expansion, I draw the Deputy's attention to the level of and trend in capital spending. Since 1995 capital expenditure as a per cent of GDP in Ireland has increased from 3.9% to 6.2%. These figures are even more significant given the level of GDP growth over that period as they indicate substantially increased funding for capital projects.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that the general Government expenditure figures do not include the 1% of GNP that is being provided for prefunding. The purpose of pre-funding is to use existing resources to build up assets which will part finance the future Exchequer cost of social welfare and public service pensions. From 2025 onwards the State's pensions Bill is expected to rise significantly due to the progressive ageing of the population. The application of resources now to part provide for this large future cost underpins the long-term stability and development of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>Obviously developments in the US economy are important for Ireland since it is a significant destination for our exports and a source of direct investment. A recovery there would therefore impact positively on our economy.</P>
      <P>The recent US economic evidence still points to weakness in the economy. Industrial production fell by 0.8% in May, the eighth straight drop of its kind. This is reflected in a deterioration in labour market conditions and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5%, a two year high. Measures of consumer confidence appear more positive with evidence of a more gentle slowdown while annual GDP growth recovered somewhat to 1.3% in the first quarter of 2001.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Schedule of the Registration of Births Act, 1996, set out the particulars to be registered in respect of the birth of a child registered on or after 1 October 1997. These include a forename and surname for a child. Where a surname assigned to a child is recorded in the register of births, that surname is included in any certificate issued in respect of that entry. Section 1(4) of the Act provides where the birth of a child is being re-registered after the commencement of the Act, and the birth has previously been registered so as to record a surname of the child, the surname to be recorded for the child on re-registration is that which appeared in the original entry.</P>
      <P>The future development of the registration service is being considered in the context of the joint initiative being undertaken by my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to identify and implement the changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events. The review encompasses the structure of registration on a national basis as well as the Acts relating to the registration of vital events. As part of the review process a consultation document was published on 1 May 2001 on the future development of the registration service and to obtain the views of all interested parties. The consultation document indicated that it is intended to provide for a change in the surname of a child where the father's surname is being entered on the register.</P>

      <Quest>his views on a recent statement made in a publication (details supplied) on 6 June 2001, that Ireland could miss out on significant European funding for cancer research because we lack the infrastructure necessary to compete for it.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19130/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cancer strategy recognises that the lack of personnel and organisational factors has meant that participation in clinical research and entry to clinical trials has been limited. The strategy referred to the importance of clinical research to the steady advance in the understanding and treatment of cancer. It pointed out that there is evidence that patients treated in the clinical trial setting have a better outcome overall. It identified that organisational factors and a shortage of personnel has meant that participation in clinical trials had been limited. It suggested that these deficiencies be resolved in the context of the reorganisation of the cancer services proposed in the strategy. It also suggested that there was a clear case for establishing a more formal and co-ordinated approach to clinical research, including clinical trials.</P>
      <P>The co-development of cancer research has been inserted into the Good Friday Agreement. The Memorandum of Understanding on Cancer Research, signed by the British, Irish and US Governments in October 1999, is providing a means to promote an all-island approach to research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising the importance of clinical trials towards improving patient care and the opportunities provided under the memorandum of understanding, the Health Research Board and the Research and Development Office in Northern Ireland proposed to the Cancer Consortium in October 2000 that investment be made to build capacity to participate in clinical trials in hospitals treating cancer patients on this island. An important outcome of this investment will be to <Col N="689" /> enable hospitals in the North and South to participate more in the conduct of clinical trials.</P>
    <P>In 2001 my Department made funding available to the Health Research Board to enable it to hold a competitive call for proposals from hospitals in Ireland to develop their capacity to engage in cancer clinical trials with a view to participation in all-island clinical trials. The purpose of the call for proposals is to build and enhance the capacity of hospitals with significant cancer services to conduct high quality clinical trials of cancer therapies with a view to participation through a reconstituted Irish Clinical Oncology Research Group, ICORG, in all-island clinical trials. Each award of funding under this call will provide a maximum of £400,000 in revenue costs and £100,000 in capital costs. The HRB intends to hold a second call for applications next year.</P>
    <P>Research funding will contribute to a build up of infrastructure and resources to enable further funding to be obtained. The funding from the Programme of Investment in Third Level Institutes, PRTLI, disbursed by the Higher Education Authority will also enhance the research infrastructure. A sum of £162.277 million was allocated in cycle 1 of the programme, much of which will be of benefit to the health system. In particular, the £15.406 million given to the National University of Ireland, Galway to support the establishment of a Centre for Biomedical Engineering Science. The centre will combine the expertise of engineers, medical graduates and scientists to research aspects of major human illness such as cancer, heart disease, bone disease, kidney disease and strokes.</P>
    <P>The HRB awarded £2.782 million for research equipment in 2000. This equipment is used for a wide variety of health research, including research into cancer. In addition, all the HRB's general research schemes provide revenue funding for cancer related research.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new health research strategy, recently approved by Government for publication, contains specific proposals for the development of clinical research centres which would address infrastructural requirements for cancer and other areas. The resources necessary for this strategy will be the subject of discussion between my Department and the Department of Finance in the current Estimates process.</P>
    <P>EU funding is usually supplementary to funding from national sources. Irish researchers have shown commendable skill in accessing EU funding for research. It is important that they continue to participate in EU funded research programmes even when funding available at national level increases significantly.</P>
    <P>Involvement in EU funded projects has wider benefits in terms of co-operation with colleagues in other European countries, the development of training opportunities for young researchers and access to research facilities in other member states. This itself builds up the infrastructure required to gain further research funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health services in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I have drawn this issue to the attention of its regional chief executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Increasing demand as well as difficulties in recruiting physiotherapists has contributed to delays in the provision of physiotherapy services in the ERHA area. The three area health boards are making every effort to address this problem through active recruitment campaigns.</P>
      <P>The study on The Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions for Certain Professional Therapists, which my Department commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to conduct, is currently under consideration. Among the issues addressed by this study is the number of additional training places required for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. Through the Higher Education Authority, the possibility of increasing the number of training colleges, as well as training places, will also be addressed.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, following contacts between the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Education and Science and the HEA, the number of physiotherapist training places was increased by 52 from October 2000.</P>
      <P>The expert group report on various health professions reported in April 2000. It recommended that talks begin between the parties on the establishment of a new grade of clinical specialist in the therapy grades. Following discussions between IMPACT, the Health Service Employers Agency and officials of my Department employers were advised recently of the creation of this new grade.</P>
      <P>The establishment of this new grade allows for the recognition and reward of those with a high degree of clinical expertise. By providing an avenue of career progression for those who do not wish to move into management, it will also serve as a retention mechanism.</P>
      <P>Health boards and other health agencies have been notified of their allocation of posts, along with details of qualifying criteria and post responsibilities to enable them to draw up individual job descriptions for the posts. The operation of these new posts will be the subject of an evaluation process after 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the implementation of the expert group, the criteria for the upgrading of therapists from basic grade to senior have been improved. On this basis a survey of all health service employers was undertaken to identify posts which would meet these new criteria. Last December sanction was given for the upgrading of these <Col N="691" /> posts. Approximately half of all basic grade therapy posts were upgraded through this process.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue funding provided to services for older people has been increased significantly in recent years from £3 million in 1997 to an additional £7 million in 1998, an additional £12 million in 1999, an additional £28.5 million in 2000. In 2001 an additional £37 million will be provided. When nursing home subventions are included the investment for 2001 will total over £51 million.</P>
    <P>A proportion of the development funding available this year has been targeted at the provision of additional community supports, that is nursing and paramedical posts. It is intended to improve these community supports in the coming years, leading to an enhancement of service provision. Additional funding of more than £14 million was allocated to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001 for the further development of services for older people throughout Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. As much as £1.65 million of this allocation was provided for improvements in community supports.</P>
    <P>This Government has also significantly increased funding for physical and sensory disability services. Since coming to office it has provided additional funding of just more than £107 million for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. This additional funding includes a total of approximately £55 million additional ongoing revenue, of which £5 million was provided in 1998, £9 million in 1999, £17.823 million in 2000 and just under £23 million this year, for the maintenance and development of services, including paramedical services, for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services in the sector are decided by the health boards, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are <Col N="694" /> exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) ( No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the health boards that the information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>The ERHA has advised that nursing home contract beds are allocated to the acute hospitals as soon as they become vacant. The length of time it takes for the hospitals to fill these beds varies from 24 hours to a fortnight depending on why patients are currently in the hospital and whether the contract bed is suitable for any of their current patients. If they have no suitable patients at a given time the bed is returned to the nursing homes section and it will be allocated to either another acute hospital or to somebody on the contract bed waiting list.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the North-Western Health Board that occasionally contract beds may be vacant for up to a maximum of two weeks. The board advises that this may be for a number of reasons including nobody wishing to avail of the bed at the time; it may not be the choice of an individual to go to a particular nursing home, that is the home may not be near an individual's family; or seasonal factors when demand fluctuates, that is higher demand in winter months.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board have advised that as contract beds are assigned on a case by case basis, they are not left vacant. The North-Eastern Health Board has also advised that contract beds are not left vacant.</P>
      <P>Apart from beds contracted as part of the winter initiative which ended on 31 March, the Midland Health Board, the Mid-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board have no contract beds.</P>

      <P>The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes, as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is twofold. First, they must ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes. Second, they must operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care.</P>
      <P>Under the Nursing Homes Act health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency.</P>
      <P>Articles 30(b) and 31 of the Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations state that the registered proprietor and the person in charge of the nursing home shall ensure that when a person requires physiotherapy, occupational therapy or other health service such service is made available by the registered proprietor or by arrangement with the health board. These services may be provided by a health board to a nursing home at the request of the registered proprietor or person in charge upon such terms, charges and conditions and to such extent as the health board may determine, following discussion with the registered proprietor of the home. It is also open to a patient to make private arrangements for the provision of these services if they so wish.</P>

      <P>Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, provides that individuals resident in private nursing homes who are in receipt of a subvention from the health board may not be charged extra for any service which is considered to be essential to their maintenance in the home and common practice in most nursing homes. Such services include bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency of the person and incontinence wear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements are currently in place for the supply of incontinence wear by health boards to medical card holders living in the community. On 26 February, on the instructions of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, a letter was issued to the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority requesting that the boards ensure that medical card holders who have entered, or will enter, private nursing homes, retain their eligibility for incontinence wear under the GMS scheme. It also requested that all medical card holders in receipt of a subvention <Col N="696" /> be supplied with incontinence wear on the same basis as if they were residing in the community.</P>
    <P>This request has logistical implications for the boards, including assessment and distribution issues. I will ask the health boards and the Eastern Regional Authority to put the arrangements in place as a matter of urgency. In the meantime incontinence wear should still be supplied by private nursing home owners as provided for in Article 16.1 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 70 years and over wishing to avail of automatic eligibility for a medical card will have to complete an application form to obtain it. A new application form has been designed for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The automatic right to eligibility is confined to the person in the relevant age category. The provision does not extend to dependants below the age of 70 years. Persons aged 70 years and over retain the option of applying for a medical card in the normal way. If their application is successful the medical card would extend to any dependants, irrespective of age, as is currently the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on the introduction of the new arrangements are continuing with the Irish Medical Organisation and they resumed this afternoon. I hope that agreement will be reached. However, it would be unhelpful to speculate on what arrangements might be put in place in regard to reimbursement of fees and access to free drugs in the event that there is no resolution. <Col N="697" /> One of the issues being addressed in these negotiations relates to the position of general practitioners who do not currently hold General Medical Service contracts.</P>
    <P>Health boards have been formally advised of ongoing developments in this area from January. They have readied their administrative processes to deal with the applications that will be made. They may issue medical card application forms to any persons requesting them, including persons aged 70 and over. Applications will be processed as quickly as possible. Any benefits attaching to a medical card for a person benefiting from the new provision cannot be effective until after 1 July.</P>
    <P>As part of the commitment towards greater transparency all circulars issued in relation to the GMS scheme are placed for public view on the relevant website www.GPIT.ie/eGMS. The same will be done with circulars issued to health boards that are connected to the contractual aspects of implementing this new provision.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>It will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million will fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million was for the orthodontic initiative. The ERHA's chief executive officer has advised me of the following developments in the region in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: Two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed, the first has been assigned to the East Coast Area Health Board and the second will take up duty next September in the South-Western Area Health Board; the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is currently in train; two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more; the recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed; two of the managers will commence duty in July and the third will take up duty <Col N="699" /> in August; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised; a competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards is being organised; a competition to fill the posts of dental hygienist in the area health boards will commence shortly; the previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St. James's Hospital unit has been filled; a similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a locum basis; a six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed; the Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital; validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress; agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics; and four dentists from the ERHA will commence training in 2001.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of additional clinical staff has allowed treatment to commence or recommence for approximately 1,150 patients in the ERHA. The initiative in the authority will enable an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>The proposal from the ERHA for a grant-in-aid scheme was approved by my Department. I am informed by the ERHA's chief executive officer that the working group established in the Northern Area Health Board to report on the pilot scheme's implementation are continuing to consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the legal implications of the scheme.</P>

However, comparing the nearest available baseline figures, those for the three month period ended June 1997, with the most recently published figures, those from the quarter ended 31 December last, indicates that average new house prices increased during the relevant four years by 80% and average second hand prices by just over 100%.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that house price increases are continuing to moderate since house price inflation peaked in 1998.

      <P>I recognise that unauthorised encampments continue to be a source of concern and contention for both the Traveller and settled <Col N="703" /> communities. However, the increased provision of accommodation, including the provision of transient sites, resulting from the implementation of the five-year local Traveller accommodation programmes under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, is assigned greatly to reduce the incidence of illegal encampments.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a range of powers in relation to unauthorised Traveller encampments on public land and on the roadside: section 32 of the 1998 Act as regards encampments which are located within specified distances of Traveller accommodation provided by any housing authority or voluntary body with the assistance of a housing authority, or which are in poor condition or interfere with amenities or are likely to be or are a risk to personal or public health or safety; the Planning Acts in relation to unauthorised development and the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, in relation to the prohibition of temporary dwellings in certain areas.</P>
      <P>There are further powers and controls under environmental, litter and public health legislation and the legislation relating to the control of dogs and horses. Under the Roads Acts, vehicles must not be parked in a manner which interferes with the normal flow of traffic or which obstructs or endangers other traffic. The Road Traffic Act, 1961, expressly prohibits the parking of a vehicle in a dangerous manner.</P>
      <P>The Committee to Monitor and Co-ordinate the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community recommends, in its First Progress Report, that the operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, Act, should be reviewed in 2002, two years into the delivery of the Traveller accommodation programmes. Any review would therefore include the provisions for dealing with unauthorised encampments as well as the arrangements for the preparation and implementation of all elements of the local Traveller accommodation programmes. Arrangements for carrying out such a review will be considered in due course.</P>

      <Quest>if the rates of compensation payable to property owners where property is being acquired by compulsory purchase order, to facilitate the provision of infrastructural projects on a commercial or other basis through public private partnerships and other means will be reviewed and the legislation governing compulsory purchase orders will be amended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes, on the <Col N="704" /> basis of fair compensation to landowners, has operated widely in Ireland for many years and is supported by the Constitution and a range of legislative proposals which have been regularly upheld by the courts. It is a basic principle within this process that landowners must get fair compensation and that it should be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Compensation is comprised of a number of elements. The fundamental point of reference is the market value of the land. Compensatory provision is also made for disturbance, severance and injurious affection; these in certain circumstances would exceed the land value element of the total compensation package. In addition, accommodation works such as underpasses are also catered for. Where a dispute arises about compensation the matter is referable to an independent arbitrator.</P>
      <P>Compulsory acquisition of land for a road project to be provided under a public private partnership, PPP, does not alter the application of the above arrangements and principles. Under present arrangements, land in such areas will be acquired by and remain in the ownership of, the local road authority. The new road facility will be a public one, with the revenue from user fees defraying part only of the costs of construction, operation and maintenance.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to a fair and equitable compulsory purchase process. The Government is also concerned that the national development programme should be delivered on time and cost effectively so that the country as a whole can enjoy sustained economic growth and more balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>The proposals published by the IFA for amendment of the arrangements for compulsory acquisition of land have been discussed on a number of occasions between IFA and the Department of the Environment and Local Government and other relevant agencies, including the National Roads Authority. These discussions have taken place in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to the &ldquo;fair and efficient implementation of compulsory purchase orders&rdquo;, and are continuing. Pending the completion of these discussions, I do not propose to comment on particular details of the IFA proposals.</P>

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes are designed to recognise the articular difficulties that arise following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>Since April of this year the maximum rate of widow(er)'s contributory pension has been £89.10 per week for those aged under 66 years of age. The corresponding rate of widow(er)'s non-contributory pension is £85.50 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the Government's commitment to pensioners and as announced in Budget 2001, I decided to increase the widow(er)'s contributory pension for recipients aged 66 or over to the full old age contributory pension rate over two budgets. The special increase of £12.90 per week which came into effect in April is the first step in this process. The maximum rate of widow(er)'s con<Col N="707" /> tributory pension is now £102 per week for those aged over 66. The corresponding rate of widow(er)'s non-contributory pension is £95.50.</P>
    <P>The increases in the rates of child benefit which came into effect this month are of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Monthly child benefit payments are now £67.50 per month for each of the first and second children and £86 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>Widow(er)s are also benefiting from changes in the free schemes which I announced in Budget 2001 and which came into effect in May. Under these new arrangements all persons aged over 70 years of age are entitled to the full range of schemes regardless of their means or household composition.</P>
    <P>A working group was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to examine the range of issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. The level of payments to widow/ers will be examined in the context of that working group.</P>
    <P>In addition, the position with regard to social welfare provision for widowed people will be kept under review in the context of overall Budgetary considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The treatment benefits scheme administered by my Department provides assistance towards the cost of dental, optical and audiology services to people, and their dependent spouses, who satisfy the relevant statutory PRSI conditions. The scheme is a contributory social insurance scheme and the qualifying conditions are set at a level which maintains a reasonable balance between social insurance contributions received and the costs of the benefits concerned.</P>
      <P>The PRSI contributions which are reckonable for treatment benefit are classes A, E, H and P.</P>
      <P>The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to treatment benefits vary depending on the age of the insured person. Persons must also have been insurably employed and paid appropriate rates of PRSI for a certain length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65 years of age the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. However, if a person satisfies the qualifying conditions on reaching age 60 that person will remain qualified for life. Those in the 61 to 65 age group are required to satisfy the requirements as outlined for the 25 to 65 age group <Col N="708" /> above if they do not meet the qualifying conditions at age 60.</P>
    <P>However, a person who retires on grounds of ill health, or who is deemed to be unemployed, may apply for disability or unemployment benefit, subject to satisfying the statutory conditions. In addition to any payments that may be due, entitlement to such benefits may also result in the award of credited contributions which can be taken into account to extend coverage for treatment benefits for further periods.</P>
    <P>The relevant tax year for persons making claims in the year 2001 is 1999-2000. This would also be the relevant tax year for persons taking early retirement in the year 2001.</P>
    <P>For persons aged 66 and over the contribution requirements vary depending on when age 66 was reached. These are for persons aged 66: before 1 October, 1987 156 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 26 weeks paid or credited in either of the two complete tax years before age 66; between 1 October 1987 and 6 July 1992 208 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks paid or credited in either of the last two complete tax years before age 66; after 6 July 1992 260 weeks paid since first starting work and 39 weeks paid or credited in either of the last two complete tax years before age 66.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, in 1998, I formally declared Ireland's sixth national park, comprising 11,000 hectares of land, in north-west Mayo. This land comprises some of the most important Atlantic blanket bog in Europe. The new national park complements very well the five long-standing national parks at Killarney, Wicklow, Glenveagh, Connemara and the Burren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a critical input to the development of this new national park, I allocated £3 million under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, towards the construction of a visitor centre in Ballcroy, County Mayo, to serve the new national park, and a site has recently been purchased for this centre. The proposals for this new visitor centre will now be developed in close consultation with the local community and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, following the lifting of travel restrictions associated with the recent foot and mouth disease precautions, this consultative process will re-commence on 28 June 2001 when officials of my Department will attend a meeting in Lagduff of the working group for the new national park in North West Mayo. The working group, which was established by me to pioneer the <Col N="709" /> venture, also comprises representatives of local community groups, Mayo County Council and the Office of Public Works. It is the intention that the working group will now proceed to progress this important project and, once the brief for the new visitor centre has been agreed, the normal process of design, planning permission, tendering and construction will follow.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to develop any other national parks at present, but will continue my policy to conserve and protect the natural heritage and also to enhance the visitor facilities at the State's six national parks in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>On the subject of stately homes, I should inform the Deputy that my brief and that of my Department is confined to management of historic properties in State care which are recognised as being of national or international significance from a heritage viewpoint. The current portfolio of historic properties includes those as diverse as Castletown House, Kilkenny Castle, Emo Court, Derrynane House and Rathfarnham Castle. There is an ongoing programme of maintenance and restoration works at these properties, and the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, provides for the following major projects: Castletown House, County Kildare &ndash; £7.1 million; Fota House, County Cork &ndash; £0.5 million; St. Enda's Rathfarnham &ndash; £1 million; Kilmacurragh, County Wicklow &ndash; £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, extensive restoration works were recently completed at Kilkenny Castle and Rathfarnham Castle under the EU operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
    <P>It has to be stated that, given the existing extensive range of heritage properties already in the portfolio of my Department, and the scarce resources available to manage that portfolio, the ability of my Department to take on responsibility for additional heritage properties is extremely limited. However, in exceptional circumstances, consideration is given to acquiring additional properties, having regard to their national or international significance and considering their fit within the current extensive portfolio of properties.</P>

      <P>Development applications that impact on archaeological sites and monuments are referred by the relevant local authority to my Department for comment and recommendation. The proposed development referred to by the Deputy has been forwarded to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department and it was recommended by Dúchas that fundamental re-design and substantial archaeological investigation be carried out. Further information was requested by Limerick Corporation but the response received did not deal adequately with the archaeological issues raised. However, the developer has since employed a consultant archaeologist to assess the development impacts and my Department is awaiting this report for appraisal. I am, therefore, not in a position to comment on the archaeological implications until my officials have assessed this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's publication &ldquo;Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage&rdquo; sets out broad principles for protecting archaeological sites and monuments. Part III of this publication outlines the principles for the protection of the archaeological heritage. In summary, they state that the archaeological heritage is a non-renewable resource and the first option in all circumstances must be non-destructive investigation and study. Furthermore, there should always be a presumption in favour of avoiding development impacts on the archaeological <Col N="711" /> heritage so that preservation, <i>in situ</i>, is the preferred approach.</P>

      <P>With regard to plans for development at the Cultural Institutions, the refurbishment of the former National College of Art and Design for the National Library of Ireland is almost complete and a new off-site storage facility has been provided at City West.

However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage.

      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in 1999 launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum.

      <P>Finally, the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <Quest>the mechanisms in place with Northern Ireland to support exchange of experience and knowledge on equality matters; the lessons learned from the Northern Ireland experience which is informing policy development here; and the joint initiatives which are in place or planned.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of the equality agenda in both Northern Ireland and here in the South has been acknowledged by the inclusion in the Good Friday Agreement of commitments in relation to equality although as the Deputy is aware there are no joint North-South <Col N="713" /> bodies in relation to equality. A number of mechanisms have been put in place to support exchange of experience and knowledge in relation to equality issues. In addition informal contacts take place between Northern and Southern officials for the purposes of sharing knowledge and experience.</P>
      <P>As recommended in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department convened a working group on equality proofing in October 2000 to provide an ongoing focus on equality proofing issues. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland is represented on my Department's equality proofing working group.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act, 1998, places a statutory requirement on public authorities there to conduct equality impact assessments of their policies. Given that in Northern Ireland a statutory duty has been laid down in this area while, in this jurisdiction, a non-statutory approach is being adopted, I believe fruitful comparisons can be made. It is an area where I hope that my Department and the Equality bodies here can benefit from the experience of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Strategies for exchange of experience and joint action on equality proofing on a North-South basis would thus make a significant contribution to the learning required for us to progress equality proofing.</P>
      <P>In December, 2000, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland commenced a project to prepare accessible practical guidance on equality impact assessment for use by public authorities, voluntary and community organisations, trade unions and other bodies in Northern Ireland affected by the statutory duties. My Department participated in the Equality Commission's advisory group which assisted on this project and an officer of my Department attended the periodic meetings of the group.</P>
      <P>The NDP gender equality unit in my Department, which supports gender mainstreaming of the NDP, has played a lead role in setting up a &ldquo;celtic fringe&rdquo; network of those working to mainstream policies in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England. This network includes representatives of our NDP gender equality unit and the Equality Authority and of the Equality Commission and gender policy unit in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland. This network aims to exchange experiences and develop best practice in relation to mainstreaming between Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the other regions involved. This network has already met once and is setting up an e-mailing list to facilitate exchange of information between participants. Future work together may include a publication outlining best practice examples of mainstreaming, and a conference on implementation of mainstreaming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the &ldquo;equality for women&rdquo; measure of the NDP I have approved funding for a project to build capacity and strengthen networking among <Col N="714" /> women's NGO's to support the involvement of diverse women in the context of the Beijing Platform for Action on gender equality and within a human rights framework generally.</P>
    <P>My Department is planning to work with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland on an initiative concerning the male-female wage differential.</P>
    <P>The Equality Authority and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland have agreed themes for co-operation. These are: mainstreaming equality; the integrated equality agenda; EU Structural Funds allocation.</P>
    <P>A separate chapter in the strategic plan of the Equality Authority is dedicated to this co-operation.</P>
    <P>Both bodies have established a joint working group to progress this co-operation. This involves the chairperson and chief executive of each body.</P>
    <P>A first joint venture of the two bodies was launched in Belfast on the 25th of this month. This is a research project examining the most effective ways of managing and bringing forward a multi-ground equality agenda. The research will help set an agenda for future joint work in this area as well as establishing a common framework within which each body will be developing its work.</P>
    <P>The new EU EQUAL Community Initiative which was launched in Ireland earlier this month addresses discrimination and inequality in the labour market. It gives some priority to ensuring mainstreaming of the lessons for policy and provision in this area from the projects to be selected. Mainstreaming is identified as having a North-South dimension and the Equality Authority and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland are identified as key actors for this mainstreaming. They are currently exploring how most effectively to approach this task together.</P>
    <P>The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland is represented on the Board of the National Consultative Committee for Racism and Interculturalism, NCCRI.</P>
    <P>The NCCRI has worked in partnership with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and with community organisations such as NICEM, Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities, to develop a North/South dimension to addressing racism. Outcomes of this process to date include: the hosting of a North/South roundtable on racism in Dundalk in 1999; the publication of an approach to developing anti-racism strategies on a North-South basis in partnership with the Equality Commission, NI, &ldquo;Developing a North/South Agenda for Anti-Racism and Racial Equality Strategies&rdquo;; a co-ordinated North-South approach to International Day Against Racism in 2001, with over 50 initiatives organised by Government and Non-Government agencies; and the publication of &ldquo;Raising Awareness &ndash; Diversity and Racism&rdquo;, an anti-racism education pack for schools developed jointly by NCCRI and the Equality Commission, NI.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> The Office of the Director of Equality Investigations has issued invitations to the Presidents of the Industrial Tribunals of Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England and Wales to participate in a North-South-East-West forum to discuss items of mutual interest. The President of the Industrial Tribunal in Northern Ireland has already indicated his agreement to participate in such a forum.</P>
    <P>In addition to these mechanisms, other exchanges of knowledge and experience take place from time to time, for example, officials from my Department, the Director of Equality Investigations and the Equality Authority participated in a function for equality bodies organised in Belfast in June 2000 by the British-Irish secretariat. Senior Officials from my Department and a Senior Official from the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister recently addressed the North-South Implementation Bodies in Armagh in relation to equality legalisation in place in Northern Ireland and here in the South.</P>
    <P>The Director of Equality Investigations and the chief executive officer of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland have had a number of meetings to discuss items of mutual concern. There is also significant informal contact between the two organisations, including visits by staff members.</P>
    <P>The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland receives copies of all decisions issued by the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. The office of the director monitors equality decisions from Northern Ireland Tribunals, where these are made publicly available. These are accorded persuasive status where appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the mechanisms that have been put in place together with the informal contacts between officials responsible for equality matters on the island of Ireland are resulting in mutual benefit in the area of equality.</P>
    <P>The issue of religious and political discrimination is of course of major significance in Northern Ireland. This is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs who maintains regular contact with the British Government on the matter through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources to individual areas, that public access call boxes, &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo;, were installed in unattended Garda stations in 1983. While the systems worked similar to a telephone system, that is door phone &ndash; they were in fact operated over the national radio system installed at that time and didn't utilise telephone lines. The system provided the public with a means of contacting the Garda at the nearest district 24 hour station from an unattended sub-district Garda station. Although not used a great deal the system performed well technically in the 470 sub-district stations so equipped. The original equipment is now obsolete and spares are unavailable, thus making it difficult to maintain.</P>
      <P>However, plans are well advanced to replace the systems with more equipment based on GSM technology. A pilot system based on this technology has been installed and is operating very successfully in Kinsale Garda station for a considerable time. A second unit is being installed in Longwood Garda station, County Meath, for evaluation after which a national system will be tendered for and installed by mid 2002.</P>
      <P>All calls made on the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; system of a report type nature are recorded upon receipt in the local divisional communications room or district stations.</P>
      <P>The nature and urgency of a call will dictate how it is dealt with.</P>
      <P>An urgent call will be dealt with immediately from available resources. A low priority call would be passed on to the members with the responsibility for the sub-station to which the call relates.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware it has been Government policy to extend the Freedom Of Information, FOI, Act on an incremental basis. In the context of this ongoing programme, all Departments were asked by the Department of Finance to identify additional bodies to be brought within the scope of the FOI having regard to the criteria contained in paragraph 1(5) of the First Schedule to the FOI Act. To assist Departments in identifying their priorities in this regard, the Department of Finance asked them to consider in particular bodies in receipt of or administering significant public funds, bodies exercising important statutory functions, bodies in a category or sector where FOI already applies and bodies where previous undertakings in relation to their inclusion under FOI had already been given.</P>
      <P>In response to that request, my Department has recommended that Bord Fáilte, CERT and Area Development Management Limited should be brought within the scope of FOI. The Irish Sports Council is already covered and I understand that the Department of the Taoiseach had already recommended that Campus and Stadium Ireland Development be included prior to responsibility for the company transferring to my Department.</P>
      <P>As part of the ongoing roll-out of FOI, my Department will be examining the possibility of extending FOI to other bodies.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sports capital programme administered by my Department provides funding to voluntary and community organisations throughout the country. One of its main objectives is to assist such organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; with the proviso that the facilities should be high quality, safe, well designed and sustainable to both the user and the provider. It is, of course, open to organisations representing the handicapped or disabled to apply for funding under the programme.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that grant-aided projects must ensure that suitable access is provided for the disabled to buildings.</P>
      <P>I have allocated approximately £102 million to 2,021 projects under the programme over the past four years, including £40 million to 680 projects in 2001, which, for example included £750,000 to the Irish Wheelchair Association, £15,000 for the Ard na Seaghsa centre in Boyle, County Roscommon and £20,000 to the Irish Basketball Association for the provision of a lift for the disabled at the National Basketball Arena in Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The latter facility will be used as one of the 18 centres which will host events in the 2003 World Special Olympic Games, due to be held in Ireland for the first time. Other improvements which are being made in facilities for the World Special Olympics include the 50 metre swimming pool which is being built as part of the Aquatic Centre at Sports Campus Ireland, Abbotstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my <Col N="720" /> Department, the Government has provided £45 million funding over the three year period 2000-2002, effectively increasing the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million over these three years. All proposals for funding under this programme must include provision and access for the disabled.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, the Irish Sports Council provides funding for promotion and development of sport to the Irish Paralympic Council and to the following organisations:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, that the provision of open spaces, recreational and sports facilities and amenity areas specifically in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile, my Department provides substantial funding under its sports capital programmes to assist organisations, clubs, community groups and local authorities in the provision of sport and recreational facilities to cater for a broad spectrum of sports and activities for all age groups and levels of participation, at national, regional and local levels. Since taking office, I have allo<Col N="721" /> cated around £102 million to more than 2,020 projects in cities, towns and villages. Over the three years of the previous Government, only £18 million was allocated to such projects.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, and specifically to assist the local authorities in the provision of good quality swimming pools for their local communities, I increased the annual budget of £3 million provided by the previous Government to a funding package of £45 million for the three year period 2000-02.</P>
    <P>The young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 for the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas and to date approximately £46 million has been allocated to support more than 340 facility or service projects in these areas. Under this year's sports capital programme alone I allocated another £23.5 million to 370 sport and recreational facilities in designated disadvantaged areas in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>With other funding provided by my Department, the Irish Sports Council operates a range of programmes with national governing bodies and other organisations aimed at providing enhanced opportunities for all, including young people, to participate in sport and recreation. The council is piloting eight local sports partnerships as a further means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level and in increasing participation in sport. The council is also working with the GAA, FAI and IRFU in the implementation of special initiatives both in identified areas of disadvantage and in the wider community, to promote and develop greater opportunities and increased involvement of children and young people in sport and recreation.</P>

All of the applications were assessed in accordance with assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme.</P>
      <P>Following the assessment process, the organisation in question was unsuccessful on this occasion and this decision, together with a copy of the assessment conducted on the application, was conveyed to the organisation by letter dated 13 June 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national reading initiative was launched on 21 January 2000, with a budget of £2,500,000, as a one year initiative with two briefs: to raise awareness in the general public of the importance of reading and to lay the foundation for improving the quality of the teaching of reading in the formal and non-formal sectors.</P>
      <P>The initiative was a community-wide endeavour, involving my Department collaborating with schools, libraries and voluntary community groups. Opportunity was given to local groups across all sectors to apply for funding to design, organise and run community-based projects aimed at increasing reading use and/or improving reading standards.</P>
      <P>One of the national projects funded by the initiative was &ldquo;Babies Love Books&rdquo;. This project involved providing every child born in 2000 with a gift pack of five quality books including guidelines for parents/carers on how best to share books with babies. An additional two Irish language books were provided to children of Irish speaking families. My Department organised the selection and purchase of the books and these books were then forwarded to the county libraries.</P>
      <P>Each library authority undertook to manage the project at local level, taking responsibility for the storage, collation and distribution of the year's supply of packs for the relevant county. The library authorities at local level liaised with the public health centres in their areas and made local arrangements for the distribution of the book packs at the baby's nine-month developmental check up. Altogether, 60,000 packs were distributed by the libraries and health centres and I am pleased to acknowledge the great commitment given by the library and health board staff in managing this project.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there was a difficulty with the provision of packs to the health centre referred to in the Deputy's question. Any health centre, which has experienced a shortfall in supply, should notify their local library immediately in order that the matter may be addressed. I have made provision for funding to be provided in 2001 for the completion of all national reading initiative projects and I can assure the Deputy that any difficulties that are identified by the libraries can be considered in consultation with them.</P>

My Department expects to issue the 2001 higher education grants scheme shortly, with details of revised rates of maintenance grants and revised income limits.</P>
      <P>I announced, late last year, that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students.</P>
      <P>This review, which is at present in progress, is a wide-ranging review to include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation.</P>
      <P>Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. For example, costings of the effect of changes in the income limits, below which applicants become eligible for a grant, have been commissioned, and carried out, for the special review. Notwithstanding this, however, I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</P>

      <P>Last August I announced my plans to strengthen the education base in regions which are not well served at present and to establish effective links with higher and further education institutions. My intention is to address the related problems of non-completion at second-level and low participation rates in higher education, which are hampering development in these regions. I intend to put in place supports to encourage completion of the leaving certificate and to enable advancement to localised further and higher education opportunities.</P>
      <P>Following my announcement, the Ferns diocesan authorities offered St. Peter's College, Wexford, as a location to facilitate development of a centre with higher education links. When I visited Wexford on 30 August last, I indicated that I was prepared to provide funding to establish a Reach-out centre at St. Peter's College. I indicated that I envisaged the proposed centre as having a local management body and a dedicated budget. I also identified the need for a project plan as a necessary preliminary to the establishment of the proposed centre. I suggested that a local co-ordinator-director be appointed to drive the project and draw up a project plan. At the request of the local steering committee, I asked the director of the Institute of Technology, Carlow and Wexford County Manager to submit a proposal to my Department in this regard, which they duly did.</P>
      <P>I also met with local representatives in Kilkenny last August. Both the National University of Ireland, NUI, in Maynooth and the Institute of Technology, Carlow are involved in separate provision in the city. A detailed strategic plan for the development of the Kilkenny campus was sent to the Higher Education Authority. Pending discussions of the proposal with representatives of NUI Maynooth, the Higher Education Authority allocated £150,000 to the project in December 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussion of the plan with representatives of the university, the Higher Education Authority provided detailed advice to my Department at the end of January on the general question of Reach-out provision and on the spec<Col N="732" /> ific issue of the university's involvement in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Department of Finance are engaged in ongoing discussions regarding the appointment of staff to progress my proposals at the local level.</P>

      <P>Many children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and/or special needs assistant services.</P>
      <P>In October 1998 the Government decided that all children with special needs, including children suffering from the condition to which the Deputy refers, should henceforth be entitled to an automatic response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers supporting such children has been increased from 104 to more than 950. The number of special needs assistants has been increased from less than 300 to more than 2000 over the same period. Additional such resources are being deployed on an ongoing basis as further needs are identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the level of the disorder in question is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special classes in special schools or attached to ordinary primary schools. All such facilities operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 <Col N="733" /> and children attending such classes attract a special rate of capitation funding.</P>
    <P>The resources available to my Department to support children with special needs, including children with the condition in question, are focused on the development of in-school services.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 380 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 357 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the school has a special class teacher and a resource teacher.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by my Department if the schools meet the defined criteria. This school did not meet the requirements under these criteria.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, at this time, it is not possible to sanction the retention of the 13th mainstream teaching post for the school year 2001-02 as the schools' September 2000 enrolment does not meet the retention requirement of 360 pupils.</P>

      <P>South Tipperary was selected by my Department in 1990 as part of the pilot project introducing the psychological service to primary schools. These schools were among the first in the country to have such a service. Currently one NEPS psychologist serves all post-primary schools in the region and two others serve all 90 primary schools.</P>
      <P>The service will be gradually extended on a national basis over the next few years in accordance with the NEPS development plan. The development plan envisages the appointment of a total of 4.5 psychologists to this area.</P>
      <P>A new competition for NEPS psychologists is likely to take place in the near future and it is intended to prioritise south Tipperary in the advertisement for the competition.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the allocation of funding to enable NEPS to develop a scheme for commissioning psychological assessments pending the full expansion of its service to schools. Details of this scheme will issue shortly to all primary schools.</P>
