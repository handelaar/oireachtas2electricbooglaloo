    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be No. 26, Motion re: Referral to Joint Committee of Report of the Ombudsman on Nursing Home Subventions; No. 6, Valuation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 7 &ndash; Local Government Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage and No. 53 Statements on the Report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the Review of EU Legislation, to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 25 shall be decided without debate and the proceedings on No. 53, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of the Chairperson of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and of the main spokespersons for the Government and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; the statement of each Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes and Members may share time.</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 26 agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is asked to refer No. 26 to a committee and following an instruction to that effect the committee is obligated to debate the report. This goes to the heart of the relationship, debated in many Parliaments, between the powers of the Executive or Cabinet and the committees of the House. If I interpret this correctly, will the Taoiseach explain how the Labour Party Private Members' Bill on corporate donations, which was referred to a committee of the House, is not within the remit of the committee to debate? A member of the Cabinet or the Executive now purports to frustrate the committee by issuing an instruction to the chairman not to debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> If the House decides to refer a matter to a committee then under a real committee system it takes charge of the matter on behalf of the House and will process it as it sees fit. For the Executive to interfere and attempt to instruct a committee chairman to do otherwise is a disgrace. It is a pulling back from the powers of the committee. I seek clarification on this matter in the context of No. 26. There is no point in referring items to a committee if members of the Executive can unilaterally write letters to the chairmen and seek to negative the reference made by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach had time to reflect on his position on this matter? As the Government has seen fit to move, in the name of a Minister of State, a Fine Gael Party motion on Standing Orders in Government time, which will require debate, will he indicate if the Government is now prepared to pass, with or without debate, a Labour Party motion requiring the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government to report to the House by the end of this session on 12 April, on the Bill which provides for the banning of corporate donations? If the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who is responsible for local democracy, is prepared to allow democracy at national level to prevail and to allow Committee Stage for the relevant Bill to take place, will the Taoiseach indicate if he is prepared to allow the select committee to do its business as charged and not allow the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to exercise a veto?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy Quinn's question is no. The Electoral Bill will shortly be introduced to the Seanad. With regard to Deputy Noonan's question, the Ombudsman's report on nursing home subventions will be sent to the relevant joint committee for consideration. It is a <Col N="947" /> long established precedent that if the Government introduces a Bill following on the introduction of a Private Members' Bill, the Government Bill is given precedence. Deputy Noonan will recall many such instances. For example, when the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform was in Opposition he introduced a number of Bills at the time of the death of Veronica Guerin, but they were set aside by the relevant committee while the Government introduced its legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy. I would not dare to do so. I want to be helpful to Deputy Noonan. What is happening in this case is that an important report from the Ombudsman is going before the committee for debate but the legislation, in accordance with precedence, will be dealt with in exactly the same way it always has been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once a matter is referred by the House to a committee, such as the one being referred under No. 26, does a member of the Cabinet have the right to direct the committee not to deal with it? I do not believe that should be the case in any proper committee system nor do I believe the chairman of the committee in question, Deputy Healy-Rae, should be the puppet of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach outlined his view on Standing Orders and stated that the reason the Government is not prepared to debate Committee Stage of a particular piece of legislation is that an alternative Bill which is due to go before the Seanad shortly will deal with the subject matter of the aforementioned legislation. As the chairperson of this House, will the Ceann Comhairle inform me how a Bill which passed Second Stage, the net point of which was to ban corporate donations, can be subjected to an amendment of such a substantial nature that it plans to legalise corporate donations of £20,000? That is not an amendment, it is a substantial change. If the Fianna Fáil Party is opposed to corporate donations, why did it not have the courage to vote against them earlier last year?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue, being the first comprehensive valuation legislation introduced since the 1850s. It is designed to improve, streamline and modernise the operation of the valuation system which was the basis for the collection of £456 million in local authority rates in 2000. The new legislation removes deficiencies that have built up over the years in the valuation system, brings the system into line with the contemporary commercial environment and makes it more transparent and equitable for the ratepayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key motivation for introducing the legislation is to allow a revaluation of commercial and industrial properties to take place in all rating authority areas over a period of years. A national revaluation has not been undertaken since the middle of the 19th century. The world has changed a lot since then and the bulk of the existing legislation was not designed to deal with the rapid pace of expansion, development and change that is a feature of our modern economy. A <Col N="960" /> revaluation will allow a uniform and equitable valuation base to be established and anomalies to be removed. It will facilitate a return to the use of full net annual values rather than the confusing fractions arrangement that is operated at present.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for regular revaluations to be undertaken in all local authority areas. This measure will ensure that valuations are kept in line with changes in market values and provide for fairness and equity between ratepayers. Furthermore, the new legislation enhances the opportunities for ratepayers to be involved in the valuation process from an early stage. In addition to retaining the existing multi-tiered appeals system, it introduces a new consultative phase at the initial stage of the valuation process. The consultative phase means that, in future, ratepayers will be notified of the Valuation Office's proposed determination in respect of their property before it becomes effective for rating purposes. Ratepayers will then be given an opportunity to make a submission to the Valuation Office about that determination if they so wish. The Valuation Office is obliged to take a submission into account before the valuation certificate is issued and the valuation list amended or published.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that increasing local authorities' rates income through a revaluation is not the purpose of the new legislation. In order to put this beyond doubt, provision is made for the capping of the increase in the overall rates income of a rating authority area in the year in which the first revaluation is used for rating purposes to the increase in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive legislation which provides for the repeal of existing valuation legislation and its replacement by modern legislation for those elements of the current valuation system it is proposed to retain and a revaluation of all rateable property in the country on a rolling basis, that is, the revaluation of individual rating authorities in a planned sequential manner. The whole country is to be revalued over a period of five years and there will be subsequent revaluations at regular intervals thereafter.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the continued use of net annual value as the basis of valuation and a return to the use of full NAV and the continued exemption from rates of a wide range of properties currently exempt for rates. Such properties include domestic property, agricultural land and non-residential farm buildings, State occupied property, land developed for forestry, horticulture or sport, non-commercial and State funded hospitals and other treatment and care facilities, non-commercial and State funded educational undertakings such as national, vocational, and secondary schools, places of public worship, public parks, lighthouses and non-commercial graveyards, certain properties of a cultural nature, such as non-commercial art galleries, museums, libraries, national monuments and any legally designated national cultural institutions, property used for the advancement of pure science or literature <Col N="961" /> or the fine arts, property used by charitable organisations exclusively in a non-commercial manner for charitable purposes and property occupied by An Taisce. The Bill further provides for the continued exemption of bed and breakfast accommodation and self-catering accommodation from the rating system.</P>
    <P>The main changes proposed in the rates base are the rating of the administrative offices of health boards and Teagasc, the full rating of all harbours, except those in State occupation, confirming the rateability of VEC offices and the rating of those non-commercial State-sponsored bodies and agencies not already paying rates, such as An Bord Pleanála; the current fixed term relief from rates for the mining and land based petroleum extraction industries is being abolished, an exemption from rates for property used to breed and rear fish is being applied, the extension of the current exempt status enjoyed by most schools on the basis that they are not established or conducted for profit and/or are State funded, to those universities or other third level institutions on the same basis, which are not already exempted from rates, repealing the existing arrangements for valuing Irish Rail and allowing for the option of globally valuing that organisation.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the streamlining of the valuation process and providing ratepayers with a formal opportunity to be heard in the process of determining rateable valuations, enhanced powers for the Valuation Office to obtain information relevant to the valuation process and to obtain access to property for valuation purposes, the continued use and updating of existing valuation lists until such time as new valuation lists are made available from the initial revaluation proposed in the Bill and giving the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the power to specify the maximum rates income for local authorities in the first year in which a revaluation is effective for rating purposes. I have indicated that the consumer price index is the guide in this regard. In addition, the Bill re-enacts various provisions relating to the Commissioner of Valuation and the valuation tribunal.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been in gestation for a number of years. An interdepartmental review of the rateable valuation system was undertaken by the Department of Finance, the then Department of the Environment and the Valuation Office in 1995. This review was prompted by the need to carry out a thorough study of the valuation system and to consider options for improving it before any work commenced on comprehensive valuation legislation. The findings and the recommendations of the review group have significantly influenced the drawing up of the Valuation Bill.</P>
    <P>Existing valuation legislation provides for the valuation of all fixed property, including land and buildings. Also valued is incorporeal property, defined as property with no physical existence, such as tolls, easements, fishery rights and other rights over property. The Valuation Office has <Col N="962" /> responsibility for the rating valuation system. Although rates are no longer collected on domestic property as a result of the provisions of the 1978 Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, or on agricultural land as a consequence of a 1984 Supreme Court decision, nevertheless, both categories of property are still included in the valuation lists. At this point the commercial and industrial sector effectively constitutes the rateable valuation base.</P>
    <P>The basis of assessment for valuation purposes is the net annual value of a property. The NAV of a property is equivalent to the annual rent, exclusive of all payments in respect of rates, taxes, repairs and insurance which a property could reasonably be expected to command. The unit of assessment is the rateable hereditament, a hereditament being a property capable of inheritance. The rateable occupier, the person who has to pay the rates, is the person in the immediate use and enjoyment of the property, that is, the tenant or the owner in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Both rating authorities and ratepayers have the option of having a property listed for revision. As no national revaluation has been carried out in the last century and a half, this revision process is effectively the only way in which the valuation lists were changed in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendation made by the interdepartmental review group was that a revaluation of all rateable property should be undertaken. The primary objectives of such a revaluation are to remove anomalies in the valuation lists, to establish a uniform and equitable valuation base and to lessen the risk of any eventual challenge to the valuation system. Anomalies are widespread in the valuation lists. This is principally because no national revaluation has been carried out since the national valuation of all property in Ireland undertaken between 1852 and 1865. The rateable valuation of a property had been intended to be equivalent to its NAV but, over time, the rateable valuation increasingly represented a smaller and smaller fraction of the NAV.</P>
    <P>It is important to update the valuation lists to eliminate any anomalies as they form the base on which a substantial part of locally raised revenue for local government is levied. This will be done through a national revaluation based on the new legislation. The proposed revaluation, the first general revaluation since the middle of the 19th century, will be a significant undertaking. Accordingly, the Bill provides that the revaluation be carried out on a rolling basis. This means that each rating authority will be separately revalued as part of a planned sequential revaluation of the whole country. The sequence will depend on the Commissioner of Valuation's judgment as to which rating authorities are most in need of a revaluation. Each rating authority will have its own base date by reference to which valuations will be determined. Uniformity between valuations will be established on a rating authority basis, whereby all valuations in a rating <Col N="963" /> district will be uniform relative to one another instead of having a national uniformity, that is, where all valuations in the State would be required to be uniform with one another. Between revaluations, uniformity will be maintained on a rating authority basis. Such rating authority uniformity will be easier to establish and maintain than a national uniformity, thus making it easier to ensure ratepayers will be treated equitably. It is estimated that the revaluation will be completed in about five years and will be more easily and safely managed under the approach of a rolling revaluation which was also favoured by the interdepartmental review group. Under this approach, the Commissioner of Valuation will have the power to make an order for the revaluation of a particular rating authority. The base date, by reference to which valuations will be determined, will be designated in the commissioner's order and will be specific to that rating authority.</P>
    <P>A revaluation will impact on ratepayers in two ways. First, the rateable valuation base is likely to be redistributed within the rating area, with some ratepayers' bills increasing and some ratepayers' bills decreasing. Second, the rateable valuation of a ratepayer's property will no longer be expressed in terms of a fraction of the property's net annual value, but in terms of the property's full net annual value.</P>
    <P>A revaluation by itself will not increase the overall rates take by a rating authority. The rates take will be determined by the rate in the pound struck by the rating authority after a revaluation. A cap will be placed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the increase in rates income allowed in the first year in which the revaluation takes effect. However, a revaluation will lead to a redistribution of the rates burden between ratepayers, reflecting changes in the property market that have taken place over the years. The different rates of increase in rental levels between different categories of property and between different locations in a rating authority will have an impact on the outcome of the revaluation. The proportion of rateable properties in a rating authority represented by the different categories of rateable property, such as retail or industrial property or office accommodation, will also affect the outcome of a revaluation. Because of the multiplicity of relevant factors involved, the precise effect of a revaluation on individual ratepayers' rates bills cannot be indicated before the revaluation has been completed.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, rateable valuations will be expressed in terms of full net annual value, with effect from the first revaluation, instead of the current practice of using fractions of NAV. A return to full NAV was recommended by the interdepartmental review group as a means of improving the ease of comprehension and transparency of the valuation system and as the most appropriate basis of valuation for commercial and <Col N="964" /> industrial property. The concept of NAV has been used since the inception of the valuation system in both Ireland and Great Britain. When the valuation system was reformed in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, NAV was retained as the basis of valuation. The continued use of annual values have several advantages: both ratepayers and valuation practitioners are familiar with the concept and use of NAV in determining rateable valuations; the concept and use of NAV are familiar also to the courts; there is a lot of readily available evidence on which NAV can be based; and annual values are generally sufficiently stable to provide a predictable and reliable revenue base for rating authorities.</P>
    <P>It is considered that a return to using full NAV may cause the level of rateable valuations to increase on average by the order of 300 fold. However, the increase on individual properties will vary considerably. To take an example for illustrative purposes, a property with a rateable valuation of £100 under the present arrangements could have a rateable valuation in the region of £30,000 when full NAV is used. Consequently, the rate in the pound charged by local authorities will have to fall sharply in order that the total rates collected through the rating system will remain broadly the same. Effectively, the rate in the pound will be reduced sufficiently to offset the increase in rateable valuation and hence deliver a revenue neutral outcome, subject to some adjustment for inflation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which is primarily aimed towards modernising the valuation process, mainly retains the current effective rateable valuation base. I have already set out those types of properties which will continue to be subject to rates, that is, mainly commercial and industrial properties. I have also indicated those properties which will not be subject to rates. In addition, I have outlined the changes being made in the rates base under the Bill. I would, however, like to made some further comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>Under the existing valuation code those harbours which have been established as commercial bodies under the Harbours Act, 1996, are deemed to be rateable. The harbours concerned are, however, appealing the rateable valuations and do not consider that they should be included in the list of rateable properties. Consequently, to dispel any doubt about this issue, the Bill confirms their rateability and removes the anomaly whereby Dublin Port is liable for rates on only 21% of its rateable valuation. Prior to the 1996 Harbours Act, only Greenore and Rosslare ports were fully rateable. The Bill will ensure that all commercial ports in the State are treated in a similar manner and, on equitable grounds, the case for their exclusion from the rates base is not sustainable. Under the Bill those harbours operated by harbour authorities, excluding those harbours still in State occupation, will also be liable to rates.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the exemption status currently enjoyed by most schools be extended to <Col N="965" /> those universities and other third level educational institutions not established or conducted for profit and-or State funded which are not already relieved of the obligation to pay rates. The principal beneficiaries will be Trinity College and UCD, which are currently partly rated. Private agricultural colleges may benefit in so far as they meet the exemption criteria. Other possible beneficiaries are the Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians and the Incorporated Society of the King's Inns. The extent to which these institutions will benefit is dependent on whether they can show they are not established or conducted for a private profit and are conducted for educational purposes.</P>
    <P>The Bill removes the anomaly whereby mines become rateable only seven years after they have been opened and reopened mines become rateable seven years after they have been reopened. This seven year relief from rates was conceded in the 19th century when mining technology was less advanced than it is today and it might have taken several years to bring a mine into full production after it was opened. The Bill also removes the anomaly whereby the right to drill for and take away petroleum is not deemed a rateable hereditament in relation to a particular oil pool until the expiration of 20 years from the date on which petrol was first produced from that oil pool. Any mine, reopened mine or petroleum extraction operation already enjoying a relief from rates at the time the new valuation Act commences will continue to benefit from the balance of the respective relief. That is only fair.</P>
    <P>All commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies are liable for rates under the existing valuation code, with the exception of Teagasc and An Bord Pleanála. These two bodies are currently exempted on the grounds that they exist for public purposes. To have all commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies treated consistently, the Bill provides for the inclusion of both bodies and other State-sponsored bodies in the rates base. As regards Teagasc, it is proposed to exclude from rates all property that is used for educational purposes and non-commercial agricultural research. Similarly, property in use by FÁS for industrial training and property in use for industrial research by Forbairt will continue to be excluded from the rates base.</P>
    <P>All property operated by local authorities and occupied by the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards is liable for rates under existing legislation and it is not proposed to alter this position. Prior to a judgment of the Valuation Tribunal in 1989, all administrative offices of health boards were deemed to be rateable in the same manner as local authority property. The Bill returns them to that position. Some of the administrative offices of the vocational education committees are also exempt from rates on the grounds that they are used for public purposes. However, rates are collected in respect of other VEC administrative offices. The Bill contains provisions which will confirm the rateability of these administrative <Col N="966" /> offices. The administrative elements of schools will be unaffected by these provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the continued exemption from rates for An Taisce by providing an exemption from rates for property occupied by a body established to conserve Ireland's natural and built endowments when the property is used exclusively in a non-commercial manner to meet that objective.</P>
    <P>Given the continuing relief being provided for farm buildings, the Bill provides for similar relief from rates to facilities used for the breeding and rearing of fish. Fish farms are currently rateable. The exemption will cover facilities directly related to the operation of the fish farm but facilities used for the processing, storage and retailing of fish products will, of course, continue to be rateable.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that State-occupied property will continue to be exempt from rates &ndash; that is Government offices, Garda stations, Army barracks, prisons, State-occupied harbours and canals occupied by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The commercial sector, in particular IBEC and the Dublin Regional Business Alliance, have made representations that State-occupied property should be made subject to rates. While having some sympathy for their viewpoint, I would point out that rates have never been levied on property occupied by the State but that a contribution<i> in lieu </i>of rates was paid to local authorities from the 1870s until 1987. Since 1999, the contribution has been subsumed into the rates support grant, now the local government fund.</P>
    <P>Making State-occupied property subject to rates would have to be on the basis of clawback measures from the local government fund being put in place to compensate for the significant rates income that certain local authorities would derive from State-occupied property. It must also be recognised that the local government fund has increased considerably in recent years. Rating State-occupied property with clawback measures from the fund being put in place, would almost certainly result in no reduction in the rates paid by current ratepayers. I simply was not going to enter into this cycle. I did not see any purpose in doing so and, in the final analysis, there would not be any real benefit.</P>
    <P>While exempting State-occupied property from rates, the Valuation Bill does, however, provide for the commissioner of valuation to value these properties in the first revaluation following enactment. This will allow for rates to be collected in respect of these properties should Government decide at a later date to pursue that course of action. The State should have a knowledge of the rateable base of all the property it owns and, thus, of what the rateable income of all its property throughout the country could be. The Bill will provide for that.</P>
    <P>Bed &amp; Breakfast accommodation and self-catering accommodation have not been liable to rates since the Local Government (Financial <Col N="967" /> Provisions) Act, 1978, took effect. In preparing the Valuation Bill, the Government considered this issue at length but decided not to rate B&amp;B and self-catering accommodation. While there might be merit on equity grounds in the proposals to rate B&amp;B and self catering accommodations, it is also clear that there are currently significant practical difficulties in doing so, in particular, the absence of a compulsory national licensing or registration system for such premises.</P>

      <P>The 1988 Valuation Act provided for the option of assessing public utilities within the framework of a global valuation. In essence, a global valuation involves a simultaneous nationwide valuation of a public utility's total property, as opposed to the separate valuation at different times of a public utility's individual properties. In the Bill, the global valuation provisions have been retained essentially unchanged. However, the prescribed method of valuation currently applicable to all global valuations has been removed. Public utility undertakings assessed under the global valuation provisions will be valued on the same basis as all other property, that is on the basis of NAV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> It is the Government's intention that the effect of this legislation should be broadly neutral in its impact on the Exchequer. This intention will be taken into account in the calculation of grants and payments to bodies in receipt of State grants.</P>
    <P>It is intended that after the completion of the first national revaluation, subsequent revaluations of rating authorities will be carried out at regular intervals to ensure the valuation base is kept up to date. Accordingly, the Bill has a provision which requires the commissioner to commence a revaluation of a rating authority no earlier than five years and no later than ten years after the previous revaluation of that authority commenced. That is an important issue, so that we do not end up after 150 years having to do what we are doing now. It should be done on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals existing valuation legislation. Accordingly, it provides for the continued use and updating of the existing valuation lists until new valuation lists are available. In effect, the existing valuation list for a rating authority will continue to be updated by the commissioner and used for rating purposes until that rating authority has been completely revalued.</P>
    <P>The current valuation system has a revision process, whereby ratepayers and rating authorities can apply for the revision of the valuation lists to take account of any change in circumstances of a property. Such a change in circumstances would include a change in use, an extension or contraction of a property, and any other factor that might have relevance for its rateable valuation or for its rateable status. Revision applications generally seek a revision of the rateable valuation of a property. The Bill provides that a revision process will be retained in the new valuation system. A revision process will still be necessary to take account of any change in the circumstances of an individual property that occurs between revaluations. It would obviously be unfair to a ratepayer to have to wait until a revaluation takes account of any change in the circumstances of a property, and any lower rates bill that would result from a consequently lower rateable valuation. Similarly, a rating authority should be able to charge rates on any increased value of a property and on a new property without having to wait until a revaluation.</P>
    <P>Under the current valuation system, a ratepayer or a rating authority can appeal a determination by the Valuation Office, firstly, to the Commissioner of Valuation and, secondly, if dissatisfied with the commissioner's determination, to the Valuation Tribunal. Both of these appeal provisions are being retained, as is the option of an appeal to the High Court or Supreme Court on a point of law. However, the Bill augments the formal appeal process with an earlier phase, called the consultative phase, during which the ratepayer will be notified of the Valuation Office's proposed determination before it becomes effective for rating purposes, and will be given an opportunity to make a submission to the <Col N="969" /> Valuation Office, if they so wish, about that determination. The ratepayer will have 28 days within which to make such a submission to the Valuation Office before the valuation certificate is issued and the valuation list amended or published. This is an important aspect of the Bill, putting the ratepayer back in a very strong and central position.</P>
    <P>The time period for appeal to the commissioner against a valuation certificate issued by the Valuation Office is also being increased from the current position of 28 days to 40 days. The time limits for appeals to the Valuation Tribunal at 28 days, and to the High Court at 21 days, remain unchanged. Therefore, under the Bill the time period from when the ratepayer becomes aware that a revaluation-revision is being undertaken to the date by which he or she has to appeal to the commissioner, will be considerably increased compared with the present position.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that an individual applying for a revision or appealing a Valuation Office's decision, will now apply directly to the commissioner on the matter, rather than going through the relevant local authority as a present. Appeals to the Valuation Tribunal will continue to be made directly to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give the Valuation Office enhanced powers to obtain information relevant to the determination of rateable valuations. In most cases, information requested by the Valuation Office is supplied voluntarily. However, in a small number of cases, the Valuation Office has difficulty obtaining relevant information. Accordingly, the Bill provides that, as a general requirement, all occupiers of rateable property will be obliged to submit to the Commissioner of Valuation, and update whenever necessary, such information as is required for the purposes of valuation. The commissioner will also be enabled to require the provision of information from an occupier about a specific property. Such information will include details concerning tenure, terms of a lease, purchase price, contract date, amounts of expenditure, rents and premiums payable, landlords' contributions, including any contribution towards fit out costs, tenants' improvements and whatever other details the commissioner specifies. Failure to comply with these obligations will be penalised by fines of up to £1,500 depending on the offence.</P>
    <P>The Bill also retains the right of access to all property for the provision of valuation. Failure to comply with this obligation would also be penalised by a fine of up to £1,500. In circumstances where it is seeking entry on to a property, the Valuation Office will have to give three days notice before exercising its right of access, an important provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the first comprehensive valuation legislation introduced since the 1850s. It is designed to improve, streamline and modernise the operation of the valuation system, to remove deficiencies that have built up over the years, to bring it more into line with the contemporary <Col N="970" /> commercial environment and to make the system more transparent and equitable for the ratepayer. It will allow a revaluation of the country to take place, the first since the middle of the 19th century. Such a revaluation will allow a uniform and equitable valuation base to be established and anomalies to be removed. It will also allow a return to full net annual values. Provision is also made for regular revaluations every five to ten years to prevent the system ever becoming so out of date again. The Bill enhances the appeal process and provides the opportunity for ratepayers to be involved in the valuation process from an early stage. I stress that the Bill is not designed to increase the rates income of local authorities and, therefore, provides for a cap on the overall rates income in the year in which the revaluation takes effect. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Creed. I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this Bill, which is welcome. To say it is long overdue would be an understatement given that it is replacing statutes dating back as far as 1838.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the personnel in the Valuation Office. They are people of very high integrity and are very courteous in their dealings with the public and public representatives. It is probably one of the busiest public offices in the country and the volume of work it does is tremendous.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a lost opportunity. In 1977, the rates issue became a topic of conversation and action. The abolition of domestic rates was the first step in eliminating them. It was widely welcomed because of the inequities within the system. When it came to the question of agricultural land, the rateable valuations were very much at variance with each other and there was no coherent plan or any consistency. The Supreme Court judgment of the 1980s indicated that this could not continue to be a basis on which local taxes were raised for local authorities.</P>
      <P>Is it a realistic basis for the collection of revenue for local authorities from commercial and industrial premises? Various people, particularly small business people, have said that commercial rates are a bottomless pit to shore up the overruns of local authorities. It is a damning indictment if one considers the way in which the small business association has referred to rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he has capped the rates. For the year he mentioned, at 5%, that is welcome. However, if we take this year alone, when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government said there would be a cap at 9%, most local authorities went up to the limit. Most businesses and industries are paying rates at 9%, way above the anticipated inflation rate. Although the Minister has given an undertaking to cap the rates, no long-term guarantee can be given. That is fine given the times in which we are living, because we are getting huge resources and finances from the EU, but come the day when there is a reduction in the finances available to local authorities, the focus will come back to the very lim<Col N="971" /> ited number of ratepayers. Some people might say the number of ratepayers is decreasing. Although the Valuation Office originally had to assess 1.7 million households and buildings for valuation, under this Bill the number will be reduced to around 160,000. That is a huge task for any office to undertake.</P>
    <P>There is a vagueness in the Bill. I understand the difficulties which this task will present for the people in the Valuation Office. Do we have adequate staffing and resources within the Valuation Office to carry out this revaluation? There is no indication that additional resources and personnel will be available to the office to undertake this task. In terms of the time scale, we are talking about a minimum of five years. There is no definite date by which we have to complete this. That is a very serious shortcoming in the Bill. At present we have an ongoing revaluation process, which is cumbersome. I very much welcome the elimination of the local authority and that one will go directly to the Valuation Office for revaluation. That will eliminate a time factor which existed and it is welcome in so far as it is a more direct route.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the idea of consultation between the ratepayer and the commissioner in the Valuation Office. However, the Bill is really nothing more than a tidying up exercise. If there was a reassessment of certain aspects of the valuation process, it would be important to state them. They are not, however, stated. We are only nibbling at the edges or tidying up irregularities and inconsistencies that have occurred and have become blatantly obvious to everyone involved in the process of valuation.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at how valuations come about initially. It is a hit and miss operation at present. Many properties have not been revalued because they have been missed. This is an opportunity to revalue properties, which I welcome. Were it not for the planning process and planning applications at local authority level where the local rate collector or revenue collector for the local authority is able to assess a property, pinpoint reconstruction or extensions or new buildings of a commercial or industrial nature, there would be no process of ongoing revaluation unless a person come forward. Ratepayers are reluctant to come forward for revaluation because it inevitably means an increase.</P>
    <P>Who will go out there in this day and age and self-inflict an increase in taxation? It is nothing but an increase in taxation for them. It is a double taxation and is one of a multiplicity of taxes which businesses have to pay. There is a great fear among small business people and industries regarding what is about to take place. It is inevitable there will be increases. For the life of me I cannot see how any property will be revalued downwards. That is a terrible situation facing most people today. The result of this Bill will mean additional local tax and it cannot be viewed in any other way. We are now providing the <Col N="972" /> opportunity for local authorities to revalue upwards, to have a greater income and on top of that we will allow them a cap of 5 per cent and thereafter it will be at the behest of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to cap it. Based on this year's scene we are talking of a cap of 9 per cent. Few businesses can continue. It is fine while the buoyancy of the Celtic tiger continues but what will happen when the slide comes and there is pressure? There was a process in the past where the local county manager could waive rates because certain industries or commercial enterprises were experiencing serious financial hardship and there was a threat of redundancies at a time when jobs were scarce in certain areas. Obviously, that will now be eliminated. I cannot see any provision in the Bill for a waiver but if it is there I would like to know how it will operate. Under the provisions of this Bill the ratepayer will deal directly with the Valuation Office rather than through the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a list of buildings which will be derated outside the rating process. Despite the fact that he replied to Deputy Creed that he had no consultation with the Independents who shore up this Government, the reality is that the party went down the road of introducing rates on bed and breakfast accommodation and suddenly it was gone. The assurance the Minister has given today must frighten many bed and breakfast operations throughout the country. The reason I say that is that he has no clear definition of what is a bed and breakfast operation. Until he has a clear definition and follows it up by saying this cannot be done until a licensing process is put in place, there will be a real fear among bed and breakfasts operations, rural and urban, throughout the country. If one is licensed one is operating as a commercial enterprise and therefore one is liable for commercial rates in the same way as any other business. I ask the Minister to be clear and unequivocal in his commitment that bed and breakfast operations as we know them in rural Ireland, where tourism is important to support incomes and to maintain people on farms, will not have rates imposed on them. Irrespective of what pressure may come from the Deputy from Kerry and others, will the Minister yield to him as he has done in other areas such as the dual mandate? The Minister was on the point of quivering in that instant and I think he will do likewise in this instance also.</P>
    <P>I wish to hand over to Deputy Creed. This legislation will have to be made more definite on Committee Stage. Will the whole country be revalued over a period or will it be local authority by local authority. If that is the road we are to go there will be advantages and disadvantages. There will be winners and losers and the losers will be those who will have to pay increased rates as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard most of the Minister's speech and I was broadly impressed with its con<Col N="973" /> tents and the contents of the Bill. As my colleague, Deputy Burke, has said, basing our rateable valuation system on legislation based on the 1800s is of itself sufficient grounds to revisit this area. Broadly what is contained in the Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>One of the earliest political events that I can recall was the 1977 general election. I can remember it specifically in the context of a great friend of mine, now deceased, who was involved in a local GAA club, Pádraig Dervan, a native Galway man. I remember being dismayed to find in the back of his car the Fianna Fáil manifesto &ndash; he used to transport us to matches. If my memory serves me right, the slogan was &ldquo;Let's get the country moving again&rdquo;. The broad thrust of that manifesto was the abolition of rates and car tax. It was a give away manifesto which, by and large, the people opted for in great numbers. One might ask what relevance that has to the valuation debate. Following on from that were the great tax marches of the late 1970s and the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>At this juncture it would be wise to reflect on the narrow base for revenue raising activities. By and large, it is income tax driven and there are some associated taxes, commercial rates being one. The collection system has been narrowed very significantly. The 1977 manifesto was the trigger mechanism and the subsequent election results and the obligation to implement those promises led inevitably to the tax marches of the late 1970s and the early 1980s. If my memory serves me right, the Commission on Taxation, which Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien headed, subsequently looked into all those issues. It strongly recommended that the tax base be broadened to shift the onus of responsibility from PAYE workers in general.</P>
      <P>It is a pleasant time to revisit this debate because in the climate of a successful economy income tax rates have been falling and to an extent PAYE workers are less burdened than in the past. It is possible to revisit it now not in the sense of broadening the tax base, from the point of view of increasing the revenue we take, but so that we can further reduce the liability which the PAYE sector faces. That is a debate we should not lose sight of. The tax base is excessively narrow. Primarily it is an income tax based system. There is scope in this climate to look at further sources of revenue not to increase the take but to make it a more equitable system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us are aware &ndash; and it will not be improved in the context of this Bill &ndash; there are huge residential property portfolios being held by individuals which are not liable for rates. People who had cash bought numerous houses. There are people who have ten, 15 or 20 houses rented out in the private sector but they are not registered with their local authority as landlords. Effectively, these people are non-existent in terms of their obligation to pay rates. Perhaps the Minister of State will say if they complied with the letter of the law such would not be the case, but that is the reality. There are enormous residential prop<Col N="974" /> erty portfolios held by individuals who do not have rateable valuations. Wearing my local authority hat, I can say that some people feel very aggrieved at the manner in which they are treated by the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday, a man who owns a truck and has a permanent contract with Cement Roadstone visited my constituency clinic. This man has gone through the valuation process but, because he takes his truck home and parks it in a garage adjacent to his house, he was found liable for rates. The logical extension of this is that a travelling salesman who brings his car home in the evening or a hackney driver or taxi driver should have the garage adjacent to his house equally rated. This is crazy and there are huge anomalies in the rateable valuation system which need to be addressed. Broadening the tax base is an associated matter which we should not lose sight of and such a debate would provide an opportunity to raise that issue.</P>
    <P>I concur with the views expressed by Deputy Healy-Rae in relation to exempting bed and breakfast establishments from rates. However, there is a definition issue here. Deputy Healy-Rae is broadly campaigning on the rural based, by and large non-registered residential properties where one or two rooms are used for that purpose. However, there are purpose-built 20 and 30 bedroom facilities trading as B&amp;Bs but which are not liable for rates. There needs to be more clarity in relation to what is or is not exempt, otherwise the commercial viability of hotel properties which are liable for rates will be undermined. Unfair competition between B&amp;Bs and hotels is a glaring manifestation in that context but small garages, panel beaters and other businesses which are not rated are present put their competitors at an unfair disadvantage. Perhaps there should be some type of amnesty for declaring commercial operations and, rather than just looking at the tax returns of businesses, their rateable valuations and so on should be looked at. This would allow for a more level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>In relation to the valuation process over five years, it would be more equitable if the findings of the revaluation process were not implemented until revaluation is completed nationally. If the implementation of the process is carried out on a piecemeal basis, it will discriminate unfairly against others. I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister of State will take on board my points on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that I had a briefing from the Minister of State's officials, for which I am grateful. This was very useful in going through what is, by and large, a technical Bill. I intend to be very concise in what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is welcome. We have long since needed a complete review of valuations nation wide and I am pleased this will take place over the next few years. I am particularly pleased that under the provisions in the Bill it will be obligatory to carry out a further review within a five to <Col N="975" /> ten year period. This will ensure we will not again get ourselves into the current position in the near future or at any stage.</P>
    <P>I will make a few net political points, one of which relates to State property. In a sense I am wearing two hats here because I am a member of Dublin Corporation in whose area a great deal of State property is located. Clearly, if the Government's programme of decentralisation continues as is intended, this will also apply to many other local authorities. There is no doubt that Dublin Corporation wants to have State property rated simply in order to increase the rate base and the income flow to the corporation. The Minister of State pointed out that he believes it would be necessary to claw it back through the local government fund. That would be a political decision. However, it would be possible to make a different political decision. I urge him to do this because, given the way in which it currently operates, Dublin Corporation, which has a budget this year of almost £4 million, effectively has no discretion as to how it raises the money. That is a crazy situation. If the biggest local authority in terms of the rate base and the amount of money it spends has no discretion, it makes a nonsense of any notion of local government autonomy in terms of revenue-raising and how the money is spent.</P>
    <P>There is a problem about rates as such in so far as it is not terribly clear what exactly this means. It is a charge for services or is it a tax? In truth, it is both. This leads to other difficulties when assessing for rates purposes sporting clubs, community centres, community facilities and child care facilities. While some facilities clearly operate for profit and others are commercial operations in that sense of the word, others are a much greyer area. I am referring to community facilities or community centres where money is raised to keep that facility in operation within the community and is of clear net benefit to a community. For example, in relation to sports clubs, sports fields are not rated but other sports facilities, including stands, dressing rooms and club facilities are. In many cases, it is a considerable burden on clubs to pay the rates. Paradoxically, in some cases, they receive grants from Government, the National Lottery or the local authorities which, in turn, partly go to pay the rates, which is one of their significant impositions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke made the point earlier that it is important that the Valuation Office has the resources to carry out this ongoing review, not just the review that will immediately follow the passage of the Bill, but the review that will become obligatory in the future. Perhaps the Minister of State will address this issue when responding.</P>
    <P>I apologise for making this point as a Dubliner but I think it also applies to the Minister of State's city, Waterford. This relates to the assessment of needs and the way in which the local government fund has operated to the detriment <Col N="976" /> of urban authorities. The way in which the assessment is made and the criteria for deciding the payments made under the local government fund to local authorities has militated against the urban authorities. In the short time since the fund came into operation, none of them managed to get the sort of top-up facility which has been made available to other county councils throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I must be blunt and say that my party wishes to facilitate the rest of the business of the House today, particularly the Local Government Bill. With due deference to the Minister and to the importance of the Bill and his officials, I will retain the remainder of what I have to say until Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on the Valuation Bill, 2000 which has been introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen. The Bill has been in the pipeline for many years and for good reason. The rateable system has been in operation for hundreds of years and it is important to ensure the integrity of the system. Given that many changes have been introduced by various Governments and courts over the years, it is important that the integrity of the system is updated so that we can all stand over it.</P>
      <P>The question is often asked as to what are rates. Is it a charge for services provided by local authorities or is it a tax? I believe rates are essentially a property tax. There is nothing wrong with that because this has been the case from time immemorial. The number of properties subject to this tax has decreased dramatically in recent years for a variety of reasons. It is a tax payable by all property holders in a local authority area and goes towards financing local authorities. This Bill is not about increasing the rates base for any local authority or the rates burden on the business and commercial community. It is to ensure greater equity and that the rates base in a county is more evenly spread, based on the valuations of the businesses in the area. There will be greater transparency regarding the way in which the new mechanisms will work. It must be reiterated that this is not a trick to try to get more money from existing ratepayers. As a member of Laois County Council for the past year and a half, I am familiar with proposing and seconding the estimates on an annual basis. The increase in rates is always a topic for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 the Department of the Environment issued a major report on the financing of local government in Ireland. It was produced by KPMG in association with Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, and Murphy, Ryan &amp; Associates Limited. It is a substantial document covering many activities in local government. There is much in the report about the rates base and the importance of rates to local authorities. It is important to stress that this has diminished in both real and proportional terms in the funding of local authorities. In 1938, the rates payable in local authorities contributed 50% to the total cost <Col N="977" /> of running local authorities. In 1948, the figure was reduced to 41%, in 1958 it was reduced to 40%, in 1968 it was 32%, in 1970 it was 32% and in 1983 it was 12%, thanks to the policy of Fianna Fáil when it abolished the need for householders to pay rates. That impacted on local authorities but the balance of the money was made up by the Department of the Environment through the rates support grant and there was no loss of funding. In 1995, rates as a percentage of total local government expenditure was 26%. This was probably due to increased business activity and revaluations. The percentage of rates collected in Laois has increased.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which I have discussed with the departmental officials who have been very helpful to me. It concerns not only Laois but every other local authority. Laois County Council will have £3,342,607 in rates in the current year which represents 13% of the council's total income for the year but it is not in line with the national average which is much higher. Laois, not having a high industrial base and having many Government offices, prisons, hospitals and other bodies that do not pay rates directly to the local authority, gets less in rates than most other authorities. Last year Laois County Council increased the rates that will be payable to the local authority by £383,000. That was made up of two elements, a 9% increase in the rate in the pound &ndash; the maximum permitted by the Department &ndash; which yielded £266,000 which was 70% of the increase and an increase in the net effective valuation in County Laois from £74,585 in 2000 to £77,305 in 2001. That was due to revaluations and new businesses getting off the ground resulting in an increase of 4% in the net effective valuation, and that translated into an increase of £117,000 additional funding for Laois County Council.</P>
    <P>Of the increase in rates payable in our county in 2001 as against the year 2000, 70% was directly attributable to the 9% increase permitted by the Department but 30% was due to buoyancy. It is important that when we have a buoyant economy and there is a normal increase in the net effective valuation in a county that the county continues to get the benefit of that. In the transition arrangements that will come into place before the new measures are introduced, it is important that no county is left short. Local authorities should look at their valuations between now and when the legislation comes into effect. They will have a number of years in which to ensure that when the uniform system of rates is introduced in any local authority it will be on a proper basis. It has been said that in year one of the transition period the only increase that will be allowed in the rates in the county in that year, according to the legislation, will be in line with inflation. That would eliminate a buoyancy bonus, so to speak, in that year. I know it is only for one year but it would be at that lower base figure forever thereafter and only the inflation or other increases that would occur in the normal course of events would apply. It is essential for county managers to ensure their <Col N="978" /> valuations are in order prior to their county being involved in this new valuation procedure. If additional finance is needed to ensure these valuations are taken up it must be provided by Government, otherwise local authorities will be penalised by not allowing them to have the correct valuation.</P>
    <P>Rates are a property tax. Practically all properties are included. As a result of various court cases over the years, agricultural rates have been struck down as they were unfair. We must ensure that does not happen in the case of the commercial and industrial rates base and that we have proper valuation legislation in place. In the 1997 general election manifesto, Fianna Fáil promised to abolish domestic rates on all households. That took many ratepayers out of the net. The funding that would have been lost to the local authorities was made up in full by the Department. The report produced by KPMG made the point that domestic rates are still on the valuation list. The only issue is they are not paid by the domestic householder but directly by central Government to the local authorities. That is a subtle point but it is one made in the report.</P>
    <P>Certain properties are exempted, such as State offices and so on. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position regarding community facilities, whether it be the local GAA or soccer pitch, dressing rooms, community halls and so on. I know that water rates are levied on some community halls and that some of them have a waiver. Will the Minister clarify if rates are payable on community halls and, if so, have local authorities the facility to waive them?</P>
    <P>We say that the rates base is, in effect, the commercial and industrial base but that is not quite so. Dressing rooms at GAA pitches and such like are included under the rates base although they are not commercial activities. Most of the constituency offices based in Deputies' constituencies receive rates demand notes, which are paid like all others, although we are not in business in the commercial sector. It is clear from this that a number of buildings are rightly caught in the rates net. It is not confined to organisations involved in commercial and industrial activities.</P>
    <P>The question of the net annual valuation is a well established concept in the court. It will be the basis of valuations from here on. It amounts to 5% of the aggregate replacement cost of the property less the appropriate amount of depreciation. The appropriation valuation for plant, machinery, pipe lines, power lines and other items is also included. It is a realistic, simple approach and, most importantly, it allows for the fact that the replacement or reinstatement cost of a building in, say, Dublin city centre is far higher than in the middle of County Laois. It is good that a uniform valuation is not used because in the absence of this construction and replacement, costs in rural areas, which are cheaper than in urban areas, would be allocated a higher notional valuation.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure there is uniformity within each local authority. It will ensure nobody <Col N="979" /> can complain they are paying an unfair burden in term of rates by comparison with another business on the street or in another town. This concept will remove anomalies from the system and is to be welcomed on that basis. It is a new concept, but when it become fully operational within one, two or three years of the enactment of this legislation people will see the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>Some of the exemptions from rates have specific relevance to different parts of the country. It is important to recognise that at present property used for the following purposes are not included in the rates base: domestic, agricultural, State occupied, land development, forestry, horticulture and sport; non-commercial and State funded hospitals and other treatment centres; non-commercial and State funded educational undertakings, such as the national vocational and secondary schools; places of worship; public parks, libraries, national monuments and properties used for the advancement of the pure sciences and the fine arts; charitable organisations that are used in a non-commercial manner for charitable purposes; and property occupied by An Taisce.</P>
    <P>The concentration of Government buildings varies from county to county. County Laois is fortunate in having a high concentration of such buildings, be it hospitals or regional offices for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. In addition, between the old prison in Portlaoise and the new one recently opened, the biggest prison complex in the country is located in Portlaoise. This places an enormous strain on the local authority in terms of providing water, sewerage, roads and other infrastructure. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not provide commensurate payments in respect of rates. While there are major benefits to the county in having such a major facility, in terms of employment and to the local economy, the lack of rates payments on the buildings must be taken into account at local level.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that in the year it is introduced there will be no increase in the rates set by any local authority above the rate of inflation. There will have to be transitional arrangements between now and then to ensure that each local authority has a proper valuation of its property portfolio, otherwise they will lose out on the buoyancy effect that tends to arise in a booming economy. There is also a welcome change to the approach to valuation. The Valuation Office will issue a notice of its intention to value an office or a property and the property owner will have 28 days to make a submission, which must be taken into account. I understand this procedure is identical to that in operation at the Environmental Protection Agency. It issues a notification stating its intention to issue a determination in 28 days and any submission it receives in the interim must be taken into account. That is a welcome development as it may reduce the number of appeals. If people are unhappy they can continue to appeal to the Com<Col N="980" /> missioner of Valuation, thence to the Valuation Tribunal and if a point of law arises very citizen has the right to appeal to the courts. There have been many High Court cases on valuations and there was much case law on which to draw when finalising this legislation.</P>
    <P>I understand the number of appeals to the Valuation Tribunal have decreased recently, which is to be welcomed. Perhaps it is because in the booming economy businesses may not be so preoccupied with the increases or revaluations of the rates in respect of their properties. In recessionary times people may be much more watchful of increases in the rateable valuation and may be more inclined to appeal.</P>
    <P>There are many quarries and mines in Laoighis-Offaly, be they sand pits, gravel pits, various types of stone quarries and so on. This is an extractive industry, but such enterprises have been too heavily penalised over many years. I know there have been cases in the courts, and there are clear formulae and that there have been cases in London, in the House of Lords, and everywhere on this issue. However, that industry has been allocated an unfair burden of the rates bill wherever it operates.</P>
    <P>The rates payable on new toll roads, provided for under the national development plan, will be contentious. One will be located in County Laois, at the N7 and N8 junction south of Portlaoise. The payment of rates on that road will make land acquisitions from farmers even more difficult because they will not sell for normal road building purposes, but to the State, where the new roads will be a commercial activity and where people will derive incomes from the tolls charged. Rates will be payable, as per the precedent established in the courts regarding toll bridges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my opinion, which I have shared with the relevant Ministers and the National Roads Authorities. I will continue to express this view on behalf of my constituents. The land is not being acquired for normal road building purposes but for commercial activities. In view of this, those selling the land should get a commercial price. Some 200 farmers in County Laois will be directly affected by the N7 and N8 roadways. If the Waterford route is constructed it will be located on the west side of County Carlow and will pass through County Laois, which will be the county most heavily affected by the new national primary routes network.</P>
      <P>No rates are payable by public hospitals, despite the fact that private consultants conduct much business in them. If they operated in private hospitals they would have to pay rates. I do not suggest public hospitals should pay rates, but there should be a mechanism to ensure that the State does not subvent the income of hospital consultants who use public hospitals for their private work. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to understand all the technical nuances of the Bill, nevertheless, I welcome it because, as the Minister of State said, a key motivation for introducing it is to allow for a revaluation of commercial and industrial properties in all rating authorities over a period of years.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned by the Minister's statement that the increase in local authority rates income through revaluation is not the purpose of the new legislation. He stated that in order to put this beyond doubt, provision is made for the capping of the increase in the overall rates income of a rating authority area in the year in which the first revaluation is issued for rating purposes. I note that revaluation of all rateable property throughout the country is to be carried out on a rolling basis, in other words, the revaluation of individual rating authorities will be carried out in a planned, sequential manner over a five year period and will be carried out at regular intervals thereafter.</P>
      <P>The exemptions from rates, including those which apply to State occupied property, are of concern. Dublin Corporation, in adopting its most recent estimate, established a value for money committee to investigate means through which additional income could be generated. I will advert to a number of these later.</P>
      <P>The Bill's objectives are clear. We are revising legislation introduced in the 19th century in order to facilitate the revaluation of all rateable property in the country, make the valuation system more transparent to ratepayers and rating authorities and clearly define categories of property as rateable and non-rateable. A number of the Bill's 13 Parts and six Schedules are worth noting. Part 4 provides for a definition of &ldquo;relevant property&rdquo; to be valued under this Act and outlines the categories of property which will and will not be rateable. Part 7 provides for an extensive appeals process. Part 11 provides for and defines the net added value of valuation and Part 12 provides that the revaluation process will result in overall rates increasing by a rate not greater than a specific percentage provided for inflation as measured by the consumer price index. Schedule 3 lists categories of relevant property to be subject to rates and Schedule 4 lists categories which are not to be rated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take on board the concerns of members of Dublin Corporation in regard to the Bill. The Bill will enable the Valuation Office to revalue all property in the State. It is proposed to carry out this revaluation on a phased basis and to implement the new valuations on a rolling basis, area by area. This process may create an imbalance between different areas of the country. If possible, revaluations should be carried out at the same time throughout the country in order to avoid possible distortions arising between different areas. I am sure such a pro<Col N="982" /> posal will drive civil servants and technical staff wild but, with access to modern information technology, it should at least be considered. Rating authorities would need to receive the final valuation list in August-September in order to achieve greater forward planning in the preparation of their annual estimates of expenses. It would be beneficial if valuation list publication dates were agreed between the Commissioner of Valuation and individual rating authorities. Perhaps the Minister would consider including a provision to this effect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main changes proposed in the rates base include a proposal to include the rating of administrative offices of health boards and Teagasc. The rateability of VEC offices and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies and agencies which do not pay rates at present, such as An Bord Pleanála, is also confirmed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Schedule 3 seeks to retain the exemption of State property from rates. There is an extensive portfolio of State property within Dublin Corporation's administrative area. The Bill proposes to value such property but to exempt it from rates. The request to the Minister to amend this provision is justifiable. Dublin Corporation is requesting rates to be levied on all State property. It is necessary to broaden the rates base as much as possible and this could be achieved by making State property liable to rates. The request will not come as any great surprise to the Minister or his officials. Such a change would probably be revenue neutral for local authorities as the State would probably insist on a commensurate adjustment in grant allocations from the local government fund. We would argue that the State is no longer exempted from the planning process and that Departments should prepare administrative budgets which reflect the full extent of administrative costs, one of which would be the cost of occupying property. Due to the State's extensive property portfolio within the corporation area, we are asking that rates be levied on such property.</P>
    <P>Section 3 states that, for the purpose of the Act, a property which provides lodgings should not, by this fact alone, be precluded from being defined as a domestic premises. This means that accommodation not registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts, namely, certain bed and breakfast establishments, will continue to be exempted from rates. The Minister should consider amending the Bill to make bed and breakfast establishments with six or more rooms available for guests liable for rates on that portion of the premises. This would not adversely affect smaller establishments. There is a number of very large bed and breakfast establishments which differ entirely to the type of establishments in the more traditional tourist areas throughout the country, such as the west, south-west and north-west. We believe there is very little difference between the guesthouse accommodation available in Dublin and that provided by hotels in the city.</P>

      <P>The other type of accommodation to which we wish to draw attention is investment property, such as apart-hotels, which clearly falls into the business category. The definition of domestic property should identify such property as distinct from new businesses such as apart-hotels which are not rated but are in competition with the hotel and guesthouse sector. If the Minister were to take on board our suggestions, the rate base of the Dublin borough would be much broader and a good deal more equitable than at present.</P>
      <P>The extension of the rates base would also generate significant new revenue for the city. We are therefore talking about rates on apart-hotels, Government property and some guesthouses and bed and breakfast establishments.</P>

      <P>The whole purpose of a Second Stage debate is that we would put forward constructive proposals, some of which may be at variance with some of the provisions contained in the Minister's proposed legislation. Nonetheless it is worth taking these on board, otherwise we will have a continuation of what I have experienced much of since I came into this Chamber, namely, bland exchanges of ideas leading nowhere. I know the Minister will reflect on these points and he may well find a way of modifying them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, I am supportive of the objectives of the Bill. Making proposals for amendments in respect of State property and bed and breakfast accommodation is in accordance with the sugges<Col N="984" /> tions we submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government during our annual Estimates process over several years. Each year, when Ministers of various political hues have been in power, there is very little that is new forthcoming but as the revaluation process has not been visited since the 19th century, some of us were not around to participate in previous discussions on the matter.</P>
    <P>This is a complex Bill which will require a great deal of teasing out but it has significant implications for the rate base of local authorities. It applies to other institutions as well but they are the ones I wanted to address in my brief contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome Bill in the sense that any system which is based on 150 year old rules obviously needs to be updated. Modern day methods and efficiencies need to be backed up by modern laws and systems. In regard to some of the Acts that are repealed in this legislation, the earliest dates back to 1834 or 1836 and, thankfully, much has changed in the country since then. It is amazing that it has taken us so long to get into modern mode on this particular one.</P>
      <P>Members will make comments on aspects of the Bill with which they agree or disagree but nobody on any side of the House can argue with the fact that the Minister is updating a fairly archaic system. The Valuation Office, to a large extent, has got its act together over the past five or six years and the long delays that were previously experienced in having issues dealt with appear to be a thing of the past. It is timely now that clearer definitions, guidelines and structures be put in place because they will benefit both the public and particularly the local authorities carrying out business on our behalf.</P>
      <P>All of us who are public representatives, particularly those with a dual mandate, have had the frustrating experience of making inquiries on what we think is a logical approach to a valuation related issue or a taxation issue only to come up against some impediment which was designed 150 years ago. We had to change that system and I compliment the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is correct to say that there will be at least one element of the Bill which will lead to greater centralisation. That will be proposed in the new structures. The individual or indeed the company being rated will now be able to make representations directly to a valuation manager at the Valuation Office rather than at the local rate collector's office as heretofore. The benefits of that change will be equality of treatment for all, regardless of geographical locations, and it should in this instance at least outweigh the Government's decision to decentralise all Government functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can get into a philosophical argument about the fact that everything should be decentralised but that can lead to inequities in its own way. I have heard people from different parts of the country argue that they were being <Col N="985" /> treated in a different fashion to people from other areas. This is one time I would agree with centralisation because it will ensure a level playing pitch and fair treatment for everybody involved. It will remove that argument at least.</P>
    <P>The public, on hearing about the Bill, will be forgiven for thinking that it is purely a technical Bill which will not have any effect on their affairs or their normal routine but that is not true. Regardless of whether they have property of their own, this legislation will affect them because it is the basis for collecting much of the funds required to carry out developments and for the supply and maintenance of local authorities. It will have the effect, as has been referred to by previous speakers and my colleague, Deputy Carey, in particular who has an interest in this area, of broadening the rate base and getting properly funded local government. Part of that should be based on the premise that everybody pays their fair share.</P>
    <P>In the past certain parties objected to the principle of individual households paying service charges and in 1997 we made a decision, rightly or wrongly, to abolish domestic rates. That led to a shortfall in funding for local authorities which, in turn, has led to a situation where services that should be provided in an area are not being provided because we are constantly balancing the books. If we get away from those philosophical arguments, however, and look at the broader context, we would all accept that to have everybody contributing is a fair way to move forward. We accept that it will be for the betterment of local government to adopt and implement this kind of approach.</P>
    <P>As a totally committed local authority activist &ndash; I have 26 years service and had the privilege of leading my city as Lord Mayor &ndash; I have consistently argued that we need to broaden the rate base, make everybody contribute and ensure that the system is clear, that everybody understands it and that they are getting a fair deal. People would be willing to accept that if they see it done that way.</P>
    <P>Dublin has been fairly unique over the past few years in that it applied a different methodology to the majority of the country. It decided it did not need a local contribution and managed to work without it. That is changing, however, and I read that two or three of the new councils are accepting that there is a need for a local contribution as well as the commercial rate, and that is probably the way it should be. Any moves like that should be fairly balanced. In Cork Corporation and Cork County Council there is a waiver system in place to give people in the domestic situation an even chance.</P>
    <P>On the commercial rates, many people felt they were impediments to development, that the system was unfair and rigid with total inflexibility. That was the law, whether it dated back to Griffith's law or some other legislation. The Minister is now updating and changing that by bringing it into the modern era, and should be compli<Col N="986" /> mented for doing so. The rate base is the most crucial factor in the provision and administration of local government. People pay rates to help create the infrastructure and facilities in towns, cities and villages. Such places would not survive without such funding. There are conflicts and arguments in areas based on decisions by local representatives and the fact that differences in rates provide an incentive for people to locate businesses in particular areas. I am sure these points can be teased out and that a fair solution will be arrived at.</P>
    <P>It is important that everybody contributes a fair amount, that the system is seen to be fair and that people understand it and have proper redress when they feel they are wrongly treated. It is also important that businesses are treated alike, which has not been the case in the past when there have been crazy situations. For example, where there is a building in the middle of a city or town that has not been used for a few years a young person might decide to set up in business, revitalise the building and provide employment for himself or herself and perhaps a few others. When all the plans are put in place, the local rating officer descends on that person to say he or she owes £30,000 or £40,000 before starting business. On making inquiries about the matter he or she is told this is recorded in the valuation book in Dublin and that it cannot be waived. In effect, that person is told he or she cannot set up in business, give employment or brighten up the building which has been idle for many years. That is ludicrous and crazy and I hope it will be addressed. Appeals and other systems are being put in place, but I hope that situation in particular will change. I am not asking for an automatic wiping out of previous rates, but I ask for some flexibility so that reviews can be done on a case by case basis so rating officers are not hide bound by a law promulgated in 1836.</P>
    <P>It is important to state the Bill is not anti-business or designed to saddle any particular sector of business. The Government has built up an excellent record in that regard and is very much pro-business. The cut in corporation tax and the general low tax environment has created a situation where the largest section in almost any newspaper is advertisements for job vacancies, which is a huge change. This approach of a low tax environment, whether it applies to employers, employees or business, has been successful and is working, and I would like to see it continued.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to credit that the Griffith Poor Law valuation of 1838 was still being used as the basis for deciding eligibility for small farmers' assistants in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. It was challenged in the early 1980s and was found to be unconstitutional. I recall the hub-bub at the time. Though I cannot recall the exact ruling, I presume the timeframe of the legislation was a major factor in the decision made. It sounds ludicrous for the State to be working on a daily basis using parameters and systems dating back 160 years. It <Col N="987" /> is important that we move into the modern era and do things in a modern way.</P>
    <P>We will be asked what we are doing about A, B or C, and bed and breakfasts, a topical subject, have been mentioned. Like most other sectors, there is a big divide in that sector between a person with a traditional B&amp;B in a housing estate who lets out one, two or three bedrooms and runs it as a part-time business &ndash; I do not know how much profit they make &ndash; and people who own the buildings we see, particularly in rural areas and county towns, which in any international description, particularly by the French, would be described as family hotels. Many of them have 20 rooms to let, and are hotels to all intents and purposes, but they put up B&amp;B signs. Whatever about the pros and cons, it is necessary to examine this and come up with solutions. The Government and the Minister for Finance have proved in the past couple of months that they are not anxious to simply gather money from all sources. A provision in the budget allows people to rent out accommodation, tax free, which proves the Minister is not there merely to rake in cash from all possible sources. We want to be fair in our approach and as rational as possible. However, a review should apply to people who build a small hotel and call it a guesthouse. I am sure people will argue for and against this.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular specific parts of the Bill. Section 5 deals with the right of appeal. Rightly or wrongly there was always a feeling that it was a personalised approach by local rate collectors which decided how much people would pay or whether they got a waiver or write-off. I am glad that in future appeals will be made to a valuation manager and that he or she will be charged with the responsibility of overseeing the valuation process. If people wish to make an argument they will not have to make it to an individual who may be well known to them and whom they feel may be making a personal call or judgment. Many rate collectors have been almost described as vampires in that their job is to argue, fight and bring in the maximum percentage possible of their rate.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Ms Kathleen Lynch, the rate collector in Cork City. I do not know how much her role will change under this Bill. She has certainly educated most of the local authority members about the process, the pros and cons, the difficulties and how it works. She has been fair in her approach and has not simply blamed the Valuation Office in Dublin for all the negative things. She has explained her methodology and approach, and the percentage returns are among the highest because of her efficiency. In the process she has probably made a few enemies as she has to make a call on rates due.</P>
    <P>I am glad section 5 will provide for an appeal to a valuation manager. In the past there was a lengthy delay, but under section 7 the right of appeal is available to the High Court and the Supreme Court on the points of law and must be <Col N="988" /> done within 21 days of the tribunal's decision. I presume this has been worked out and that there will be a facility for access to the courts. Is it just that under section 7 the application must be made for the appeal within the 21 days? It is also important that the tribunal must state and sign a case within three months.</P>
    <P>In the past there was a feeling that large bodies move slowly. People trying to conduct business and to work were at a disadvantage. There have been radical changes in that regard and people have come up to speed and got their house in order. It is good, however, that these few changes are made.</P>
    <P>Public bodies are required to supply information to the commissioner if they believe such information would lead to an amendment of a valuation list in respect of a particular property. Though I do not worry about that I want to draw attention to it. I agree with the notion that the information is supplied &ndash; that is under Part 8.</P>
    <P>I agree with the notion that that Part is included and that the information is supplied but the changes that lead to the amendment of the valuation list concern me. North Main Street is the old historic spine of the city and we are now revitalising it. When I met many of the shop owners there five or six years ago and tried to encourage them to make changes, they explained that if, for example, they painted the front of a building or put in a new window they would have a revaluation within a month and their rates would increase. They would not have increased their turnover or their number of clients, but their valuation would automatically be increased. They were incorrect in saying their rates would be automatically increased but a case would be made and either the local authority or the Valuation Office would descend upon them and amend it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to try to ensure that someplace in the Bill there will be a provision that the simple refurbishing of the front of premises will not lead to revaluation. The shop or premises may look brighter and better and so on but it does not mean that there will be extra business or increased turnover. Officials may be taking note of this and I ask that it be built into the system that a simple refurbishment of a shop would not lead to an automatic or immediate revaluation as, in the past, such activity has led to an amount of dereliction and a number of run-down areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It can only improve the situation. To the people speaking against it, it is possible that we might agree issues raised and I hope any amendments introduced will give us a better outlook than we have had for quite some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cúpla tuairim a chur os comhair na Dála freisin i dtaobh an Bhille thábhachtach seo, go háirithe toisc go bhfuilim mar bhall de Chomhairle Bhaile Átha Cliath agus, toisc na deacrachtaí a bhí ag an gcomhairle <Col N="989" /> sin le déanaí, tá sé oiriúnach cúpla tuairim a chur os comhair na Dála dá bharr sin.</P>
      <P>It is a timely Second Stage debate on this Valuation Bill for those of us who are members of this House but who are also members of local authorities. I am member of Dublin City Council and it is particularly timely, therefore, because it was only in recent months that Dublin City Council faced abolition by the present Government and was threatened with abolition by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and his colleagues in Government due to the difficulties Dublin City Council was experiencing trying to meet the estimates required to provide services and run the business of the city.</P>
      <P>At that time there was a great deal of debate about rates and who was paying them, who should pay them and so forth, as, at a time of great affluence and given that Dublin City Council represents an area of Dublin city which contains the greatest single concentration of commercial and State properties in the State, it seemed incredible that we could not raise sufficient funding in the normal way to run the city.</P>
      <P>Although we examined this in great detail over many meetings, it transpired that we could not do this under the way the system works at present. The result was that a slim majority of the city council imposed what many of us regard as an additional tax on the PAYE sector in the city to pay for those services. To take one incredible example in that context, and many examples were put forward, given the proliferation of what we call multiple-occupancy dwellings, owned by private interests and private landlords &ndash; in many cases individuals or companies would own many properties &ndash; making vast amounts of money. They are running businesses and using properties for commercial purposes, i.e., making money from tenants, many of whom are unfortunate people dependent on health board subsidies. Ultimately these landlords would be making vast amounts of money from the taxpayer and yet would not pay rates.</P>
      <P>Many fellow members of the city council were not aware of that until we had this debate; they should have been but were not, and they found it extraordinary. I find it incredible given the tens of millions of pounds these people make.</P>
      <P>These people, particularly in Dublin city, are in a position to exploit the housing crisis to an extraordinary degree and enrich themselves in the process. Moreover, ironically these landlords were making vast amounts of money but were not paying their rates and, as a result, the taxpayer was being forced to provide an additional subsidy by way of service charges to meet the requirements of the estimates of Dublin Corporation and provide for the running of the city. On one hand the PAYE sector is doubly taxed, yet again, and on the other hand people enrich themselves to extraordinary levels and do not pay rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People were buying properties and putting them to commercial use but the properties, due <Col N="990" /> to the way the system works, were treated as residential and therefore exempt from rates.</P>
    <P>Does any Member of this House believe that that is fair, just or right? I do not and I would hope that the Government will take on board the suggestion that that should no longer be the case and that landlords, be they individuals or companies, should in future be obliged to pay rates on such properties. If that was the case, there is no doubt, given the proliferation of landlord owned properties in Dublin city and the vast amounts of money being made, that service charges or additional taxation would not have been enforced on the PAYE sector in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to some of the other areas where rates are not paid, for example, bed and breakfast accommodation. In addition to the traditional bed and breakfast accommodation, there is a new range of different types of such accommodation, some of which are exploiting the housing crisis in the city. Despite the commercial use of property, none of these pays rates. This is not acceptable at a time when people who are less well off are obliged to pay additional taxation to provide for services from which the people who own these establishments benefit. A more recent development is the apart-hotels, the exclusive apartment developments which are rented for astronomical figures to executives and rich individuals visiting the city. Vast amounts of money are made, yet nothing is paid by way of rates.</P>
    <P>There is also what many of us regarded as the ludicrous situation where the Government did not pay rates for State buildings in Dublin city at today's valuation. Assessments were made of the amount of money which would have accrued to Dublin Corporation if the State had paid rates for those buildings at today's valuation. The amount happened, by coincidence, to correspond almost precisely with the £14 million required for the running of the waste management services. We are told by a corporation official and the city manager that the money for these services will be raised by the imposition of service charges in the city. The Government threatened the city council with abolition, thereby getting rid of the democratically elected representatives of the city, because it could not find ways to meet the requirements of the estimates. Some of us thought this was amusing because if the Government had met its responsibilities in relation to State properties in Dublin city the city council would have had more than sufficient funding to provide for the needs of the capital city.</P>
    <P>It was not only the members of the city council who had come to the realisation that there was much inequality in the payment of rates in the city. At the time this debate was taking place the city centre business association had, by coincidence, also put together a document which, if I remember correctly, drew attention to the fact that rates were not paid for something in the region of 30% of the non-residential building in Dublin city. This seems to be an extraordinary <Col N="991" /> number of buildings. The association felt aggrieved that the State was not meeting its responsibilities. Far be it from me to argue on behalf of the business interests of Dublin city, but their argument was that they were paying the vast bulk of rates while the State was failing to meeting its obligation. This was a reasonable case for them to make.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with some of the association's members. I put it to them that it was not only the State which was not meeting its responsibilities and referred to the multi-occupancy dwellings which are a source of great wealth for the people who own them. These dwellings are a means of exploiting the taxpayer, who subsidises the rent in many of them. Despite the wealth they make from the rent, the landlords fail to keep the dwellings in a proper condition. In many parts of my constituency entire streets have been ghettoised as a result of their total irresponsibility and absolute greed, which is their sole motivation in buying these properties. I emphasise that point because if there is one anomaly which needs to be addressed, apart from the State not meeting its dues, it is the practice whereby landlords use for commercial purposes properties which are treated as residential and are exempt from the payment of rates.</P>
    <P>I hope the views expressed Deputies will be taken on board. Opposition Deputies should not have to fight for their inclusion in the Bill by way of amendment. Rather the Government should include them by way of amendment. There is no reason this should not happen. If there is clear inequity involved in these issues they should be addressed. This will make for a much fairer and more equitable system. I can only speak from my experience as a member of Dublin City Council and Dublin Corporation, but I have no doubt the same holds for local authorities in other areas. The system as it pertains will be divisive because people feel that a relatively small elite in this city makes huge wealth and does not give anything back. This élite utilises and exploits the services of the city and is assisted in amassing wealth by the fact that it does not have to pay its fair share. This Bill provides the opportunity to address important issues such as those I suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I largely agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Gregory. It is good that we are introducing this Bill which updates legislation which goes back 150 or more years. All legislation needs to be streamlined. There has been talk of this legislation for a long time. Interdepartmental studies and so on have been carried out but I am glad the Bill has finally come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over many years I have been involved in different discussions regarding bed and breakfast accommodation. I am not referring to the current Minister of State, but the relevant Minister has often been from a rural constituency. However, Deputy Cullen comes from a city. When one talks <Col N="992" /> about bed and breakfast accommodation the Minister or the Department always seem to think in terms of Mrs. Murphy on the Dublin Road who has two or three rooms and who takes in a few lodgers on a couple of weekends in July and August. No matter who is in Government, this view always seems to set the tone and standard for the debate and succeeds in getting people to back off.</P>
    <P>The definition of what constitutes bed and breakfast accommodation must be tackled. I agree with Deputy Gregory's comments and all Members, particularly those from Dublin, would say the same. The profile of residential accommodation has changed significantly. It must be possible to define bed and breakfast accommodation. One could do so on the basis of Deputy Pat Carey's suggestion distinguishing premises with more than five or six rooms or one could do so on the basis of occupancy levels.</P>
    <P>Someone in the west may have five rooms which he or she lets out for a couple of weekends in the summer. Alternatively, someone in Dublin may also have five rooms but may let them 52 weeks of the year. The situation regarding bed and breakfast accommodation has changed and that is before one addresses apart-hotels, commercial outlets and the large commercial operations referred to by Deputy Gregory. We must tackle this problem and it is illogical that rates are not charged on bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>We need to get away from the traditional label &ldquo;bed and breakfast&rdquo; as it seems to frighten Ministers. It should be possible to define what we mean &ndash; whether the definition is based on the number of rooms or the number of bed nights per year. We must tackle this issue and I regret it is not included in the Bill. I hope the Bill will be changed. It is a question of definition. People should not automatically think of Mrs. Murphy on the Dublin Road but that is what people from rural areas think of and I understand why.</P>

      <P>No one wants to tell Mrs. Murphy she will have to pay rates. However, the situation has changed and we must address the definitions of residential, apart-hotels and the large concerns which are now in operation. There is much evasion which ought to be tackled and this is the opportunity to do so. People have been talking about a Valuation Bill for years and if we chicken out now we will not get back to this issue for a long time. I hope the Minister of State changes the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like all legislation, this Bill will be implemented on a national basis. One cannot have one rule for Dublin and another for the west. However, it is a matter of defining what is residential and what is not. We should ignore those offering bed and breakfast accommodation for a few nights in the summer and tackle the issue. This is a large problem and given the scale <Col N="993" /> of operations in Dublin it would be a scandal if we let this opportunity pass.</P>
    <P>I apologise for sounding repetitive but it happens that a number of speakers in the House are from Dublin. All speakers on this Bill seem to be from the same party, apart from Deputy Gregory, and I am delighted to see someone from a different party speaking. However, Labour Party and Fine Gael Members would say the same thing and I am disappointed some of them are not in the House.</P>
    <P>The city council recently went through a crisis regarding striking a rate and agreeing Estimates for the year. Over seven council meetings many Opposition councillors had all the ideas in the world. The long awaited Valuation Bill was quoted and was certain people's Bible. Those people did not want to bite any bullet or do anything. Their only suggestions involved funny money. A few were brave enough to suggest cuts which would have destroyed the city but they spoke about what we could or should do with this Bill. They had all the ideas in the world over seven meetings, one of which went on for eight hours. However, I do not know where they are. Fine Gael Members may be seeking promotions but I do not know where the others are. They have gone on a sulk. It is a shame that having spent weeks talking about what they were going to suggest as regards this Bill, they do not have the neck to come into the House and speak. However, that is a political point which is not related to the Bill proper.</P>
    <P>As regards Government buildings and State properties, some years ago a lump sum was paid <i>in lieu</i> of rates. This should be reintroduced. I thought we had moved away from the era when the State was a special case, and we have done so under many other headings. There was a time when the State and its agencies thought they were special under planning laws. However, the courts decided that the State and its agencies should go through a planning process, even if it is not quite the full shilling. This is the age of transparency and so on and the idea of exempting State properties is antiquated and old fashioned and belongs in the era before transparency and accountability. We should grapple with this problem.</P>
    <P>I am coming at this issue from a Dublin perspective where local authorities feel they are providing a service but are not getting the tax or revenue. I do not see why the State should have special status. In this regard we should consider the changes which have taken place in the planning process. I may be incorrect but all land, including farm land, is exempt from rates. I am not proposing we should put rates on anyone's cows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Committee on the Environment and Local Government we talk a lot <Col N="994" /> about the housing problem. There is little land left in Dublin. The land available in north Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, on which there are cows, is valued at a certain amount. Am I correct that if the council rezones it and it becomes a valuable asset, rates will not be payable on it? Perhaps someone could clarify that. My understanding is that the rezoning of land does not give it any value.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is always talking about the amount of money he has invested in zoned land under his serviced land initiative. The Government is pouring millions of pounds into it and this is helping developers to build more new houses. We complain about developers who will not build and who are sitting on zoned and serviced land on which they are not paying any rates. We wonder why the Government has not invested the money in infrastructure and why we cannot force these people to build. Zoned land and land which has benefited from the serviced land initiative should be subject to rates. It seems contradictory that the Government is pouring millions of pounds of taxpayers' money into certain land yet we complain that the developer is sitting on it and will not build. The Government wants the developer to build but he just wants to produce 200 or 300 houses a year which will keep him, his family, his company and his workers in employment.</P>
      <P>We are giving them all the carrots in the world, namely, the money which is being poured into the serviced land initiative, but there is no stick. The only stick is capital gains tax which might be higher in a few years' time. Zoned land should be subject to rates and serviced land should be valued at a higher rate. That is the only stick we can use to force developers to build. It seems silly if one Minister is giving all the carrots and another Minister is not using the stick when the opportunity arises. I could list the number of serviced land sites. There are 70,000 or 80,000 sites in the Dublin area alone of which only a fraction are being developed. They should be subject to rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue is topical in Dublin City Council. I am disappointed that speakers from Dublin constituencies on the other side of the House have not come in here this morning. There has been tremendous development in Dublin over the past ten or 15 years. The rate base of the city has decreased because many companies and stores have had their property devalued. There is no doubt the city has improved enormously, particularly when one remembers the wasteland it was ten or 15 years ago. However, local authorities must also survive. It is easy for the Government, regardless of which parties are in Government, to give tax breaks and rates relief for ten years without compensating the local authority which must provide the services. The rate base of the city is beginning to recover. It may show a net improvement in the next few years as some of the places which were built eight and ten years ago come into it. However, it will be the first net improve<Col N="995" /> ment for many years. I wonder if we are being too generous by giving ten years' relief without compensating the local authorities affected.</P>
    <P>I understand a cap will be imposed so that the revaluation will not lead to extra money being given to local authorities. Local authorities should not abuse it and get 50% extra revenue from it. However, I do not know if it is right to tie it too tightly to increases in the consumer price index. I would like to think there would be some flexibility. We all talk about giving local authorities extra power. However, power means responsibility. If we want local authorities to use their power, we must give them responsibility.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will not abuse their rates because they are in competition with other local authorities, particularly in the Dublin area where there are four local authorities within the county. I am told the valuation of Dublin, Galway, Cork or any city is low compared with Belfast or Manchester. Given how local authorities scream and shout every year, one would think the last pound was being taken from their pockets. However, it is not businesses that pays the rates because businesses are only the agencies which collect them from the punters. Dublin and Galway are in competition not only with other cities within the State but with major developments in Belfast, Liverpool and Manchester. Our rates are not high. It is the responsibility of different local authorities to maintain a competitive edge. If Fingal County Council increases its rates, the shops in Blanchardstown will be more expensive than those in Dublin. Every local authority must be responsible and strike a balance.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister considers these issues. I will not discuss the Bill in detail because much of it is technical. Issues, such as that related to bed and breakfast establishments and rates on Government property, must be tackled. The points I made about zoned and serviced land should be taken on board. The issue of bed and breakfast establishments is about definition. It is a case of finding out how to draw the line. It would be a disgrace to lose this opportunity. I know there are different arguments and it has been a battle at Cabinet level. However, it is a bigger issue than Mrs. Murphy using a few rooms in the summer as a business. She should be excluded. This issue should be dealt with properly. The residential area has developed in many ways in the city and in rural areas as a result of the introduction of tax incentives. People are not using property as their first or second home so local authorities should get money from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spent a long time listening to many Governments talk about doing something about the valuation system. I, therefore, welcome the Bill. Like many other Members I have had many approaches from people who genuinely believe they were crucified by the way the system worked in the Valuation Office. I will return to that issue later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> When one considers that £456 million is riding on the method of calculating rates on commercial and industrial premises, one can see that it is a huge funding reservoir. It is also a huge taxation matter for property owners. While this is not a political point, over the years I have not ever heard more bitter rows being fought with great gusto about the method of valuation and revaluation of business premises, particularly in my part of the world. Businessmen and industrialists have told me that whatever way the base assessment was made, they could not see a relationship to the earning capacity of the business, whether it was a small village supermarket or a local garage. Comparing such a garage in a remote area that might not often see the Celtic tiger, with a garage in the same county, but near a major road with greater access to business and customers, it is difficult to understand that the same criteria was used.</P>
    <P>I know the deductions that are made and I fully understand them, but from what I have read in the Bill I fail to understand how that will be changed. The central theme is that there must be some tie-back element to the earning capacity for that year or the preceding year. It is a bit like a notional assessment or the assessments that were done on farm land in the 1980s where one paid so much per acre. Much work was done on that as an alternative to farm tax. I did not find out what happened to all the work that was done on that occasion, but when Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1987 that was forgotten about and we went over to the ordinary taxation system for all farmers.</P>
    <P>The valuation issue has not been touched for many years. There are some aspects of the Bill I do not fully understand, including how the capping will be done. If I was cynical and particularly if I owned property, I would have to say that while the system might become more fair it will also become more expensive. In other words if there is to be a revaluation it will be upwards and that is what many business people are afraid of. On Committee Stage, the Minister will have an opportunity to explain in detail what he means by capping. How will the Minister cap it? I hope this will be well thought out. I am not a businessman, but I can imagine that there must be some element of fairness in this. I can see a few areas where it could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it will depend on the level of the cap. If the cap is very high there will be an opportunity for local authorities to drive it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will tease it out on Committee Stage but there is a huge suspicion around the country that that will happen. The Minister <Col N="997" /> will have an opportunity to explain the matter further on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>To return to the appeals part of the legislation, the Minister is building in a consultative process at the beginning. One of the things that has always amazed me about valuations, no more than with accountancy which is a fine industry, is that a group of valuers has grown up around them. They do a professional job and people pay them to look after their businesses. In my time in politics I have noticed that they have made a very good living out of this work. As the Minister is aware, many of them work on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; system whereby if the valuer can do nothing for a client the latter is not charged, but if a reduction in the valuation is obtained then the client pays the valuer 50% or 75% of the first year's savings. I assume that is well known to everybody and I know many people who do it. Under the system proposed in the Bill, it will be no different. There will be greater opportunities for interpretation which, as the Minister knows, often means that all sorts of professionals will get in on the act.</P>
      <P>I do not understand how the consultative process, to which the Minister referred, will work. I assume what the Minister has in mind is a mechanism whereby the property owner can talk to the Valuation Office face to face or, as the Americans say, eyeball to eyeball. That could be a useful first step and many people would like to be given that opportunity.</P>
      <P>I assume there will be no change in the rating responsibility which will remain with local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in that so there will be some element of local democracy at work all the time. We all accept that if a property has not been revalued for many years it is likely to be revalued upwards. I cannot understand how it could be any different. Once properties are revalued it is not so much a question of the actual valuation, but rather that everybody wants to know how it relates to the valuation of the pound when we strike the rates. I am glad that farm land has been omitted from the provisions of the Bill. It is extremely important that the Minister has done that because we have enough problems in the agricultural sector without having rates returning to farm land. If the valuation base is brought up, and I think that will happen, obviously the rate in the pound will have to decrease dramatically.</P>
      <P>I would like to know where the cap will come into operation. For example, Galway County Council has to get whatever revenue it can to make up its accounts. There is a great opportunity here for officialdom to extract more rates through this mechanism, but I hope the Minister will not stand for it. While the rate in the pound could be reduced from 40p to 20p, at the same time, because the base valuation is higher, we could be taking much more money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope that figure will not be much higher than the current one. Perhaps I am cynical, but I can see trouble coming down the tracks on this one, big time. It will provide an opportunity to local authorities to jump on this bandwagon as well. That is why I want to hear the Minister's views on how the capping mechanism will be implemented. Will it be related to the intake of rates at present? In other words, if this Bill goes through in 2001 &ndash; and I assume it will &ndash; will rates collected under whatever headings in 2001 bear a direct relationship to what will happen in 2002? Is that where the connection is? One could cap the rates but bring in a new higher valuation system. There would be a huge jump the first year and there would be a connection after that. That is something the Minister would want to watch extremely closely.</P>
      <P>I notice this will be done on a roll in basis and I confess I do not understand what is meant by that. Does it mean that in each county council and corporation area, this will be done over a number of years? In other words, will it be done in instalments?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The whole country will not be done together and it will be done over a number of years. That is seems reasonable enough.</P>
      <P>I come now to what I regard as a remarkable inclusion which I cannot understand. I see that the property of Teagasc, the farm advisory body, will be included for valuation from here on in. I find that very difficult to understand at a time when schools as such are exempt, and rightly so. If one takes the research end of Teagasc&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not want to be included. On the one hand, Teagasc will come back to the Exchequer to look for money to keep its show on the road while an the other hand, another Minister will take money from it. Obviously, that would not make sense. In so far as its buildings are concerned, would the State run college in Athenry, for instance, be exempt?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Any of the fund generating sources Teagasc has go back into the carousel that helps to promote education for young farmers, the research element and all the other things Teagasc does. That is something to which we will have to come back.</P>
      <P>The health boards are included on the new hit list. At a time when the Exchequer must put millions of pounds into the health services, is this not an example of robbing Peter to pay Paul? I find it difficult to understand from where that is coming. I like the idea of exempting fish farms. That is reasonable because, at the best times, they have plenty of trouble. They are located in peripheral areas of the country where there are few opportunities. That is a very wise move and the fishing people will be delighted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noel Ahern spoke about bed and breakfasts. We would have awful trouble if bed and breakfasts were included. There would be an exodus of people who provide a very useful service for two or three months of the year. They would not bother to provide this service because a valuation officer would be looking in the window two months later and the few pounds they got would be of no use given the trouble into which they would walk. I do not know enough about the Dublin scene but accommodation is provided in the best environment and in the local areas where tourism grows and prospers. That accommodation is made available by house owners when their children are away on holidays and the woman of the house makes a few pounds. I am against anything that will interfere with that and, officially, the Minister is against that as well. It would not be worth the hassle and I think the tourism industry would be the loser in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people in the business knew this had to happen but I hope I will not be back here in a year's time saying that the golden goose is laying <Col N="1000" /> better than ever and that the new valuation system has meant not only £450 million but another £100 million on top of it, all in the name of fairness and equity. Will the Minister give us a clearer idea on the capping process?</P>

      <P>This Valuation Bill is very important and that is why I am disappointed that the other parties have not taken part in the debate. The Government in 1995 set up the consultative process to bring about an updating of the question of valuation. As we heard from the Minister and other speakers, the valuation legislation goes back to the 1830s and 1840s, more than 150 years ago. Over the years things have changed, as happens in life. Many changes are coming on stream. We need a root and branch examination of legislation to bring it up to date. This is what the Bill does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister of State made it clear a number of times that he wanted to assure the people the change in the system of valuation is not for the purpose of increasing the rate take <i>per se.</i> There will be a change in the valuation basis bringing the net annual value into operation. The rate in the pound will change downwards in most cases in order to ensure people are not charged fantastic amounts of money. An example the Minister gave was that the rateable valuation could change from being £100 to £30,000 but that the person's rate charge will not increase 30,000 times whatever the rate <Col N="1001" /> in the pound is. It is important to get across to the general public that this change does not necessarily mean there will be a huge rise in the rates charged.</P>
    <P>The rateable valuation will be confined to a rateable area such as east Cork. East Cork will not be the same as west Cork. That is a good idea or perhaps it would be confined to counties. I agree wholeheartedly that it should not be on a national basis. The Bill provides for exemptions on domestic property, agricultural land, State-occupied property and so on. Other buildings I would wish to have included for exemption purposes are dressing rooms for sports clubs, whether soccer or GAA. Most clubs have dressing rooms merely for togging out which cost a couple of hundred pounds. Will the Minister look at this area to see if it is feasible to have an exemption. Some clubs have bars and so on, but that is a different kettle of fish. Where business is transacted should be included and rated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. In the long term it will be beneficial to the system and will help to bring the valuation scene into the 21st century.</P>

It is most unfortunate that other matters got in the way of the main Opposition parties being involved in an important discussion.

Many Members who are still members of local authorities contributed to the debate. I am pleased that even those who contributed from the Opposition gave a general welcome to the new Valuation Bill. There is an understanding in the House of the thrust of the Bill and the direction in which it needs to go.</P>
      <P>Matters raised in the debate here inevitably raised issues in regard to striking the rate in the pound or issues that relate properly to the local authorities. There will be an opportunity for further discussion of the issues that specifically relate to the Bill on Committee Stage. I will be happy to point Deputies in the direction of other matters with regard to issues that have been raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost unique in the context of this Bill, I, my officials, the commissioner and senior staff from the Valuation Office spent some time touring the country. It was an important exercise in that we chose key locations which we thought would encompass broad regional areas. We invited all the interested parties to come to public sessions, well in advance of the publication of the Bill, to tease out many of the issues that could and would be involved in it. I enjoyed that process which was a valuable one for me and everyone involved in the drafting of the Bill. We got feedback and information and heard the concerns raised by the local authorities and the commercial sector rep<Col N="1002" /> resented by various bodies from the Chamber of Commerce to business councils etc. If I was not to be involved in a Bill of this nature again it was an interesting and worthwhile exercise.</P>
    <P>Many issues were raised in the debate but obviously we will deal with these at greater length on Committee Stage. One of the points raised related to a rolling revaluation. I shall try to respond to Deputy Connaughton in this regard. One local authority area will be completed at a time. In other words, an entire county council or an entire corporation area would valued. When that valuation base has been established the reference points for the valuation base will be within that local authority area on a particular date. If we were to try to value the entire country at the same we would choose a point that would be relevant to the entire country at the same time. By the time the process would be completed it would be some years down the road. I want to keep the valuation base up to date. This is a fundamental point. Neither I nor any Member wants to wait another 150 years to bring in legislation to value the entire country. One of the points raised at the public meetings around the country by various interested parties was that once the country has been valued, which will be in about five years, we will continue the process on a rolling basis; in other words, every place will be valued within ten years. In that way we will never be in a position in which the valuation base will be questionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the purchase for destruction scheme. This scheme was introduced by the European Union as a market management measure in order to remove surplus beef from the market arising from the decline in beef consumption in the Union and the closure of many third country markets because of BSE. In general, cattle over 30 months of age that have not been tested for BSE, may be offered by producers for purchase and destruction under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been suggestions in relation to a targeted cull of cows. The feasibility of such a proposal is under active examination but there are limiting factors, not least the difficulty in building an adequate epidemiological profile because of the low levels of BSE. In this regard it should be noted that cows slaughtered under the scheme account for 31% of the total.</P>
      <P>We have a comprehensive range of measures in place to control and eradicate BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herd mates, birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals.</P>
      <P>This regime has been independently verified by a number of independent bodies, including the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission, and found to be operating effectively. The conclusions of the EU Commission's geographical risk assessment of member states and third countries last year was that the system operating in Ireland has been &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo;, since 1 January 1998. The Deputy will also be aware that these measures have been supplemented by a programme of targeted active surveillance for BSE among fallen and casualty animals, and that all cattle over 30 months of age entering the food chain are now being tested routinely for BSE.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied this range of measures is proving effective, and that it provides a sound basis for consumer confidence in beef, and for the protection of public health.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that it now seems the only source of clinical infection of BSE is to be found in older animals, principally cows? Does he agree that the only transmission vector found so far is the ingestion by other bovines of infected meat and bonemeal and that the most likely place in which any continuing source of infection will be found is among older cows between the ages of four and eight years? If he agrees that is so, does he further agree that the most rapid route towards eliminating BSE is the elimination of the animals in this category and, therefore, we need a targeted cull of cows? Will he outline the considerations he believes are relevant in deciding on a targeted cull? We know he is considering this. His Department officials said as much to the Oireachtas committee yesterday. <Col N="1004" /> It was a very useful discussion for which the Members of the committee were grateful. Will he outline the other considerations regarding a targeted cull that seem to be causing a problem so that we all know what exactly we are facing in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's analysis of the problem. That is the best scientific advice that we have been getting to date. A targeted cull would accelerate the decline in the number of clinical cases of BSE. The matters that are being actively looked at by the Department at present are that there are more than two million cows and about one million of them were born prior to 1997. Last year, the last one for which we have figures, some 100 positive cases occurred in animals in that category. What we must do is look for 100 cases in approximately one million cattle. That presents its own difficulties but the Department is working with John Griffin of UCD on the epidemiology routine analysis which he has done. We are looking at it on a geographical basis. Places such as Cavan-Monaghan would appear, on the face of it, to have a higher incidence. There is also the suggestion that feed mills in particular geographical regions should be looked at. They are the measures being examined.</P>
      <P>I stated publicly when the destruct scheme was being introduced that there would be difficulty with the logistics of it and that after a few weeks we would see if it could be targeted more specifically. That is being done at present. I emphasise that it has no public health merit. All the public health measures are in place but it would accelerate the decline in clinical cases of BSE.</P>

      <P>This is a problem which, if we deal with it correctly, can be dealt with in six minutes. If not, it will be with us for years. It is important. Does the Minister agree that as long as those animals where clinical infection is likely to be found are kept out of the human food supply we will have done all we can to prevent the repercussions of this disease spreading to humans? Does he agree that the policy of herd depopulation and the elimination of birth cohorts where cases are found limits the possibility of collateral infection? That being the case, and as all these animals are kept out of the food supply, if we target the only known source of clinical infection we will be able to say we have done the maximum possible to keep this disease out of the human food chain. Does he agree &ndash; and this is important &ndash; that if we have a targeted cull among animals that are most likely to have clinical infection we will have achieved two results &ndash; we will take out animals that could possibly pass the infection to others and if all the other animals in that category are kept out of the human food supply we will have sealed it off against the possibility of infection? <Col N="1005" /> Does he agree that is a compelling argument for a targeted cull? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy for herd owners who experience a case of BSE in their herds and I assure the Deputy that such cases are treated with great sensitivity and discretion. Officers from my Department, particularly from the local district veterinary offices, are in regular touch with the herdowner during the time from confirmation of the disease to final clearance of the farm. At time of positive confirmation of the disease, an information note issues to the herdowner setting out the entire process and the various options available with regard to valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Department valuer normally makes contact with the herd-owner shortly after positive confirmation of BSE with a view to valuation of the herd being carried out within two weeks of the date of confirmation. There is no fixed time frame laid down in legislation for the valuation to be agreed. The herd-owner may need time to consider the initial valuation, or alternatively may wish to avail of the appeals procedure laid down in the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Amendment)(No 2) Order, <Col N="1006" /> 1990. The latter provides for recourse to independent valuation, and ultimately to an arbitrator, should the herd-owner wish to pursue this course of action. The herd will be slaughtered normally within one week of the conclusion of the valuation process although this can vary having regard to the size of the herd and the capacity in the sole approved slaughtering plant.</P>
    <P>For a variety of reasons, a backlog of herds awaiting valuations had arisen but I am pleased that these have now been dealt with fully. In recognition of the difficulties created for the herd owners involved by the delays in commencing valuations, my Department has arranged for interim payments of compensation and in addition is finalising arrangements for the granting of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments to the herd owners involved. The current valuation arrangements have a statutory basis. My Department is considering how the process might be further streamlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is traumatic for farmers and their families when an animal with BSE is identified in their herd? Will he agree that a dedicated unit should be established in the Department to advise farmers in preparing for depopulation and to assist in the building up of the herd afterwards? Will he agree that the Department should provide a counselling and therapy service for farmers who have suffered such a trauma, as happened to farmers in my county in mid-December? Will he also agree that the compensation mechanism established under Statutory Instrument 195 of 1990 is 11 years out of date and fails to take account of the ancillary costs involved for farmers? Will he agree that farmers who must get rid of milk and feed fodder to animals that will be taken away should be compensated? Is it not time the regulation was updated and brought into the new century, because it fails to take account of the ancillary costs to farmers who have had this major upset in their lives and whose ability to earn a farm income has been diminished? Will he ensure that the depopulation process in speeded up from the date of identification to taking the animals off the farm? To cut down on the ancillary costs involved, will he try to speed up the process, provide a counselling service for farmers and ensure that Statutory Instrument 195 of 1990 is updated to take account of the major losses incurred by farmers? </P>

      <P>Having a BSE breakdown or a BSE positive animal found in a herd is about the most traumatic thing that can happen to any herd owner. In many cases, two generations of a family have built up a herd and it is extremely traumatic to see it depopulated or destroyed. I have sought to implement a scheme which is sensitive and takes into account these human factors in a speedy manner. I regret the delay which took place just before Christmas and recently but, thankfully, that backlog has now been dealt with. <Col N="1007" /> Under normal circumstances, from the date of detection to the date of payment is usually quite short and 30 days are allowed for cleansing, sterilisation and repopulating. I will seek to ensure that the whole process is speeded up as much as possible. In the meantime, market value is paid and if a herd owner is not satisfied, he or she can use the appeals system and the case can go to final arbitration. We are in continuous dialogue with the social partners on all these matters in relation to valuation and so on.</P>

It was recommended by the Agrifood 2010 Committee that these be joined into one and there were discussions with these committees in that regard.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the public health aspects of BSE are our primary concern. Much of what I hear suggests that the market support mechanism rather than consumer confidence is being addressed primarily. All the evidence indicates that BSE is not obvious in younger cattle. Perhaps they are in a pre-clinical state, but it is in the older animals that infectivity is most likely to occur. Surely on that basis alone it makes sense that there would be a targeted cull of older animals.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the appearance of BSE in animals, especially in certain counties? The data currently available suggests that these counties should be targeted. Within certain areas there are BSE hot spots. In view of this does the Minister not agree that a cull should take place on a geographical basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a two pronged approach to BSE. The primary consideration is public health. On a number of occasions, including today in the House, I have outlined the control measures in place from a public health point of view. The second consideration is the market and market related measures. On the question of culled cows, BSE is an extremely complex condition. Deputy Upton spoke in the House on this aspect before Christmas during Private Members' business. She is probably more familiar with the scientific aspects than are most Deputies.</P>
      <P>BSE normally occurs in the first year of life of the animals and it then takes anything from two to ten years before clinical signs appear. Typically, they occur in the range of five to seven years. For there to be a reduction or acceleration in the number of clinical cases there is no doubt that a cull of those animals would be beneficial, but it would not add anything to the public health aspect. We are seeking to in some way target the cull because in a herd of approximately one million there would be approximately 100 animals in the age group of five to seven years and it is not easy to find them.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the geographical distribution of reported BSE cases in 2000 showed that the recorded incidence was higher in some counties than in others, as suggested by the Deputy. For example, 23% of the 145 cases were diagnosed in herds based in Counties Cavan and Monaghan. The animals in these counties account for approximately 7% of the animals at risk of developing the disease. The level of disease in these counties was also higher than average in the previous years and not alone in 2000. We are looking at that. John Griffin from UCD is helping with this analysis and we hope to have all the data put together shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any kind of cull would have to be scientifically based because otherwise if one million cattle were culled then according to an estimate I saw it would cost £3 million per infected animal. Finding the infected animals is the problem. I will consider the Deputy's suggestion, but I would point <Col N="1011" /> out that initiating such a scheme is being actively worked on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for identifying the counties most affected, although this information has been available since 1998. Data available to me indicates that when the averages are considered there were three and a half times more cases of BSE in those counties than in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the epidemiology, will there be a traceability scheme to find out about the animals that moved from one farm to another? The movement around the country of those born in certain counties, especially Counties Monaghan and Cavan, must be addressed. It is not simply a matter of considering the animals currently identified within those counties but the movement of animals. BSE is occurring in other counties in Munster and so on. From where did those animals originate? The origin is important and the traceability of that should now be in place.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that we have a comprehensive and effective traceability scheme in place. Each calf born, especially since 1998, is recorded and given a passport. The scheme was recently updated and all herd owners were communicated with. There was a very good response, although approximately 20,000 have still not responded to that census.</P>
      <P>It would be in the best interests of all, especially herd owners, to have a tight traceability system, although the one we have in place is effective and is more advanced than that pertaining in any other EU member state. It is used for tracing cohort and feed cohort animals that might have had the same source of supply. All such cases are being followed up in a scientific way.</P>

      <P>One of the results of the negotiation of the Agenda 2000 package was an increase of 2.86% in our national milk quota amounting to 32 million gallons. Already, 20.5 million gallons have been allocated, 15 million gallons being allocated to 21,600 producers with quotas of less than 55,000 and a further five million gallons to 3,100 younger dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons. I set aside 500,000 gallons for distribution by the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal to special exceptional cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>My function in relation to exotic animals is confined to the issue of veterinary certification. Other responsibilities for such animals are shared by a number of Departments. The Office of Public Works has responsibility specifically for Dublin Zoo. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species &ndash; CITES &ndash; is under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Department of the Environment and Local Government is the competent authority in relation to Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999 relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the dispersed nature of responsibilities in this area, my Department took the initiative some time ago to set up an interdepartmental group to examine issues relating to dangerous and exotic animals in this country. While the group has held a number of meetings, it has yet to recommend how best to deal with such animals. It will in due course doubtless address the question <Col N="1015" /> of legislation and the appropriate authority to implement that. I am aware of the draft legislation proposed by the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and believe that it will be of interest to the group.</P>

The group has met on two occasions. At its second meeting the group decided to invite submissions from the public on dangerous and exotic animals and the Department, in consultation with other Departments, is currently drafting a press advertisement, which will appear shortly in a range of appropriate newspapers and periodicals, to get opinions on this area because it is a difficult one and there are people with expertise in it who want to bring these pets into the country.

I notice the Minister has reintroduced grant aid for deer. That is something we need to be careful of because there are many farm families who will never forget their experience and the way they were led astray in that area.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase for destruction scheme was introduced by the EU Commission as a market support measure to provide an outlet for beef for which there was no other market because of the decline in beef consumption in many member states and the closure of most of our third country markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU regulation governing the scheme provides for the destruction prices to be fixed on the basis of average Irish prices during the month of November 2000 and it requires member states, <Col N="1017" /> when fixing prices, to take account of traditional price differentials between categories and classes in the member state.</P>
    <P>The prices which have been fixed under the scheme reflect the traditional price relativities for the different classes of cows in Ireland. These prices give an average price of £360 per cow. It is not open to me under the EU regulation to fix a floor price of £350 per cow because that would not leave any scope to apply the traditional differentials between the different classes as required by the EU regulation.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the number of cows slaughtered under the scheme has been at reasonable levels in recent weeks and, as I said earlier, it amounted on average to 31% of the total kill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is anticipated that 400,000 beef cows will be slaughtered under the destruction scheme this year? The farming bodies, and farmers themselves, are very annoyed that ridiculously low prices are being paid for these cows and they are inclined to put weight on these cows before they sell them for the destruction scheme. As the Minister knows, the more weight on the frame of the animal, the larger the carcase to be disposed of. Surely it would be in the interest of the Department to adhere to the request from the farming bodies and establish a floor price of £350 per cow under the destruction scheme. That would at least give an incentive to farmers to dispose of the cows as quickly as possible and not put extra weight on them which will only create bigger problems in terms of the destruction scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is to support the market and take a backlog of beef out of the system. Beef farmers bought store cattle in good faith and fattened them for sale prior to Christmas. The market collapsed, there was a decline in consumption and a suspension of imports into Egypt and third country markets. The Commission had to find some way of dealing with this particular problem and it introduced this scheme. It was not anybody's preferred scheme, and it certainly was not my preferred scheme, but it was a scheme to take finished animals out of the system.</P>
      <P>The scheme has taken about 60,000 cattle so far out of the system and of that 60,000, over 18,000 were cows. It is incumbent on dairy farmers to put their cows into the scheme and not to fatten them to get the extra penny out of it. Beef farmers have put it to me that of the amount of money the scheme will cost, which will be very considerable, this is one way dairy farmers could get some of the finite amount of money that is available. Apart from all that, the EU regulation precludes me from putting a floor price of £350 for cows under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the EU, is lack of disposal capacity one of the reasons which might be inhibiting the Minister from examining the possibility of introducing incentives in regard to the elderly cow population, which has been proved statistically to be the most likely source of infection, as my colleague, Deputy Upton, mentioned? Is the Minister concerned that rather than take out the older cows because of the poor price, some farmers might put them in calf and there might be a drop in the normal culling rate, which is 18% or 20%, because of the decrease in price for culled cows over the past few months? Has the Minister given any consideration to a calf processing scheme or has that matter been discussed at EU Commission or Council level?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that cows have been sent back from factories because departmental officials thought they were too bare of flesh? I am speaking specifically of three cows which were transported from Donegal, through Sligo-Leitrim, to the factory in Clones, walked off the lorry and were walked back on the lorry again. It was a major catastrophe from a cruelty point of view that those animals were sent back to Donegal for further feeding to cost the Department more. That does not make sense. Can we not have common sense in this regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU regulation governing the scheme precludes a flat payment. Article 4 of Regulation 2777/2000 requires members states when fixing prices to take account of representative prices for relevant carcases and carcase qualities, and of the traditional price hierarchy between categories and classes. Apart from the regulation, there are a number of other considerations, the main one being that the real purpose of the scheme was to take out the backlog of beef in the system, which applied to finished cattle. There are more than 18,000 cows in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose asked specifically about our rendering capacity. The general rendering capacity has been inadequate. It is deplorable that we have carcases, risk materials of various kinds and meat and bonemeal being stored.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue raised by Deputy Crawford I am not aware of cattle being sent back because they did not have enough flesh on them, but I will follow up that matter. In relation to the calf processing scheme, I was disappointed that it was not included in Commission Fischler's seven point plan, for example, and I will take it up with him at the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 22 February.</P>

      <Quest>the number of herds depopulated under the BSE eradication programme in 2000; the number in 2001 to date; the number of such valuation cases which were concluded in each period; the average time elapsed between depopulation decision and valuation, and between valuation and payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2000, there were 145 cases of BSE in 141 herds with four other cases confirmed in cohort animals. Some 127 of these herds were valued and agreed in 2000. In total, 129 herds were depopulated following confirmation of BSE during 2000.</P>
      <P>Up to 8 February this year, there have been 24 cases of BSE. Of these, 18 cases have been valued and final agreement has been reached in 13 of these cases. The number of herds depopulated this year to date is eight.</P>
      <P>A Department valuer normally makes contact with the herdowner shortly after positive confirmation of BSE with a view to valuation of the herd being carried out within two weeks of the date of positive confirmation of BSE. There is no fixed time frame laid down in legislation for the valuation to be agreed. The herdowner may need time to consider the initial valuation, or alternatively he may wish to avail of the appeals procedure.</P>
      <P>The herd will normally be slaughtered within one week of the conclusion of the valuation process although this can vary having regard to the size of the herd and the capacity in the sole approved slaughtering plant. Payment normally issues within two weeks of receipt of the relevant documentation.</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, a backlog of herds awaiting valuation had arisen but I am pleased that these have been dealt with. In recognition of the difficulties created for the herdowners by the delays in commencing valuations, my Department has arranged for interim payments of compensation and, in addition, is finalising arrangements for the granting of <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the herd owners involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has cleared the backlog. How many cases are currently awaiting attention? Has he appointed new valuers to the scheme? How is the interim payment determined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>All the backlog has now been dealt with in terms of the valuers having carried out valuations. In some cases the depopulation has yet to take place. I certainly regret that this delay occurred. The trauma of the breakdown is bad enough without having animals left on the farm. In dairy herds, as most of them were, the milk had to be spread throughout the farm, which was an additional awful ordeal. As a gesture I agreed <Col N="1020" /> to an interim payment and an <i>ex gratia</i> payment for the losses incurred. I hope that with the valuation system in place and properly structured such a problem will not again arise. I have also been informed that a contributing issue to the problem was the lack of rendering capacity. The one rendering plant, namely, Monery, became completely clogged and was unable to cope with the difficulties, but it is thankfully back in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think an independent valuer should be introduced sooner? From some cases in which I was involved it seems the Department valuer visited the farm while the herd owner got a person to carry out an evaluation on the animals, with the assessment of an independent person being accepted. Things could be speeded up if an independent assessor was introduced sooner in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The process is fairly straightforward. Valuation is carried out by the Department's valuer. If the herdowner does not agree with the valuation there is an appeals procedure, with valuations from independent valuers, and an arbitrator. That process takes a number of weeks. It must be done in a professional way because while the herdowner is traumatised and seriously out of pocket, at least one herd owner is serving a jail sentence for infecting his herd. He would not have done this unless there was some benefit. Therefore, it is necessary for us to be extremely careful, as we are. I regret there was a backlog in recent weeks, but thankfully this has been cleared and I hope it will not recur.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am blamed for almost everything related to rendering and BSE. I am not responsible for rendering or incineration capacity. However, it impinges on the industry. A natural resource industry will produce animal waste which must be disposed of. Otherwise the industry must be closed. We were left with one processing plant &ndash; Monery &ndash; and when that buckled under the strain two plants applied for EPA licences, one in Waterford and one in Ballinasloe. Their applications are currently in train. Another plant in County Meath sought an extension of its low risk rendering capacity, and that has been commissioned. We are no longer able to export the problem because of the new regulations. In any event we must deal with the problem ourselves. The process for rendering capacity involves applying for planning permission and being granted an EPA licence. If we want a natural resource industry we must deal with the waste.</P>

      <P>It was recommended in 1997 that a facility be set up as a matter of extreme urgency under the control of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for the <Col N="1021" /> incineration of all BSE suspect carcases. What action was taken on foot of that recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in addressing that recommendation, as with addressing many other aspects of rendering capacity, is that we do not have an incinerator. Up to autumn 2000 infected cattle were buried on the farm on which they were found, under controlled conditions. Because of a difficulty in Galway, those carcases could no longer be buried on farms and are now stored in various places around the country, which is quite unsatisfactory.</P>

      <Quest>the total moneys allocated to his Department to fund the current BSE slaughter scheme; the length of time this scheme will continue; if he has plans to ensure that a market for beef will continue to exist following the withdrawal of this scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4237/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Commission Regulation 2777/2000 establishing the purchase for destruction (PFD) scheme, the EU will fund 70% of the purchase price of animals entering the scheme. The cost of the remaining 30% of the purchase price, together with all related transport, storage, rendering and other costs connected with the disposal of the carcases under the scheme, must be borne by the national authorities. The regulation also states the PFD scheme shall apply until 30 June 2001. It is currently estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of financing the PFD scheme for the six month period involved will be in excess of £100 million, based on a throughput of 300,000 animals. Clearly the cost will be determined by the number of animals slaughtered under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The destruction scheme is due to expire on 30 June 2001. However, the Commission has this week announced that it intends to replace the scheme with a special purchase scheme under which member states will have the option of either destroying beef or placing it in storage at their own expense. My Department is examining this suggestion which will be discussed at the Council of Ministers as part of the measures recently proposed by the Commission to deal with the surplus of beef within the EU market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By its nature the destruction scheme is a temporary measure to support the market at a difficult time. My strategy is to ensure that the maximum quantity of beef is marketed commercially. With this in mind, several measures, including the effective implementation of the wide range of controls, the extension of the definition of SRM and the introduction of rapid BSE testing for all cattle over 30 months, have been taken to increase consumer protection and help to restore consumer confidence in beef in the EU, which is a prerequisite to market recov<Col N="1022" /> ery in the sector and the reopening of those third country markets which have imposed a ban on the import of beef from the EU.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being and will continue to be made to convince our traditional import markets of the safety of Irish beef with a view to restoring normal trade in the least possible time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Since this is a demand led scheme, is it possible that the cost to the Exchequer could be substantially in excess of £100 million? If, for example, blast freezing and storage of specified risk material are involved arising from the EU slaughter for destruct scheme, could it be substantially higher than that?</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposals from the EU Commission for the special purchase scheme, would the Minister agree it is a bit rich of the EU Commission to expect the Irish taxpayer to foot the bill for intervention? I would favour the intervention mechanism even though it will mean an overhang in the market. Be that as it may, however, is it not a bit rich for the EU Commission to expect Irish taxpayers to foot the bill for storage of food which has proved, under tests at any rate, to be excellent, wholesome food? It expects us to foot the bill because EU member states failed to adhere to the rules and admit they had a problem?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the problem originated due to an ostrich like syndrome adopted by other EU member states who failed to play the game properly? Are we too good as Europeans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Penrose that the present problem is not of our making. Nothing has happened in Ireland and in the operation of the control systems which made any contribution whatsoever to the problem. The problem arose when member states in continental Europe, which officially had no BSE problem, suddenly found that they had a BSE problem. The worst of it is that we now contribute disproportionately to restoring balance and confidence in the market.</P>
      <P>For example, in the destruct scheme, apart from France and ourselves, just a small amount in Spain, Italy and Germany say they will, though not yet. They are not contributing in any way to the restoration of balance. We now have a proposal for nationally funded intervention or renationalisation. That is a non-runner and I totally disagree with it.</P>
      <P>The cost is somewhere over £100 million, though no one can say whether it is based on, say, 300,000 head of cattle. The likelihood is that it will be more than that. The contributory factors to the cost are increased as we do not have rendering capacity and the blast freezing and storing of waste material is at an inordinate cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked my Spanish colleague recently how he was dealing with his BSE problem. He said he was not getting much support from other Mini<Col N="1023" /> sters and that he was on his own. I asked him what he was doing with the meat and bone meal and he replied that there were plenty of furnaces in Spain, that it was a great energy source, that the cement industry use it and that it was a reduction in the cost of the overall matter. We are paying people to store waste material in Ireland when it is a good energy source. We cannot, however, get any part of any industry to use it. Many of those considerations will have to be taken into account to see what the overall cost will be but it will almost certainly be more than initially estimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister do anything to ensure that the measures we adopted were also adopted throughout Europe? Why were they not adopted throughout Europe? Has the Minister had discussions with the Department of Finance regarding the money this will cost? What pressure is this putting on the CAP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it right that we should ignore the 1997 proposal that this issue should have been dealt with then? It was inevitable that this would happen. Is the Minister aware that it is not animals over 30 months which constitute the problem at present? At least there is the culling scheme for that. There are, however, severe difficulties for farmers with younger cattle. Should we not examine the possibility of getting some of them into intervention at a reasonable price rather than feeding these animals to increase their weight thus making them even more difficult to handle?  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having intensive and regular meetings with the Department of Finance to monitor the cost of the scheme to ensure it will not go completely out of control and also to seek to ensure that the destruct scheme is not the best show in town or that it would be institutionalised as we want to get back to commercial markets as soon as possible. I feel strongly that export refunds, for example, should be substantially increased to get back into third country markets. Anyone who read the editorial in the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i> today knows that things are picking up a little, particularly in France, which would be helpful to us.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other countries &ndash; Germany, for example &ndash; they have decided to opt out and to dump their problem into other member states, including our own. It is bad enough for the Germans to do that but they could not do it without people in Ireland aiding and abetting by taking this cheap bull beef and processing it here.</P>
      <P>In relation to the CAP limit, there is a Berlin limit in the CAP and we will shortly be seeking that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined my position in relation to this group in Dáil Éireann on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously, this issue is extremely complex and has implications for the generality of milk producers in view of the limited amount of milk quota available. It is also the case that the State simply cannot be expected to take on legal responsibilities where they do not exist.</P>
      <P>The position is that no provision has been made in respect of any persons or group of persons who are not party to the proceedings in the Duff case and other associated cases. I have received legal advice to the effect that any proceedings that may be initiated by such persons are barred by the passage of time.</P>
      <P>However, notwithstanding this position, and despite the fact that there is no legal obligation to go further toward meeting the demands of the group in question, I have already indicated that I am prepared to look at what can be done in the context of the additional milk quota which will become available on 1 April 2001.</P>
      <P>I have consulted with the various social partners in the industry on this issue and specifically with the Milk Quota Review Group which is representative of all the main farming organisations. I will also have regard to the views of the Attorney General, given the complex legal issues involved, before I make a decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that time is running out on this issue and that by 1 April it will be too late? Would he also agree that this is a political decision he must make? Can he tell the House what he will do about it? Will the Government make a political decision to allocate justice to these people or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If this was not a complex issue it would have been addressed and sorted out before now. The problem exists and falls to be addressed now. I am obliged to have regard to legal advice given to me by the Attorney General in relation to this matter and that is what I will do. As I said, from a humanitarian point of view and an equity and fairness point of view, I have asked the Milk Quota Review Group to make recommendations to me on the matter as it is the relevant advisory body in relation to the distribution of the milk quota. There are conflicting demands for the relatively small amount of quota available, which is 11.5 million gallons. We will seek that amount to be fair to everyone in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it been possible to ascertain the number of farmers involved? This was one of the concerns of the Department. While I appreciate the legal nuances and niceties, is it possible <Col N="1025" /> to deal with this issue on a <i>ex gratia</i> basis? The Attorney General has referred to <i>ex gratia</i> ways of dealing with other problems. I know the legal advice, but would it be possible to deal with it on this basis so that those people who expected to get 10,000 and 15,000 gallons under the plan are accommodated? This problem was not of their making, no more than is the BSE problem, and they are the innocent victims. They do not want the optimum solution; a reasonable solution will suffice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>During the early 1980s approximately 20,000 farmers had plans under the farm modernisation scheme and 14,000 or 15,000 of those had included in their plans a capacity to increase milk production. One can only assume that when money is being paid out most of them would seek an allocation, in the same way as they would seek an allocation of milk. That is the only basis on which I can address this matter. I will look at it in the context of the 11.5 million gallons to be allocated, given the competing demands for this milk.

      <P>One of the results of the negotiation of the Agenda 2000 package was an increase of 2.86% in the national milk quota, amounting to 32 million gallons. Already farmers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons have got their allocation, while 3,100 younger farms have also got an increase in their quota. The balance of the 11.5 million gallons will be available this year and I am considering how this should be allocated. As usual, I will give careful consideration to the views of the Milk Quota Review Group in arriving at my decision. As the Deputy may be aware, although there is no legal obligation on me to do so, I have indicated that I am prepared to look at what can be done for the members of the Milk Rights Group in the context of the additional available quota. There are complex legal issues involved and I am awaiting legal advice in relation to them. When I have considered that advice, I will make an announcement on the allocation.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister referred to young farmers as it is important that they are <Col N="1026" /> encouraged to stay on the land and are given extra quota. However, it is equally important that small quota holders are allocated extra quota as many of them will not be able to survive without it. It is vital that these small dairy farmers are looked after. I also ask the Minister to look at what can be done for the Milk Rights Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the allocation of quota the priority category were farmers under 35,000 gallons who have an agricultural qualification or green certificate. They got the bulk of the milk which became available last year. The second category were farmers with up to 55,000 gallons. They got virtually all of the remainder &ndash; there was a small amount for those over 55,000 gallons. Since the mid-1980s preference has been given in all of the schemes and restructuring to smaller and medium sized farmers, and this will continue. This is a difficult process but the percentage of farmers in the 35,000-50,000 gallons range is increasing. The last restructuring scheme was helpful to these farmers. Last year 62.5 million gallons of milk became available. This was the amount of milk restructured during the previous five years. I hope we can be of further help to small and medium sized farmers in the allocation this year.</P>

In the Agenda 2000 negotiations the authorities who represent Northern farmers wanted to get rid of quotas altogether, while we want them retained. We were on different wavelengths in that regard.

      <P>The Department has received representations from the Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland regarding the cost of delivery of specified risk material to the relevant dedicated rendering plant. Its concerns have come about following the decision at EU level to increase the list of specified risk materials that must be dispatched to such a plant. There is no doubt that the addition of the entire bovine intestine to the list of specified risk materials with effect from 1 January 2001 has had the effect of increasing costs within the industry as a whole. The charges incorporate the costs of transporting, rendering, storing and disposal of the specified risk material. In the absence of a domestic disposal option the cost of these operations are obviously considerably higher than they might be, in view of the need to export. The Department has no reason to believe the charges are exorbitant or unfair in so far as they reflect rendering and disposal costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> With regard to the transportation of specified risk material, hauliers of specified risk material must be licensed by the Department in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Specified Risk Material) Regulations, 2000. At present there are 125 licensed hauliers and the Department will consider any application providing the transporter can meet the requisite standards. Butchers and domestic abattoir owners are licensed under this arrangement. In these circumstances, and given the free access to the haulage market, I see no reason to consult with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

I received a representation from the director general of the craft butchers. Anyone can obtain a haulier's or butcher's licence if he or she meets the criteria. There are regulations regarding the container &ndash; it must be leak proof, covered and so on. The Deputy is aware of the regulations. We are sympathetic to the situation. A number of people butchering in a town could have a vehicle licensed by the Department if they so wish. We are prepared to receive applications.</P>

    <Title>Report of Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to present to the House the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on its review of EU legislation and to bring a number of issues to the attention of Members. This report concerns the review undertaken by the committee in 1999 which was published in March 2000. The most important point we must recognise is the need for the House to debate reports at more regular intervals, particularly when they are first produced. It is useful to discuss a report at any time. However, discussing this report almost one year after its production will not be as effective as it would be if it was discussed, for example, last March.</P>
      <P>A review of the report will indicate the full extent of the work undertaken by the committee during the year. The committee produced 12 interim reports. Because of the magnitude and intricate nature of European directives and statutory instruments which come before it, the committee rightly decided that it could not sift through all the documentation produced in Brussels and identify the relevant sectors unless it sat for four or five hours every day, which is not feasible.</P>
      <P>As a result, the committee decided to engage the assistance of consultants whose job it is to vet legislation, examine its relevance from Ireland's point of view and report to the committee. The committee then examines these reports which are enclosed in the tabular statements and takes advice as to whether there were relevant issues involved. On some occasions the committee decided against the consultants' recommendation that there was a relevance and sought further communication from Departments. On other occasions the consultants rightly identified at an early stage the possible relevance of some legislation from an Irish point of view and the committee was able to get up to speed early in the process.</P>
      <P>As regards the production of reports of this nature, we must bear in mind the varying speeds with which European institutions move when they wish. On almost every occasion the committee sought a briefing document from the relevant Department and, in many cases, from the Commission. This enabled the committee to compare the two briefings and evaluate the extent to which it might be necessary to intervene. The process is very time consuming. We were lucky to have Curtin Dorgan as consultants who spent a great deal of time carrying out the initial sifting of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that the degree to which the EU will control our daily lives is <Col N="1030" /> increasing at quite a substantial rate. I do not wish to refer to the Nice agreement at this stage as it will be the subject of further discussion on the House in the not too distant future. However, the changes taking place in Europe post Nice are such as to give greater significance to discussions in the European Parliament as well as the thinking of the European Commission. This is because the European Parliament will have greater powers under the Amsterdam and Nice Treaties.</P>
    <P>In such a scenario, smaller member states will have to be more vigilant regarding decisions taken at central level. The natural reaction of smaller countries is that we should have more control over our own affairs and determine for ourselves what we wish to do. However, this runs counter to the concept of European integration. If each country decides to go its own way at any level the result will be disaster for smaller countries. This is because larger and more influential countries, and former colonial powers, know they are best placed to circumnavigate the system and have the most experience in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is why we must be vigilant and carefully vet the progress and origins of EU directives. I hope the House will be able to discuss reports immediately they are produced. It is difficult for the committee to get up to speed quickly enough to fully review a directive or statutory instrument or whatever.</P>
    <P>The committee has often been faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> where it is told that a directive has been agreed between governments and the European institutions so there is no point discussing it further. We now know that is not true because every directive can be amended at a later stage. When it has suited them, other countries have brought about amendments to directives already in place. It is important to emphasise this aspect of the committee's work.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues on the committee for their commitment in terms of time, energy and patience through this important but often tedious and technical work. Without their commitment, it would be impossible to do the job. I thank past and present staff of the committee for their help and assistance. I also thank the members for doing the work everyone criticises them for doing. For example, membership of the Joint Committee on European Affairs means travelling outside the country, whether we like it or not. If we did not go outside the country to examine the submissions made, we would not do our job properly. Unfortunately, we are criticised for that. However, it is better to be criticised for doing our job than for not doing it. I record my appreciation of the members of the committee for the forthright and cohesive manner in which they did their job.</P>
    <P>I hope the next time we have such a discussion, which I hope will be soon and on the Nice agreement which needs a thorough debate, we will have a longer period and that all Members of the <Col N="1031" /> House will be able to participate. I commend the report to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for presenting this report and I congratulate the Joint Committee on European Affairs for its work in this important area.</P>
      <P>The committee's ongoing work in reviewing the draft regulations and directives and the corresponding statutory instruments must at times be unglamorous. The minutiae of regulation necessary to implement the Common Agricultural Policy, the Union's Common Commercial Policy and the Single Market do not lend themselves to easy reading. However, in the interests of enhancing the democratic legitimacy of EU legislation, it is clearly desirable that our national Parliament should be directly involved in examining legislation which will directly affect the people.</P>
      <P>The co-decision procedure, adopted at Amsterdam and likely to be extended by the agreements reached at Nice last year, will increase the involvement of our directly elected representatives in the European Parliament in the legislative process, and this is to be welcomed. However, this does not detract from the importance of the direct involvement of the Oireachtas in the process. A distinctly national viewpoint must also be applied to EU legislation which will affect the daily lives of citizens. While this is a vital role for Irish Ministers in Council meetings, the input of the Oireachtas is also valuable. I am also keenly aware that the importance of involvement by national Parliaments in the EU's activities was recognised in a protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
      <P>In addition to the democratic accountability which this process serves to engender, the publication by the committee of this report also aids the transparency of the EU legislative process by pulling together in one place and in a digestible form the key items of EU legislation for the period. The documentation on which the committee bases its examination is currently made available to the public by the European Commission and through the Official Journal of the EU, but it is often in a form which is difficult and time consuming to follow. Transparency is a key imperative specifically provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Article 1 specifically mandates that decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely to the citizen as possible. Article 207 calls on the Council to allow greater access to documents when the Council is acting in its legislative capacity. A draft decision is currently before the Council to ensure that. Article 255 gives the public a general right to access EU documents, subject to certain principles of public and private interest. A draft regulation on access to documents of the Parliament, Council and Commission is before both the Parliament and Council to implement this imperative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access to all these documents, however, is insufficient unless there is informed consideration <Col N="1032" /> and debate of the issues. The work of the committee, both in terms of this report and in terms of its wider responsibilities, serves to inform and facilitate this debate and is, therefore, to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, later this month the Minister for Foreign Affairs will sign the Treaty of Nice on behalf of Ireland. The treaty is subject to ratification by each of the member states, a process all are committed to completing by the end of next year, thereby allowing the enlargement of the Union to proceed on schedule. In Ireland, the Government is actively considering the question of whether a referendum will be required to ratify the treaty. A decision will be made once the final text has been signed and in light of the relevant legal advice. Should a referendum prove to be necessary, the Government will have no hesitation in recommending a strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, confident that the public will support this latest stage of EU development as it has in three previous referenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The public will vote to approve to make the structural and procedural changes to the Union necessary to allow enlargement to take place. Enlargement is an historic necessity both for the countries of eastern and central Europe which, having made the painful transition to democracy, now deserve the economic development opportunities the Union can offer and for the existing member states for whom the strengthening of democratic stability in Europe and a radical extension of the single market will provide unparalleled benefits, both political and economic.</P>
      <P>The changes agreed in the Treaty of Nice will benefit the Union and its institutions as a whole, enabling it to continue to function efficiently and effectively post-enlargement, while safeguarding the position of individual states, such as Ireland. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have already outlined in detail both in the Oireachtas and elsewhere the content of the treaty. It was a good and necessary deal and one that reflected the degree of commitment shared by all the member states to resolving the difficult issues, including those left unresolved at Amsterdam, necessary for enlargement. Naturally in any negotiation, especially one involving up to 15 different interests, one cannot expect to get everything one wants. What is important is securing one's essential goals. We entered negotiations determined to ensure the maintenance of the overall institutional balance on which the Union is built including between large and small states, a balance which has made it so attractive to applicant states. In this we were successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Commission, we secured a move from a position where five member states have two Commissioners each to one where every member state will have one representative until, <Col N="1033" /> eventually, in a Union of 27 a reduced Commission will operate on the basis of strict equality between the member states. On re-weighting, as envisaged at Amsterdam, weights were adjusted to compensate those member states giving up their second Commissioner, while the requirement for the Council decision to have at least a majority of states in favour provides an important safeguard for the rights of smaller states.</P>
    <P>We favoured the extension of qualified majority voting, knowing that a greatly enlarged Council could not operate where national vetoes were widespread, and we were pleased to see movement on trade in services, Structural and Cohesion Funds and many other important areas. We were successful at the same time in resisting QMV where it might impinge on vital areas of national policy making, particularly taxation. We also managed to ensure that our allocation of seats in the European Parliament would not drop below 12 in a Union of 27, knowing that certain models under discussion would have only given us nine. These, along with changes to the rules governing enhanced co-operation where we insisted on maintaining safeguards for the overall coherence of the Union, were the main areas under discussion, but valuable, although less high profile reforms were agreed elsewhere; to the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Committee of the Regions and in other areas.</P>
    <P>In reviewing EU legislation, the joint committee's report reflects the increasing role in the EU legislative structure being played by the European Parliament. The Treaty of Nice enhances further this already significant role by extending the co-decision procedure to provisions dealing with anti-discrimination, free movement, asylum, judicial co-operation and other areas. The treaty also extends the areas of consultation with the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee. The committee's report constitutes a valuable review of EU legislation for 1999. I should also mention briefly what is on the EU agenda for the coming period, including proposals to increase the role for national Parliaments in the EU framework and for giving the public a greater involvement in the EU's activities. At Nice, it was decided to continue a consultation process on issues raised, but not decided, during last year's intergovernmental conference, in particular the division of competencies between national and EU authorities, the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the simplification of the EU treaties to make them more accessible to the public and, as mentioned, the role of national parliaments.</P>
    <P>The Swedish Presidency is expected to bring forward proposals to the Gothenburg European Council in June for structuring a wide public debate on these issues. This consultation process is expected to be lengthy and we in Ireland look forward to playing a full and active role in it, one that extends to all elements of civic society. The member states are agreed that for the European project to be considered successful, it is necessary <Col N="1034" /> for ordinary citizens to understand the nature of European co-operation and to identify with the structures, the institutions and the processes which are behind it.</P>
    <P>This wide debate will lead, in due course, to a further intergovernmental conference, possibly coinciding with Ireland's scheduled presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2004. Of course, that is a long way down the line, but the date indicates the significant amount of time considered necessary to discuss these important questions. In the meantime, our focus will be firmly on ratification of the Treaty of Nice. Most Members of the House will recognise the importance of ratification &ndash; for Ireland, for the Union, and for the applicant states &ndash; and will actively promote a positive vote should a referendum be required.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is healthy for our democracy and in particular for our relationship with the European Union that reports of the Joint Committee On European Affairs are debated in this House. Over the past 12 months we have discussed a number of important reports and I wholeheartedly welcome the scrutiny and attention the House is now paying to the work undertaken by the committee.</P>
      <P>This report demonstrates the broad range of directives that are transposed into Irish law. Table 3 of the report reveals the wide range of Departments across which EU directives impact. Directives range from the highly technical, such as the regulation advocating Community catch quotas in Greenland waters, to the highly relevant regulation regarding the labelling of beef and beef products. EU legislation has also provided EU wide policy in the international arena, for example, the ban on the supply to Indonesia of equipment which might be used for the internal repression or terrorism.</P>
      <P>I praised the work of the committee but I still feel there is a lack of cohesion between the work of the European institutions and the work of this House. I welcome the comments the Minister has made about strengthening our role in that regard. I thought that on the occasion the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, made a strong and passionate defence of his role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Nice, in a contest with Deputy Bruton, he gave a guarantee that we would have a referendum on that treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Our evolving membership of the European Union presents us with many new opportunities and many challenges. This report is informative rather than analytical. It provides raw material for legislators, policy makers and citizens about the scope of EU law, its transposition to Irish law and the progress which the Government is making. The report represents an important body of work, but I wish to put some analytical flesh on its bones.</P>
    <P>Last September the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, flew to Boston where she launched a broadside against the European Union. It was an impetuous, ill-thought out and badly argued analysis, although it was popular with many of her colleagues on the Government benches. I have no problem with a frank debate about the evolving nature of the EU, or Ireland's role within the Union. I would welcome a debate in this regard and I believe that the lack of debate and coverage of European affairs is a serious problem. However, the Minister, Deputy de Valera's contribution was of a different nature altogether. In tone and language, the speech she delivered would have had them rolling in the aisles at a Tory party conference. In a key passage the Minister said:</P>
    <P>We have found that the directives and regulations agreed in Brussels can often seriously impinge on our identity, culture and traditions.</P>
    <P>Actually, the Minister, Deputy de Valera, goes on these solo runs about once every five years, depending on the electoral situation in County Clare. However, she failed to provide one example or instance to back up her outlandish claim. It is highly ironic that the Minister chose to make her comments in Boston. Any casual review of the nightly TV listings &ndash; and television is one of the most important influences in modern culture &ndash; reveals that American culture is having the largest impact on what the Minister termed &ldquo;our identity, culture and traditions&rdquo;. For instance, on an Irish TV channel this evening, three hours of prime time viewing will feature wall-to-wall American programming, including such cultural highlights as &ldquo;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&rdquo;. In case that is not enough, viewers can tune into RTE later on to catch up on the latest drama in Hollywood, courtesy of &ldquo;Melrose Place&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In terms of cinema, television or music, which are key elements of modern culture, it is America, not Europe, which is having a dominant effect on culture in this island. Indeed, this is also the case in the rest of the European Union, if one looks at the efforts made by the French Government to try to protect what it sees, and what we would regard, as an intensely strong culture.</P>
    <P>The Minister's broadside received support from the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and during the autumn both Ministers were eager to launch a phoney war against the EU. Given this attitude <Col N="1036" /> around the Cabinet table, it is little wonder that our record in implementing legislation that Ireland has agreed to in Europe is so slow.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week we had the sad spectacle of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, defending his intense isolation &ndash; probably the most remarkable treatment of an Irish Minister by our European colleagues in the history of the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <P>I am happy to debate with the Minister. It is a debating Chamber. I agree with him. Obviously, at that particular meeting the Chair may have pulled a stroke by holding the debate about Ireland early on. Nonetheless, the overall result, as Deputy Mitchell said, was that the Minister for Finance was intensely isolated. It also raises questions about the performance of the Irish Commissioner, although I understand the constitutional role of the Commission. Mr. Byrne has won much kudos in his role on food safety but I do not think that particular recommendation should have come out of the European Commission. The Irish Minister was placed in a remarkably weak position and that issue should be examined.</P>
      <P>In an excellent article examining the Minister, Deputy de Valera's speech, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Garret FitzGerald, rightly highlighted the real basis for her frustration which lay in her non-implementation of the EU habitats directive. Unfortunately, that is not the only EU legislation which the Government has failed to implement fully and on time. For example, at present the European Commission is taking a legal case in the European Court of Justice over the Government's failure to implement the 1996 hazardous waste directive. It is also known as the Seveso Directive after an industrial accident near the Italian town of Seveso in 1976 when 600 animals died and nearly 1,300 people suffered chest and skin injuries as a result of the disaster. The directive is aimed at preventing major accidents involving dangerous substances. It is an important directive for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairperson of the Health and Safety Authority recently stated that there are still too few industry and trade bodies that proactively address health and safety. Recent events at the former Irish Steel plant in Cobh underline the necessity for comprehensive legislation in this area. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has failed to implement the legislation agreed in 1996, despite assurances given to the House in February 1999 that regulations to transpose the direc<Col N="1037" /> tive were &ldquo;currently at an advanced state of preparation&rdquo;. This is an intolerable situation. Unfortunately, it is not an isolated incident. Three years ago I introduced the Employment Rights Protection Bill, 1997, which intended to transpose certain EU directives into Irish law. They were Council Directive 75/129/EC of February 1975, imagine that, Council Directive 92/56/EC of June 1992 and Council Directive 77/187/EC of 14 February 1977. As far as I am aware, these directives have still not been transposed into Irish law. My Bill referred to undertakings when a company changes hands, to protect the rights of employees. As far as I am aware, however, these directives have still not been implemented in full.</P>
    <P>Over the Christmas break, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, kindly sent me two Statutory Instruments, No. 487 of 2000, which is the European Communities Safeguarding of Employees Rights and Transfer of Undertakings Regulations, and SI 488 of 200, which is the European Communities Protection of Employment Regulations. They went some way towards implementing the provisions of my Bill, which attempted to bring these four directives into Irish law. Yet, three and a half years after the Government took office, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, have wantonly refused either to help me have this Bill passed by the House in order to transpose these directives into law or to do so themselves. That is one spectacular example of where the Government has been extremely remiss in implementing directives which go back to within three or four years of our joining the EU in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>In advance of the last general election, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, proudly declared at her party conference that adopting silly directives made life difficult for the real heroes of the Irish economy, small business people, and that it was time we told the Brussels mandarins enough was enough. With this attitude residing at the very heart of Government, is it any wonder that our record in complying with and implementing what we have agreed at European level is so bad, as I think I have demonstrated in my own small attempts to legislate for these directives? The silly directives comment which the Tánaiste used to garner hollow applause at the Progressive Democrats conference, are usually important directives relating to employment law and social policy.</P>
    <P>Another case in point is the directive on parental leave. The half-hearted approach which this Government took in introducing the Parental Leave Act was such that Europe threatened to take us to the European Court of Justice. As a result, the Government was forced to amend the Act to cover the parents of all children born after June 1993 and not just the parents of children born after June 1996, as the Government had hoped. Unfortunately, the Government still refuses to introduce any paid element into our parental leave legislation which in reality confines the scope of the Act to the highest earners in our <Col N="1038" /> society. There is nothing new there, however, given this Government's abysmal record in relation to European legislation.</P>
    <P>The facts in this report are an important resource for legislators and citizens alike and I congratulate Deputy Durkan. The report should act as a wake-up call for our Government. Since coming into office it has shown a lethargic approach to the implementation of EU law. In the past 12 months, in particular, this half-hearted approach has been complemented with a jingoistic anti-European attack launched by senior Government members. It ill-behoves a nation which has gained so much from EU membership. As my party leader, Deputy Quinn, has often said, the Labour Party belongs to the joint largest party in the European Union. One of the problems with Fianna Fáil-led Governments is that the party belongs to a very small ragbag of uninfluential groups with semi-Fascists and other kinds of desperadoes from different countries in the European Union, so it is very difficult when we do not have&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy had a speaking slot and his spokesperson used a couple of minutes of it.</P>
      <P>I compliment the chairman and the staff who serviced the committee on producing an excellent report. It does not make for easy reading, as many people said. We dealt with 131 directives of one sort or another during the course of this report. Many of them belong in the area of agriculture and food production, some relate to external relations and others relate to fisheries and anti-dumping legislation. The area of agriculture and food is one in which we have had an impact on the public debate. The impact of the directives, as we state in our report, has been that a high proportion of those in agriculture implement improvements and standards and controls over animal and plants. Some of these are individual rather than minor adjustments but their cumulative effect is the improvement in the safety of food, albeit at a cost in terms of compliance by producers, enterprises, member states and Governments.</P>
      <P>I will select an example of some of the issues which came to our attention and which we tried to highlight. Members will be aware of the debate on the dioxins in the Belgian food products. Arising out of that, the committee to tried to get the competent authority in Ireland to respond to it and we got a very good response from Dr. Patrick Wall of the Food Safety Authority. He said the single market facilitates trade but also enables contaminated food products and ingredients to be rapidly dispersed and that for protection of both consumers and the food industry, efficient monitoring programmes for both chemical and microbial contamination combined with effective traceability system are essential if problems are to be identified rapidly and effective recalls are to be extended in a timely fashion. This dioxin episode highlights several questions for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I would like to think we took some of those ideas on board in relation to the BSE issue. Dr. Wall in his commentary said, among other things, that there is an urgent need to establish a national database to track the importation and distribution of raw materials for the food industry and that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is examining how to design such a database and plans to develop a food import tracking system by the end of this year. He went on to say that traceability of produce is vital and that importers and distributors of raw food or ingredients should keep accurate records as part of their food safety management system. He said that currently there is no laboratory in Ireland with the facility to analyse food for the presence of dioxins and that for consumer protection and safeguarding the Irish food industry, it is important that Ireland has such a facility. They are matters we should not ignore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also looked at the question of water quality. One of the matters which concerned the committee was the long lead in time for compliance with some of these directives. In relation to the <Col N="1040" /> directive on water quality, there is a lead in time of 16 years and it has been suggested that Ireland could support a tightening of the time scale for implementation. The proposal currently establishes a general time scale of 16 years which I think is far too long. Deputy Broughan adverted to issues going back to 1977. Unfortunately, in some cases, there have been extensions of up to six years giving a maximum implementation scale of 34 years for water quality improvements.</P>
    <P>The issue of genetically modified organisms preoccupied our discussions as did the directive, Television Without Frontiers. I suggest to Deputy Broughan and others that the thinking behind the Broadcasting Bill which is going through the Seanad is informed by the directive, Television Without Frontiers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan mentioned the East Timorese situation. The committee and the chairman took an active interest in the UN resolutions and the European Union's involvement in that. We also discussed national emissions standards along with data protection issues. It is fair to say that in these areas, as in many others, Ireland is implementing the directives at an acceptable rate. Some of them are extremely complicated and some are extremely difficult to deal with.</P>
    <P>Other issues were dealt with and I compliment the chairman on the input he has made at COSAC level in giving COSAC a real voice in formulating EU policy. I agree that little enough attention is paid to EU legislation in this House and in the Upper House and how it affects our lives. I was delighted to hear the Minister say it is the Government's policy to improve that situation. The Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms occupied a great deal of the time of the committee as well. That will be transposed into the Treaty of Nice and I have no doubt we will have a referendum on the ratification of that. I hope the three main parties here do not all end up supporting a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote and having our hands tied behind our backs, which may well be the case.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the former Clerk of the committee, Micheál O'Corcora, who has left the committee for a promotion, and also the staff of Departments who have been very willing to supply us with additional material to flesh out opinions contained in those directives. I am glad to have had the opportunity to support this report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which will have a huge impact for every young person who is either building or buying a new house. It relates to the HomeBond guarantee scheme. HomeBond is supposed to provide a type of insurance to buildings which in turn covers their clients when either an inferior job is done or where a builder <Col N="1041" /> goes bankrupt during the construction period. The scheme is broadly similar to that which tour operators have in the tourism industry. However, the experience of one young lady in my constituency in East Galway, who decided to build a new house, should be a lesson to many others. This lady paid the builder several financial instalments once the house had commenced. When the builder notified her that he was covered under the HomeBond guarantee scheme she was much relieved. However, it transpired that when the builder had been paid about £35,000 more than the value of the work done at that stage, seemingly, he went broke and disappeared.</P>
      <P>The house owner understood that once this small builder got the so-called seal of approval from HomeBond she was working with what she thought was a safe builder. It appears that the HomeBond guarantee scheme works at two levels. One aspect of the scheme is to guarantee stage payments at certain points of construction, that is, 15 per cent of cost at foundation and 35 per cent at roof level.</P>
      <P>This builder was accepted by HomeBond for the first instalment but because the builder did not apply to HomeBond for what is called a HB 11 application, HomeBond believes it has no responsibility whatever in this matter so that this lady is left high and dry.</P>
      <P>This young house owner genuinely believed that any builder accepted by HomeBond would be reputable. She questions the vetting procedure and how the builder could go broke so quickly after his acceptance into the scheme. There are genuine structural defects in the house and she believes the HomeBond should be in a position to help her.</P>
      <P>This episode will bring home to many young potential house builders and buyers that the guarantee given by HomeBond is quite restrictive and that they should certainly consider having an independent engineer on the site so far as possible in relation to the inspection for structural defects. This house owner is considering going to arbitration. However, for the house builder this is not as attractive a proposition as one might think. It could cost between £2,000 and £2,500 to get the type of legal representation needed to go to arbitration and if she loses she will be worse off than ever.</P>
      <P>So far as the vetting of builders is concerned the financial questionnaire is a most elaborate document. It ask all types of questions on the financial standing of the builder involved. I find it difficult to understand if they go to the lengths outlined in this document, that a builder who would meet those requirements could go broke a couple of months later. That baffles me and my constituent. It is only right that the public would know exactly what is going on. I await the Minister of State's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and <Col N="1042" /> Local Government, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this issue.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly committed to ensuring both that aspiring first time house purchasers are given every opportunity to buy a house, and that there is adequate protection afforded to first time purchasers, and to all purchasers of new houses to ensure that developers and builders maintain the highest standards of work and that regulations on building standards are met.</P>
      <P>The need for financial protection for new house purchasers is required particularly in instances where stage payments are paid to a builder. This practice requires the purchaser to make payments to builders at intervals in respect of the construction of a property. Stage payments are considered to be an unfair practice which exposes the house purchaser to an unacceptable degree of risk, by transferring the building cost of construction, and the development risk, from the developer to the purchaser. Should the builder go out of business before the House is completed, there can be considerable financial difficulties for the purchaser.</P>
      <P>A limited stage payments warranty is currently provided by HomeBond, the National House Building Guarantee Scheme Company, which protects purchasers of new houses in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation of a HomeBond registered builder. While it is acknowledged that the protection afforded by the HomeBond stage payments warranty is insufficient as liability is limited, it would not be feasible to overcome this inadequacy by simply increasing the level of cover provided, as the extra costs incurred by a builder would ultimately be passed on to the purchaser. There is no protection for people who have houses built by builders who are not members of HomeBond.</P>
      <P>A number of issues relating to consumer protection for house purchasers are currently being considered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for inclusion in a draft Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is being prepared by his Department. Among the issues being addressed are proposals to limit the practice of stage payments to ensure that the rights of house purchasers are safeguarded while avoiding adverse implications for overall housing supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreements between builders and purchasers regarding construction contracts, including completion of &ldquo;snag lists&rdquo;, are governed by the rules of private contract between both parties. Therefore, builders who do not meet the requirements set out in the contract may be sued for breach of contract. As these are private contracts, third party intervention would not be appropriate. However, what the Government can do is ensure that these contracts are fair to all parties. I understand the Director of Consumer Affairs is preparing to bring a court case under EU unfair terms in consumer contracts regulations to outlaw certain terms in builders' contracts deemed to be <Col N="1043" /> inherently unfair. Such clauses would include those where builders insert into the standard building contract, a &ldquo;get-out&rdquo; clause to avoid finishing houses and completing snag lists. I understand the case is due to be heard shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition to their current ten-year warranty for structural defects to new properties constructed by registered builders, HomeBond introduced last November a new complaints assessment scheme for registered builders, in respect of non-structural defects in new houses, arising within a year of completion of the purchase with effect from 1 January 2001. Non-structural defects covered under the scheme include leaky plumbing, uneven flooring, breaches of fire requirements such as smoke alarms, and lack of insulation. If a HomeBond member fails to comply with a direction notified by HomeBond, HomeBond may invoke sanctions against its member, including a refusal to register dwellings and possibly suspension or termination of membership.</P>

      <P>While the Department of the Environment and Local Government has overall responsibility for building regulations, which set out the legal requirements for design and construction, each local authority's building control officer is empowered to ensure that general building standards are observed by builders. These officers can undertake inspections and, if they consider that the work carried out is sub-standard, they can institute legal proceedings against non-compliant builders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter in view of all the different tragedies that have taken place at many black spots throughout the country even since Christmas. The issue I wish to deal with is the accident black spot at Slane Bridge, County Meath, on the N2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my sympathy with the Garvey family on the tragic death of their son, David, whose second birthday is today and wish his parents, Cathal and Joan, a speedy recovery. The problem at Slane Bridge has been on-going for many years with one tragedy after another. This week's tragic death of little David Garvey has galvanised the local people into demanding immediate action from our politicians. As one of those politicians I make no apology for raising this issue even though I was criticised by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government this morning on local radio. Some 22 people have died at this black spot. Traffic lights were erected there about 14 years ago. It is unbelievable that a greater number of deaths has occurred since the erection of those lights. I asked three days ago <Col N="1044" /> for the lights to be turned off but I was told by the officials that it was a big decision to make and that they would have to discuss the matter further. Those who use that road and stop at the lights, as I did last Saturday in the course of my ordinary constituency duties, take their lives into their hands waiting at the bottom of the hill. They hope it will not happen to them, that they will not be in the wrong place at the wrong time as happened to the Garvey family last Saturday morning.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was asked yesterday to discuss the matter with me on local radio this morning he refused to do so. I am an elected member for the same constituency and it is unfair that the Minister would consider that I or any other Member would want to use the issue as a political football. As a politician and elected Member for the past 20 years I have a duty to raise matters such as this. It is not easy to do so because of the NRA rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us today that £640 million is to be spent between now and the next three years on different roads but only £60,000 is to be spent in Slane which is the biggest single area of the county for disasters. More tragedies are waiting to happen.</P>
    <P>The following suggestions were made at a public meeting which I attended in Slane last Tuesday night at which over 400 people were present: first, to remove the traffic lights immediately; second, to provide a sand bed all the way down on the left side of the road so that in the event of lorries getting into difficulty there will be some place for them to go; third, to remove the footpath on same side of the road and put it on the other side; fourth, to purchase the timber yard at the bottom of the hill so that in the event of a runaway lorry there will be a <i>cul-de-sac</i> and the lorry will not have to try to negotiate the bridge if it is out of control &ndash; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would use that part of the road more often than I; fifth, to provide a camera on the Collon side of the town with a film in it so that heavy vehicles travelling at more than 20 miles per hour at that point can be fined heavily, say £500; sixth, the NRA to put in place a long-term programme for the building of a new bridge; seventh, the plans that were discussed in the mid-1990s should be taken off the shelf and the Minister should direct the NRA to ensure progress is made on building a bridge for the future; eight, the removal of the restrictive order on the bridge so that immediate improvements can be made at both ends and, ninth, to provide money for a walkway for pedestrians at the back of the bridge as has been made on the Liffey. Many tourists visit that area of County Meath and if there were such a walkway pedestrians could walk freely at the back of the bridge at one side or the other.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Mr. Michael Tobin of the NRA, with whom I spoke yesterday morning and who agreed to meet the county engineer, representatives of the new committee that was formed to protect the people who use this bridge at <Col N="1045" /> this blackspot, and local politicians, will agree to many of the suggestions made. I welcome the fact that the Minister said on radio this morning: &ldquo;I am pleased to state that money will not be an object&rdquo;. This matter must be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not present to deal with this issue. He knows I have been trying to raise it for the past few days. The area is in his constituency and I am sure he is, as I am, concerned for those who use this road every day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Farrelly for raising this important matter. It gives me an opportunity to restate, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, the Government's commitment to achieving tangible improvements in road safety terms.</P>
      <P>The Government is now at the mid-point of implementing its strategy for road safety 1998-2002. This was the first national road safety strategy to be formulated by an Irish Government. It specified demanding and quantified targets on road safety. The Government and the road safety agencies now hold themselves accountable in relation to these targets.</P>
      <P>One of the interim targets fixed by the strategy was to complete specific accident reduction measures at 240 locations on the national road network. Progress is ahead of target in this area with 268 schemes completed at the end of 2000 and a further 88 approved. Low cost safety improvement works on non-national roads were introduced for the first time last year. This was an extension of the scheme operated for the past few years on national roads under the auspices of the National Roads Authority. Expenditure in 2000 was £0.525 million. Some 55 locations on non-national roads were approved for funding in 2000. The 2001 allocations provide £1.8 million for similar works this year in what will be a much more extensive programme.</P>
      <P>Within the framework of the Government strategy real and worthwhile gains have been made in road safety. Road deaths decreased by 57, or nearly 13% between 1997 and 2000 relative to the strategy target of 20% minimum reduction by end 2002. Serious injuries decreased in the period 1997-99 by over 15% relative to a similar reduction target by end 2002. The road toll in 2000 showed a small percentage increase over 1999. This outcome challenges us because all road accidents must be regarded as preventable and all avoidable loss of life is tragic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has ensured that a range of existing and new measures have been deployed to support road safety improvements. Garda enforcements have been intensified regarding speeding, drinking and seatbelt wearing, fixed automated speed cameras and evidential breath testing have been introduced and are being further extended in support of this process. Research into the involvement of young people in road accidents and the problem <Col N="1046" /> of drugs and driving is being advanced and education and information on road safety is being improved, including joint promotion of campaigns with the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    <P>By reference to the estimates set out in the road safety strategy in 1998, over 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998. Work is also under way in the development of a penalty points system to track infringements of driving regulations with a view to improving the driving behaviour of those who recurringly commit these breaches. The development of a penalty points system will involve complex legal and organisational arrangements. The drafting of the Road Traffic Bill, which will provide for the introduction of penalty points, by the Chief Parliamentary Counsel is now proceeding as a matter of urgency with a view to its publication very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly referred to this week's tragic accident at Slane Bridge. I join with him in extending my sympathy to the family on their enormous loss. Everyone was horrified at the extent of the carnage. The family deserves our condolences and best wishes in trying to come to terms with their huge loss. This location has seen other serious accidents in the past involving heavy goods vehicles. As the Deputy is aware, the National Roads Authority is responsible for the planning, co-ordination and financing of improvements to the national road network. I understand that traffic calming measures are already being planned between the NRA and Meath County Council to enhance the safety of Slane Bridge. These should be capable of early implementation.</P>
    <P>The Ministers do not have direct responsibility for deciding the nature of improvement works, whether short or longer term, on the national road network. However, I am certain that the NRA will be receptive to concerns about road safety expressed by public representatives, residents and road users and that it will ensure appropriate responses are made to situations of high road safety risk.</P>
    <P>There is a collective responsibility on all agencies involved in road safety to do their best to achieve the targets set out in the strategy. Given the tragedies that occurred in recent days, this represents a real challenge. Of course, the achievement of the targets is also dependent on the general public taking collective responsibility for their driving behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State in whose constituency Ringsend and Pearse Street are located. He has responsibility for this matter and will not be unaware of what I am about to say. The city development board of Dublin Corporation, which is comprised of Government Departments, the social partners at Dublin City Hall, the six special policy commission chairpersons and the Lord Mayor as well as community <Col N="1047" /> representatives, is a broadly based organisation. They wrote to the principal officer, social policy unit, Department of the Taoiseach, in respect of the areas that were to be included in RAPID. I will read the text of that letter and to ask the Minister of State if it is possible at this late stage to include Ringsend, an area he and I know very well, in the area that has been extracted from the south inner city, that is, the Pearse Street area, and to have those two areas linked together for the purposes of this programme. The letter reads as follows: </P>
      <P>We live in a time of unprecedented prosperity and progress and in a city that is in many ways booming. Yet we know that for many of our citizens poverty and social deprivation still exists. For this reason this city needs to tackle social and economic deprivation, to address social inclusion and to offer hope to communities still afflicted, in the midst of good times, with the spectre of poverty and social disadvantage, to the benefit of all our citizens and our citywide economy.</P>
      <P>We recognize and applaud the work and commitment of communities and action groups that continue to seek to improve the reality of daily life for people in these communities, in this our city.</P>
      <P>The Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness have stated their intention to target resources and funding into 25 of the most disadvantaged communities in the nation. This targeting will involve agencies of the state and communities collaborating to maximize the impact they can make on the causes and manifestation of poverty and disadvantage within these areas. As the Development Board for the City it is our wish to see the greater integration of resources and their application to the areas of greatest need. This must happen in partnership and must seek to avail of the knowledge and experience of local voluntary, community and business groups who are committed to tackling needs within these communities. It must build upon the work already begun through the Drugs Task Forces, Integrated Area Plans, and Area Partnerships. The task of ensuring better ways to eliminate poverty and social disadvantage is best achieved by co-operation and integration of all those working to the common good.</P>
      <P>Dublin City Development Board, conscious that Government must now identify the 25 targeted areas referred to in Section 3.6 of the PPF, declares that the objective evidence of the concentration of disadvantage and social deprivation requires that government include the following areas of Dublin city;</P>
      <P>North Inner City</P>
      <P>Finglas</P>
      <P>Ballymun</P>
      <P>South Inner City</P>

    <P>Ballybough</P>
    <P>Darndale/Priorswood</P>
    <P>Stoneybatter</P>
    <P>Further details on the basis of selection of these areas are contained in an appendix to the letter I have quoted. The letter continues:</P>
    <P>The City Development Board requests the Interdepartmental Committee to include these areas on the basis of need in the list of the 25 areas to be targeted.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State address the recommendation in the letter which calls for the inclusion of the south inner city areas? The area ultimately selected, the Pearse Street area, is a much narrower definition of that. The Pearse Street area is contained within the area of operation of the Dublin Docklands Development Board, as is Ringsend. While Ringsend may under some criteria not have the same level of deprivation as that of the Pearse Street area, nevertheless, deprivation still exists in accordance with the criteria laid down. To avoid a division between the two communities who qualify for consideration under the Dublin Docklands development area, on the one hand, and in some other respects, it would be socially cohesive and effective to have Ringsend linked to the Pearse Street area for the purposes of the application of the RAPID programme, which the Labour Party welcomes.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for affording me the opportunity to clarify the selection process used to identify the 25 most disadvantaged urban areas to be targeted under the new RAPID programme. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the RAPID programme was launched by the Taoiseach and me last Thursday, 8 February 2001. RAPID stands for Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development. This programme fulfils a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to identify the 25 most disadvantaged areas in the country and develop a focus across the social inclusion measures in the national development plan and target that investment at the identified areas.</P>
      <P>The 25 most disadvantaged areas in the State were identified using objective criteria which were agreed with the social partners. These criteria were the Trutz Haase deprivation index supported by data relating to the location of significant rented local authority housing and schools designated as disadvantaged by the Department of Education and Science.</P>

    <P>The Trutz Haase index of relative affluence and deprivation was first developed to facilitate the designation of areas of disadvantage in preparation for the operational programme for local, <Col N="1049" /> urban and rural development and the establishment of area based partnership companies. The original index was updated using the latest available information from the 1996 Census of Population. The index identifies the relative level of deprivation in communities based on the census information. The geographical unit used is the district electoral division, which breaks down counties into manageable and coherent areas. The Haase index deliberately includes variables beyond measures of material deprivation which capture some of the structural weaknesses within local communities. The index is considered a reliable indicator of relative levels of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The 11 census variables used in the index are (1) the percentage of the population in the unskilled manual class; (2) the percentage of the population in the professional classes; (3) the percentage of the adult population leaving school at 15 years or below; (4) the percentage of the adult population leaving school at 20 years or above; (5) the percentage of adult population with no or primary education only; (6) the percentage of adult population with third level education; (7) unemployment rate; (8) proportion of long-term unemployed in the labour force; (9) proportion of lone parents; (10) the percentage of those at work engaged in small farming and (11) age dependency rate. Those which were categorised as the most deprived 5% of all DEDs were selected for the RAPID programme. The Ringsend area is not within the 5% most disadvantaged areas in the country.</P>
    <P>The list of areas obtained through this exercise was examined in relation to the locations of significant rented local authority housing. Significant local authority housing schemes in which at least 75% of houses were rented were added where not already included. Data on schools designated as disadvantaged by the Department of Education and Science was used to confirm that the most deprived urban areas had been identified by the selection process.</P>
    <P>Population size of the areas selected range around an average of 9,000. The selection process is fully objective and stands up to all scrutiny. I know the Ringsend area very well and, like Deputy Quinn, I represent the area. I would like it to be included but, unfortunately, it did not meet the criteria set down, which is the 5% worst and most deprived communities in the country. I gather that if we were to link Pearse Street and Ringsend we would not have been able to include either of them. We had a choice. It was a difficult decision because obviously one wishes to look after one's constituents. However, I have been told on many occasions that the area does not fit into the 5% category. Some of the communities included communities from St. Theresa's Gardens, Fatima Mansions and so on, which received a great deal of fame recently, are suffering from severe social neglect over many years. I am pleased Deputy Quinn welcomes the programme. If we all work together, it can make a significant <Col N="1050" /> impact in helping communities to have the same choices and opportunities as everyone else.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has raised the issue, I will again seek to have the area included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for coming to the House and I hope he will have some good news for County Wexford. Wexford seems like an island at present in relation to natural gas supply in that it is surrounded by counties that already have the gas supply such as Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Wicklow. We have no problem with this because it is good that the natural gas grid is extended to these counties. When I drive up and down the road every day of the week I see the pipes being extended to Arklow, which is a good development in view of Arklow's past unemployment problems.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain why natural gas has not been extended to County Wexford? The figures speak for themselves. The unemployment rate in the county is 8% to 9% at a time when the national rate is 3% to 4%. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment established a task force last year to deal with the county's serious unemployment problem. One of its main recommendations was that natural gas should be extended to Wexford to help to entice industry to the county. There has been no response from Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
      <P>It is important the Minister of State recognises the serious problems in the county. There is a perception that Wexford is a booming county. However, in a report published this week Mr. Peter Bacon &ndash; the Government has acted on previous reports by him &ndash; states:</P>
      <P>The structure of County Wexford's economy is posing many challenges. In overall terms the county has not fared well in attracting high technology industries. Indeed, the industrial structure is characterised by many traditional sectoral enterprises with low productivity and low value added.</P>
      <P>The agriculture sector faces serious adjustment problems and the scope for related sector economic growth is very limited. Tourism has been sluggish and because of its overall economic structure disposable income levels in County Wexford are among the lowest in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will see that we have major difficulty in County Wexford in dealing with the unemployment problems and with the present industries. In the last three years, despite the Celtic tiger and the announcements of thousands of jobs around the country, there has been no decent jobs announcement for the county. That speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the gas network be extended to County Wexford. A number of inquires have been made by the IDA, FÁS and <Col N="1051" /> the county development board. Many industrialists are asking why there is no natural gas network in the county and what are the future plans in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this with the Minister of State on a number of occasions. It is important County Wexford ends its isolation and that the Minister of State considers extending the network spurs to the county. Given that the network has been extended to Arklow it can be further extended to Gorey. It can also be extended from Carlow <i>via</i> Enniscorthy to Wexford and from Waterford/Kilkenny to New Ross. There are a number of options for BGE to consider. I ask the Minister of State to use his skills to ensure that the natural gas grid will be extended to County Wexford as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Browne for raising this important matter on behalf of his constituents. I wish to make it clear that I have no function in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy. The question of which individual towns will be connected to the natural gas network is a matter in the first instance for pipeline developers, be it Bord Gáis Éireann or private sector developers.</P>
      <P>Where a developer has decided on a pipeline route and which areas and towns are to be serviced, the proposal is submitted to my Department for regulatory approval under the Gas Acts. In addition, in the case of proposals by BGE, I must also give approval for the expenditure involved in my capacity as shareholder. In approving pipeline proposals I can attach conditions in relation to safety and environmental considerations. However, I must emphasise that I cannot determine what towns along its route are to be served by spur lines. This is a matter for the pipeline developers and will be made by them on the basis of commercial criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> However, I can update Deputy Browne with regard to the work undertaken to date. BGE is committed to extending the natural gas network to as many areas as possible, provided this can be done in line with its commercial mandate under the Gas Acts. BGE has informed me that the latest future transmission plans show the necessity to construct a transmission main from the Cork-Dublin pipeline to an above ground installation at a central point in County Wexford. Technically this could make way for supplying gas to the largest towns, that is, Wexford, Enniscorthy and New Ross. However, I must emphasise that construction of the required transmission and distribution mains would be dependent on the project being economically viable and is a matter for the company.</P>
    <P>A detailed study and preliminary distribution design of Wexford town was completed by BGE in 1996, but at the time it was established there was insufficient load to justify a transmission extension. I understand that the prospect of extensions to the natural gas grid is under active review by BGE as part of a national study to determine centres that can be supplied with gas on an economic basis. The question of gas supplies to towns in the Wexford catchment area is a matter for BGE to examine in assessing the economics of extending the transmission and distribution networks. When this assessment has been completed BGE will have a fuller picture as to the viability of such extensions. I have asked the board to let me have detailed analysis of these options as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate Deputy Browne's deep interest in this matter, which he has constantly raised with me. I also understand his desire to secure the extension of the natural gas network for his constituency. I trust that the outcome of the BGE exercise will be positive as far as extending natural gas to County Wexford is concerned.</P>

      <P>The production of pet food is covered by a number of EU and national legislative instruments. The basic rules governing the operation of the industry are set down in the European Communities (Disposal, Processing and Placing on the Market of Animal By-products) Regulations, 1994, SI 257 of 1994). Under this legislation, which transposes the relevant EU Council directive into Irish law, there is no legal impediment to the incorporation of meat and bonemeal into pet food. The recent temporary EU ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal permits the feeding of such protein to pets. In Ireland, the use of meat and bonemeal in the manufacture of pet food is subject to a licensing system. There are no such licenses in operation at present.</P>

      <P>Under the protocol on direct payments to farmers there are commitments to pay arable aid and other area based payments to farmers by specified deadlines for the different schemes. There is also a commitment to notify farmers of problems with their area aid applications by the end of September. My Department is conscious of the need to adhere to these deadlines. At the same time the move from a headage to an area-based compensatory allowance payments system for farmers in less favoured areas will result in an additional administrative workload in the area aid unit. In these circumstances in order to continue to meet the various commitments it is necessary to bring forward the closing date for receipt of area aid applications to 30 March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that area aid application closing dates at the end of March have been applied in some past years with no apparent difficulties for farmers. I intend to ensure the widest <Col N="1054" /> publicity for the new closing date when application forms are being sent out and in the run up to the end of March so that all farmers are fully aware of the requirements. There will be no extension to the closing date this year and normal regulatory provisions will apply to late applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Harmonised rules adopted at EU level govern the veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable to intra-community trade in live animals. These rules require a range of checks to be carried out and also provide for the imposition of restrictions on, or the banning of, intra-community trade when this is considered necessary for the protection of public health. An example of such a measure is the Commission decision banning the export of bovine animals from the United Kingdom, which remains in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no test currently available to detect the presence of BSE in a live bovine animal, but all animals consigned for intra-community trade are subjected to a clinical examination within 24 hours of departure to ensure that they are free from disease symptoms. Where a positive animal has been identified in a herd, the authorities in the member state of origin are obliged to take restrictive measures in relation to BSE. As the Deputy is aware a herd slaughter-out programme is in place in Ireland since 1989, and this is also the case in most other member states, thereby ensuring that animals from a known BSE infected herd cannot be traded. To date in Ireland, there <Col N="1056" /> have been 604 cases of BSE in 596 herds. Of the 604 cases, 15 were imported animals.</P>
    <P>The framework of veterinary checks provided for by harmonised EU rules, the implementation of those rules by my Department and the veterinary services of other member states, together with the constant programme of monitoring and review of public health risk under the aegis of the standing veterinary committee are intended to ensure that animals imported from other member states do not pose risks to the country of destination. However, I must remind the Deputy that the Single Market provides both opportunities and potential risks to Irish farmers. The opportunities involve unhindered access to EU markets, the potential risk includes the possibility of introducing other diseases into Ireland following relaxation of our import controls in 1992.</P>

      <P>I am aware that recent developments in the beef sector have given rise to job losses in the industry. The purchase for destruction scheme which was introduced at EU level as a response to a loss of commercial outlets has, given the nature of the scheme, given rise to job losses in boning and cutting plants. I had a meeting recently with SIPTU on the issue and I have agreed to set up a joint liaison committee of officials of my Department and SIPTU to examine the situation.</P>
      <P>The most effective long-term solution to this problem is, of course, to maximise sales on the commercial market. Measures taken at EU level to ensure greater protection for the consumer should help to restore confidence in beef and, thereby, bring about a recovery in the market. Clearly, this process will take some time and, in the meantime, market support measures such as the purchase for destruction scheme will continue to be needed to support the producer prices. Nevertheless, it remains my objective that the maximum amount of beef continues to be sold on the available commercial market outlets.</P>

      <P>In view of recent developments at EU level, it is likely that in future there will be greater commercial demand for cattle slaughtered below 30 months. While the finishing of cattle is primarily a matter for the industry itself, my Department has asked Teagasc to prepare guidelines for farmers on the feeding and management strategies needed to facilitate the finishing of cattle before they reach 30 months of age. I understand that Teagasc has now circulated a briefing document to its livestock advisers around the country. Teagasc has also prepared leaflets for farmers on this issue and will hold a series of public demonstrations in the near future on appropriate feeding and breeding practices for cattle from the suckler cow herd.</P>
      <P>While it is the case that steers from the suckler herd will have the greatest difficulty in reaching the finishing stage by 30 months of age, Teagasc research shows that it is quite possible. Producers who wish to finish these cattle early will have to pay greater attention to good husbandry practices generally, including animal health, good performance at grass, silage quality and the feeding of concentrates where good quality silage is not available.</P>

      <P>The protocol on direct payments to farmers, agreed between my Department and the social partner farm organisations, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, sets out agreed payment and delivery targets in relation to the wide range of direct payments to farmers and clarifies how the schemes are administered.</P>
      <P>Progress on the implementation of the protocol is monitored by a monitoring and review committee, which comprises representatives of the social partner farm organisations and my Department, under an independent chairman. Feedback from the first committee meeting, held on 14 December last, indicated that the Department was well on target in meeting its commitments and in some cases exceeding them. This underlines the commitment of my Department to ensuring the best possible service to its clients.</P>
      <P>During 2000, my Department issued some 1.6 million cheques valued at more than £797 million to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes, of which in excess of £490 million related to payments made under the 2000 schemes. In excess of a total of £578 million has been paid under the 2000 schemes to date. I am delighted to say that the commencement dates for both advance and balancing payments, as set down under the protocol, were on target and indeed ahead of target in some instances for the 2000 headage and premia schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 16 October last, the earliest date allowed under EU rules for the making of payments, over £152 million has been paid under the suckler cow premium scheme, while in excess of £142 million has been paid to special beef premium applicants who have completed their retention periods. Bal<Col N="1059" /> ancing payments under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme commenced one week earlier than under the 1999 scheme and balancing payments under the 2000 special beef premium scheme commenced more than two months earlier than under the 1999 scheme. Balancing payments under the new slaughter premium scheme cannot commence until the quota usage for 2000 is determined.</P>
    <P>While no targets were agreed in the protocol in respect of the compensatory allowances, payments under the headage schemes commenced on 8 September 2000 and almost £111 million has been paid out under these schemes to date. Specific payment targets for the new area based compensatory allowance scheme are expected to be agreed with farming bodies at the next protocol review meeting.</P>
    <P>Turning to the 2000 ewe premium scheme, payment of both first and second instalments commenced on target with all eligible applicants being paid within a few days. It is expected that the final instalment will be paid in February 2001 following publication of the regulation setting the rate.</P>
    <P>Under the 2000 arable aid scheme, payments commenced on 16 November as agreed at EU level and, under the protocol, 96% of payments were made on that date. Indeed, 99% of all applicants were paid by 31 December 2000 and over £92 million has now been paid under this scheme. With regard to the 2000 extensification premium, full payments will be made in June 2001.</P>
    <P>The new REPS and early retirement schemes were opened to new applications on 27 November 2000. The periods set down in the protocol for approval for payment have not elapsed in respect of any applications. As regards the new on-farm investment schemes and the installation aid scheme, the protocol applies from the commencement date of these schemes on 1 February and 15 February respectively. Arrangements are being put in place to monitor compliance with the protocol.</P>
    <P>The foregoing indicates that a high standard of delivery has been achieved and compares more than favourably with other EU member states. I would hope that further improvement can be achieved and this can be helped in no small part by applicants responding quickly to queries and correspondence.</P>

      <P>The area-based compensatory allowances scheme agreed with the Irish Farmers Association in July 2000 and since <Col N="1060" /> approved by the European Commission provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped &ndash; lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped &ndash; lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; and mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The Government has committed some £360 million additional funding for the scheme over the period 2001-06. The new arrangements involve a cost of £180 million this year representing an increase of about £60 million over the headage type scheme. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 under the old system to 109,000 this year. Some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 farmers will incur some losses. I have, however, negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good this year, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements, the average loss this year will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
      <P>My officials are carrying out a review of the scheme to see if an equitable long-term solution can be found to the problem of reduced payments particularly in mountain type areas.</P>

      <P>The directives in question are the subject of national rules under the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Orders, 1995 and 1997. Inspectors of my Department monitor compliance with the rules in so far as they relate to international transport and findings are communicated to the Commission of the European Communities. The Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission also conducts inspections in relation to animal welfare, including transport, in the member states of the Community, including Ireland. So far as domestic transport is concerned, I have asked my Department to undertake as soon as practicable a campaign of vehicle inspection to ensure that internal transporters are fully aware of the rules and to deal with infringements appropriately where identified. Arrangements to transpose into national law the animal transport provisions of Directive 64/432/EEC as set out in Council Directive 97/12/EC are at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>In addition to enforcement of the directives, prosecutions have been taken against animal transporters under the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, by the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current BSE scare has resulted in a substantial fall in beef consumption in many member states in the European Union, particularly in the bigger member states such as Germany and Italy. The decline in beef consumption has significantly reduced the market for beef generally, with the result that cattle prices have fallen significantly in some of these member states and Irish exporters are meeting severe price competition on the EU market from cheap German beef. In this situation, the focus of the industry and Bord Bia, the State agency responsible for the promotion of beef, has been to retain as many markets as possible rather than in the short-term in order to secure a greater share of the EU market for Irish beef.</P>
      <P>My strategy has been to ensure that measures are put in place at EU level to provide greater protection for the consumer and to bring about increased beef consumption by restoring consumer confidence in beef. I am satisfied that the various measures relating to the introduction of rapid BSE testing for over 30 month cattle and the extension of the SRM list are helpful in this regard. I am also making every effort to ensure the appropriate EU support resources are in place and applied across the EU to deal with the surplus of beef on the EU market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> In view of the nature of the activity involved much of which is part of the ongoing activity of my Department and Bord Bia, it is not possible to quantify the cost of these activities.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Since March 1996, the exportation of live bovines from the UK has been banned, Commission decision of 27 March 1996 &ndash; 96/239/EEC &ndash; refers.</P>
      <P>A very extensive range of measures is now in place to ensure the integrity of the national herd as well as cattle presented for slaughter. These include an animal traceability system and close liaison is maintained between my Department, the Garda authorities and Customs and Excise to ensure that the ban is implemented as far as imports from Northern Ireland are concerned. It should be noted that the primary onus is on the UK authorities to comply with the implementation of the ban.</P>
      <P>As regards slaughtering plants, strict procedures are in place to verify both the origin and health status of animals presented for slaughter. These include checks of ear tags and documentation &ndash; including checks against the CMMS database &ndash; and<i> ante mortem</i> inspections. Checks are also undertaken at other locations on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Since 1996, 2,097 animals in 350 consignments have been seized on suspicion that they were illegally imported. Some 455 animals from 36 consignments were released after further investigation. The seizures were made at a variety of locations including at slaughter plants, on farms and on roads. In addition, my Department has detained other cattle whose identity could not be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where my Department is not satisfied as to the origin or identification of animals, they are detained pending investigation. Where the origin and-or identification cannot be verified, the ani<Col N="1063" /> mals will be destroyed without compensation being payable. Where sufficient evidence is available, prosecutions will be taken and to date three convictions have been secured in connection with offences uncovered. There are also a number of cases with the Director of Public Prosecutions and a number of others are under investigation. The control measures are strictly enforced and there is no evidence to suggest that smuggled cattle are a significant source of BSE here.</P>

      <P>Last year, the European Union adopted regulations to introduce compulsory labelling of beef at all stages of production and marketing up to and including the final point of sale to the consumer. The regulations in question are European Parliament and Council Regulation No. 1760/2000 of 17 July 2000 which, establishes a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and the labelling of beef and beef products; and Commission Regulation No. 1825/2000 of 25 August 2000, which lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation 1760/2000.</P>
      <P>Under these regulations, operators or organisations involved in the production and marketing of beef are, since 1 September 2000, required to label it with the following information: a reference number or code which enables the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located; and the approval number of the de-boning hall and member state or third country in which it is located.</P>
      <P>These regulations, which are fully enforced in Ireland, have direct legal effect in all member states of the European Union, which are also required to enforce them in full.</P>

      <P>Research and development in the beef industry is the responsibility of Teagasc, the universities and the industry itself.</P>
      <P>As far as Teagasc is concerned, the key objective of the research and development programme is the production of high quality healthy beef in a consumer friendly manner. Current activity includes research into producing consistently tender beef and how to produce lean beef with less fat content in the meat and with a fatty acid profile more compatible with current human dietary recommendations. Research is also being undertaken into the positive influence of grass on the concentration of the anti-carcinogenic conjugated linoleic acid in beef. On the food safety side, Teagasc has carried out work on the development and implementation of a HACCP system which is designed to ensure the processing of beef in meat plants takes place in accordance with the highest veterinary standards.</P>
      <P>The ultimate objective of all this research is to produce a product which is not only safe to eat but in fact makes a positive contribution to a healthy diet and is in line with the demands of consumers in the various markets we aim to develop. It is hoped that the result of the beef research and development programme will support efforts to increase consumption of beef on the home and export markets.</P>
      <P>Teagasc research is carried out in collaboration with similar research programmes in competitor countries, including INRA &ndash; France, RIKILT &ndash; Netherlands, University of Bristol, Danish Meat Research Institute, and USDA &ndash; Philadelphia Laboratory. This keeps the organisation abreast of international developments that are relevant to Irish beef producers and processors.</P>

      <P>The purchase for destruction scheme was introduced by the European Union as a market management measure to remove surplus beef from the market arising from the decline in beef consumption in the union and the closure of many third country markets because of the BSE situation. In general, cattle over 30 months which have not been tested for BSE may be offered by producers for purchase and destruction under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our case, cattle born before the date of the effective implementation of the feed ban are at <Col N="1065" /> greatest risk of contracting BSE. In view of both the numbers of cattle remaining in the national herd from before that time and the relatively small numbers of BSE cases, there is no simple way of targeting the animals at greatest risk which are those born between 1994 and 1996. However, my Department is examining possible options in regard to targeting such animals with a view to expediting the eradication of BSE.</P>
    <P>I should add that there are already a range of measures in place to protect consumer and public health in the context of risks from BSE and that the eradication of the disease will depend on the implementation of controls over a sustained period.</P>

      <P>At a recent meeting of the standing veterinary committee on public health, it was agreed that the vertebral column should be removed from bovines over 12 months of age slaughtered after the 1 April 2001. The decision provides for an exemption for certain named member states from the ban on the vertebral column and there is a provision to allow other member states to apply for a similar derogation. It is my intention to seek a derogation for Ireland from the terms of this decision.</P>
      <P>Among the justifications for seeking such a derogation is the fact that the EU scientific steering committee has assessed Ireland's control measures for BSE as optimally stable since 1998. In addition, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has consistently maintained that there is no public health risk for Irish consumers following the effective implementation of upgraded controls in 1997.</P>
      <P>While I would have preferred if the Commission had granted Ireland a derogation from the outset, I do not believe the decision not to do so will cause major damage to Ireland. Our BSE controls are second to none and the decision allows for the export of carcasses in a form that would include the vertebral column. As indicated, I have already signalled my intention to seek a derogation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that the market for organic food, though it is still quite small, is one of the fastest growing segments of the European food market. In Ireland, the statistics show that the demand for organic produce outstrips supply and we rely heavily on imported produce. My Department, and the bodies under my Department's aegis, is conscious of the need to develop the sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In March 2000, the report of the Agri-food 2010 committee identified the organic sector as an area with potential. It recommended that an organic development committee be established to draw up a coherent strategy for the development of the organic sector.</P>
      <P>I accepted that recommendation and I gave the committee the following terms of reference: to recommend a coherent development strategy to achieve expansion in production, processing and marketing of Irish organic produce and to secure an increased share of the growing national and export markets; and to consider the broad actions necessary for the most advantageous long-term future development of the Irish organic sector while protecting its integrity.</P>
      <P>The committee has representatives of the widest interests in the organic sector including those involved in production, marketing and distribution as well as in areas of research, training, advice and regulation. The farming organisations are represented on it, as are the Consumers Association and the Food Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>The organic development committee met in November 2000 and again in January. Three sub-groups are also considering a number of specific issues. Interested parties who are not represented on the committee were invited to make submissions to it so that it can take account of the widest possible range of views. I have asked the committee to make its recommendations to me by the end of April 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department is also providing financial supports for the organic sector through the national development plan and through the rural environment protection scheme. Under the national development plan, £6 million has been allocated for the development of the organic sector under the regional programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region. This funding will be used to provide grant assistance for both on-farm and off-farm investment in equipment and facilities for preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution. I expect that details of grants available under the regional operational programmes will be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural environmental protection scheme already provides strong support to the organic sector by way of direct grants to farmers. Under the previous REP scheme, organic farmers have received some £17 million on top of their basic REPS payments. The new REP scheme, which <Col N="1067" /> was introduced in November 2000, includes the same provisions and I am confident that payments to organic farmers will considerably surpass the £17 million that they have already received. Under these provisions an organic farmer can receive up to £5,702 a year on top of his or her basic REPS payment of up to £4,757 while a holding is in conversion to full organic status, and up to £2,867 extra thereafter.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to liase with Bord Bia and Bord Glas in developing the market potential of the organic sector. Bord Bia, which carries out ongoing work in relation to surveying, investigating and developing markets and potential markets for food, believes that the Irish organic sector has the potential to become a significant niche within the overall food market. Substantial work is also being done by Teagasc to support the development of the organic sector through research projects, education and training.</P>
    <P>While no specific targets have been set for the production of organic food, all the indications are that demand will continue to grow. I am confident that the continuing supports available through the REPS, the funding available under the national development plan and the work being done by Bord Glas, Bord Bia and Teagasc provide a solid platform for the development of the organic sector. At this stage I shall await the findings of the organic development committee before considering further steps to develop the sector.</P>

      <Quest>if he is concerned about instances where meat imported from Germany to the UK and other markets has been found to contain specified risk materials; if inspections here are adequate to ensure that all meat coming from this market is examined for specified risk materials; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I take extremely seriously any instance where specified risk material is found in meat irrespective of the origin of the meat. The Deputy's question, I presume, arises from an incident last week where a small amount of spinal cord was discovered in a consignment of 240 bovine quarters imported from Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that occasion, as part of our routine BSE control measures, veterinary officials of my Department inspected the consignment prior to unloading and detected a 2½ inch section of spinal cord in one of the quarters. The affected quarter was condemned as unfit for human consumption and sent for destruction. The remainder of the consignment was subsequently released for commercial processing having been subjected to thorough examination. The detection of this small <Col N="1068" /> piece of spinal cord in a consignment of approximately 20 tonnes of meat effectively demonstrates the level of vigilance exercised by the veterinary inspectors of my Department. I am satisfied that the control measures in place in premises for which my Department has responsibility ensure that meat imported is thoroughly inspected for risk material.</P>

      <Quest>the actions being taken, or planned, to assist the market recovery of Ireland to EU and international markets in order to place the industry on a better long-term footing and obviate the need for a destruction scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The task of recovering export markets is based very much on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product based on a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland, the way in which it is dealt with and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. In many cases, particularly in non-EU countries, the situation has been exacerbated by media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on BSE developments in those countries which have recently encountered their first cases. While the factors which precipitated the current crisis have been entirely outside of our control, I and my officials, along with An Bord Bia, will continue to explore every avenue in regard to the re-opening of these markets to Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Egypt, which is our most important market, purchased some 157,000 tonnes of Irish beef in 1999 and some 113,000 tonnes in the January to September last year. I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in a effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke by telephone with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. Senior officials of my Department returned to Egypt this week to continue discussions on a technical level. With regard to Saudi Arabia, a senior official of my Department travelled to Saudi Arabia earlier this month to brief the Saudi authorities on the BSE situation and the level of controls in place in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is in constant contact with the relevant authorities in all of our other important markets, both directly and through diplomatic channels, to emphasise to them the level of BSE controls in place in Ireland and to point out the assurances we can offer in relation to the safety of Irish beef. We are also drawing attention to the very significant fact that our SRM, specified risk material, and MBM, meat and bonemeal, controls have been in place for a number of years; that they have been implemented effectively and <Col N="1069" /> that these measures have stood up to scrutiny by the EU scientific steering committee. It is clear that a restoration of exports to these markets is linked to an easing of the concerns about BSE at EU level.</P>
    <P>My objective throughout this difficulty is to support the commercial slaughter industry as a top priority but, given the current position where our major export markets have closed, it has been essential to underpin the sector by the implementation of the purchase for destruction scheme as a vital market support mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of recent developments at EU level it is likely that in future there will be greater commercial demand for cattle slaughtered below 30 months. While the finishing of cattle is primarily a matter for the industry, my Department has asked Teagasc to prepare guidelines for farmers on the feeding and management strategies needed to facilitate the finishing of cattle before they reach 30 months of age. I understand that Teagasc has now circulated a briefing document to its livestock advisers around the country. Teagasc has also prepared leaflets for farmers on this issue and will be holding a series of public demonstrations in the near future on appropriate feeding and breeding practices for cattle from the suckler cow herd.</P>
      <P>While it is the case that steers from the suckler herd will have the greatest difficulty in reaching the finishing stage by 30 months of age, Teagasc research shows that it is quite possible. Producers who wish to finish these cattle early will have to pay greater attention to good husbandry practices generally, including animal health, good performance at grass, silage quality and the feeding of concentrates where good quality silage is not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU regulations governing the REP scheme make specific provisions which are applicable in circumstances where land that forms part of a REPS contract is the subject of a compulsory purchase order or is afforested. In such cases the regulations provide that reimbursement of aid already paid shall not be required though future payments under the scheme will be reduced to reflect the reduction in the area covered by the contract if it falls below 40 hectares, which is the maximum area on which REPS payments can be calculated.</P>
      <P>Where lands are transferred or otherwise disposed of other than through compulsory purchase or by afforestation, all aid already paid proportionate to the transferred land must normally be reimbursed. However, where it is established that a local authority purchased land voluntarily from a REPS participant for road improvement purposes then the reimbursement of aid already paid may be dispensed with on a case by case basis provided that the purchase is notified in writing to the Department by the vendor and the local authority and the existing REPS plan is revised to reflect the area disposed of.</P>
      <P>In cases where a clawback may not be required under these specific circumstances, future payments will, as in cases of compulsory purchase or afforestation, be based on the reduced area as submitted in the revised plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that the price at which German young bull beef is available in Ireland is in anyway influenced by trade practices which are contrary to EU rules. The import of German beef into Ireland is due to the substantial surplus of beef in Germany because of the sharp decline in consumption in that country as a result of the BSE situation there. The fall in consumption has <Col N="1071" /> resulted in a considerable fall in cattle prices in Germany and the price for young bulls in Germany is now substantially lower than the price for steers in Ireland. The most recent figures available show that prices for young bulls in Germany are on average 51% of the intervention prices whereas prices for Irish steers are 79% of the intervention price.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the import of German beef into Ireland is responsible for low cattle prices in Ireland. I am concerned, however, that competition from low priced German beef on the EU market is exerting considerable downward pressure on Irish cattle prices. German prices have fallen below the safety net level for intervention purchasing and it is likely that a substantial quantity of German beef will be accepted into intervention at tomorrow's meeting of the beef management committee. In addition, I understand German exporters have recently concluded contracts for the export of bull beef to Russia. These developments should lead to an increase in German prices in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>The total income of farm households includes income from farming, income from off-farm employment, social welfare payments and income from other sources.</P>
      <P>To date, the only published information on total farm household income has been drawn from the CSO's household budget survey. The most recent HBS for which results have been published is 1994-95. I understand that results for 1999-2000 should be published later this year.</P>
      <P>Teagasc's 1999 national farm survey report included, for the first time, information on the off-farm employment income of farmers, but not other household members, as well as the usual data on farming income. My Department is also currently sponsoring work by the ESRI, using the living in Ireland survey, which should add further to information in this area. I am also aware that Eurostat is seeking similar information.</P>
      <P>I remain concerned at the lack of regular up to date information on total farm household income, which is of great importance for informed policy making. My Department will continue to work with Teagasc, the CSO and the ESRI to encourage them to address this important gap in the information available to us.</P>

      <P>The purchase for destruction scheme was introduced by the EU Commission as a market support measure to provide an outlet for beef for which there is no other market at present because of the decline in beef consumption in many member states and the closure of most of our third country markets.</P>
      <P>The destruction scheme is, therefore, a market support scheme and is not designed to eliminate the threat of BSE. Several measures, including the removal of SRM from the food and feed chain and the introduction of rapid BSE testing for all cattle over 30 months, have been taken to minimise the risks posed by BSE to humans. These measures will increase consumer protection and help to restore consumer confidence in beef in the EU, which is a prerequisite to market recovery in the sector and the re-opening of those third country markets which have imposed a ban on the import of beef from the EU.</P>

    <P>The European Commission has indicated that payments under an area based scheme cannot be linked to production on the farm and can only be differentiated by reference to the disadvantaged status of the land in question. In Ireland's case land is designated as more severely handicapped and less severely handicapped and coastal areas with specific handicap and within those areas certain types of land are classified as mountain type grazing.</P>
    <P>The land parcel identification system which is in place in my Department is capable of attributing the appropriate disadvantaged status to each land parcel claimed by farmers on their area aid applications. The question of assessing each individual farmer's holding does not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>The Government has already committed some £360 million additional funding for the scheme over the period 2001-06. The new arrangements involve a cost of £180 million in 2001, representing an increase of about £60 million over 2000. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 currently to 109,000 in 2001. From 2001, some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 farmers will incur some losses. I have, however, negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
    <P>My officials are currently reviewing the scheme to see if an equitable long-term solution can be found to the problem of reduced payments particularly in mountain type areas.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to target cattle herds and age groups most vulnerable to BSE through the purchase for destruct scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase for destruction scheme, was introduced by the European Union as a market management measure in order to remove surplus beef from the market arising from the decline in beef consumption in the Union and the closure of many third country markets because of the BSE situation. In general, cattle over 30 months of age which have not been tested for BSE may be offered by producers for purchase and destruction under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been suggestions about a targeted cull of cows. The feasibility of such a proposal is under active examination, but there are limiting factors, not least the difficulty in building an adequate epidemiological profile because of the low numbers of BSE infected animals. In this regard it should be noted that cows slaughtered under the scheme account for 31% of the total.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive range of measures is in place for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herd mates, birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals.</P>
      <P>This regime has been independently verified by a number of independent bodies, including the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission, and found to be operating effectively. Indeed, the conclusions of the EU Commission's geographical risk assessment of member states and third countries last year was that the system operating in Ireland has been &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo; since 1 January 1998. The Deputy will also be aware that these measures have been supplemented by a programme of targeted active surveillance for BSE among fallen and casualty animals, and that all cattle over 30 months of age entering the food chain are now being tested for BSE.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied this range of measures is proving effective, and that it provides a sound basis for consumer confidence in beef and for the protection of public health.</P>

      <P>The results of mechanical grading trials carried out in Ireland in August 1999 and March 2000 were communicated to the EU Commission in March 2000 and were the subject of discussion at beef management committee meetings in March and April 2000.</P>
      <P>The consensus of opinion was that the trial had been carried out in a highly professional manner. While the three machines involved achieved high accuracy results in relation to conformation and meat content of the carcasses they failed to attain the standards proposed by the EU Commission in its draft regulation setting standards to be met by these machines prior to their approval for classification purposes. Following discussion in the beef management committee, the EU agreed to carry out a pilot test to examine whether these standards were practicable.</P>
      <P>Germany was selected as the venue for the pilot test which was to be held at the end of November 2000. An official from my Department was to have taken part in the trial. Unfortunately, because of the BSE crisis in Germany it was not possible to proceed with the trial. It is the intention of the Commission to proceed with the trial as soon as the BSE situation allows. As soon as this work is completed and the Commission sets standards for approval of mechanical systems, it is my intention to proceed with an authorisation trial, which will hopefully lead to the early introduction of mechanical beef classification in Ireland.</P>

      <P>A total of 37 rural development groups were selected to deliver the Leader II programme currently being concluded. The names and rural areas served by the groups will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In the period to 2006, Leader activity will be delivered through two mechanisms, being the EU Leader+ programme and the national rural development programme. A total amount of £117 million is allocated and both programmes are co-funded.</P>
      <P>The EU Leader+ programme was submitted by my Department to the Commission last November in accordance with the Commission's guidelines. A period of five months is provided for examination of the programme by the Commission in the context of determining approval. At the same time, the Commission will give its final approval for the national rural development programme. My Department is in negotiation and discussion with the Commission to provide clarifications and additional material promptly so as to clear the way for programme approval at the earliest date possible.</P>
      <P>In parallel, the selection procedure is under way to determine the groups to deliver the programmes. The formal appointment of groups and the allocation of funding will be decided by Government following receipt of the Commission's approval of the operational programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precise number of groups which will be appointed to deliver the programmes will be determined having regard to the Commission approval text. In addition, the findings of the task force on integration of local government and local development systems will have to be taken into account. The requirement is that overlap in delivery of local programmes should be avoided to minimise any duplication so as to maximise the allocated resources.<Col N="1079" /></P>

      <P>The position is that in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I introduced a national interim framework plan for all commonages, in 1998. Under the terms of that interim framework plan all sheep farmers with mountain ewes and commonage land in the six western counties who were not already participating in the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, were required to reduce their ewe numbers by 30% in November &ndash; December 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This national interim framework plan for commonages was put in place pending the completion of detailed framework plans for individual commonages which will incorporate the main environmental measures in the agri-environment programme already agreed with the EU Commission in 1998. The new measure requires that a detailed framework plan be drawn up for each commonage under the supervision of my Depart<Col N="1081" /> ment and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In addition, significantly enhanced payments are available under REPS for farmers with land in natural heritage areas and commonages.</P>
    <P>Work on the preparation of detailed commonage framework plans is nearing completion and it is expected that the plans will become available during the summer. The plans are being prepared by teams consisting of agriculturists and environmentalists.</P>
    <P>The main aim of these detailed framework plans will be to set sustainable stocking levels which will allow for the regeneration of damaged vegetation.  When these plans are implemented stocking rates will be set which will reflect the environmental needs of each commonage. In the meantime some 5,249 sheep farmers in the counties concerned may not increase their sheep quota. Of this number some 2,000 are already participating in the REPS. Those farmers who are not participating in REPS have been compensated annually for the reduction in ewe numbers through a scheme administered by my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    <P>When the detailed commonage framework plans are completed it will be a condition of the disadvantaged areas' compensatory allowance scheme and the ewe premium scheme that farmers with commonage land must be participating in an approved REPS plan or a national agri-environment plan to be operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. It is expected that such cross-compliance will be put in place next year.</P>

      <P>Ireland will be seeking a derogation from the terms of the recent decision of the Standing Veterinary Committee on the vertebral column which is due to come into effect on 1 April 2001. Among the bases for seeking such a derogation is the endorsement of Ireland's stringent BSE controls by the EU scientific steering committee and position taken by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on Ireland's handling of BSE in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would have preferred if the Commission had granted Ireland a derogation from the outset, I do not believe that decision not to do so will cause major damage to Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The task of recovering export markets is based very much on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product based on a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland, the way in which it is dealt with and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks that are in place. In many cases, particularly in non-EU countries, the situation has been exacerbated by media reporting on BSE and, in particular, on BSE developments in those countries which have recently encountered their first cases. While the factors which precipitated the current crisis have been entirely outside of our control, I and my officials, along with An Bord Bia, will continue <Col N="1083" /> to explore every avenue in regard to the re-opening of these markets to Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Egypt, which is our most important market, purchased some 157,000 tonnes of Irish beef in 1999 and some 113,000 tonnes in the January to September last year. I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met with the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in a effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke by phone with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. Senior officials of my Department returned to Egypt this week to continue discussions on a technical level. With regard to Saudi Arabia, a senior official of my Department travelled to Saudi Arabia earlier this month to brief the Saudi authorities on the BSE situation and the level of controls in place in Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department is in constant contact with the relevant authorities in all of our other important markets, both directly and through diplomatic channels, to emphasise to them the level of BSE controls in place in Ireland and to point out the assurances we can offer in relation to the safety of Irish beef. We are also drawing attention to the very significant fact that our SRM, specified risk material, and MBM, meat and bonemeal, controls have been in place for a number of years; that they have been implemented effectively and that these measures have stood up to scrutiny by the EU scientific steering committee. It is clear that a restoration of exports to these markets is linked to an easing of the concerns about BSE at EU level.</P>

      <P>The numbers of confirmed cases of BSE for 2000 should be seen in their proper context both statistically and against the background of the stringent controls that we have in place to deal with BSE itself and to protect consumers.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the higher numbers last year, I remain satisfied that the comprehensive range of measures we have in place is proving effective. In the first instance, the overall incidence of BSE continues to be extremely low with a total of 145 cases last year in a cattle population in excess of 7.2 million. This compares with a total of more than 177,000 in the UK and a peak of more than 36,000 confirmed cases in that country in 1992 alone, in a cattle population of 12 million. To put our position into perspective, the disease incidence here represents 0.002% of our total cattle population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> The higher number of cases here was foreseen in the recent report of the European Union's Scientific Steering Committee which predicted a temporary increase in numbers for the next couple of years from animals infected prior to the additional measures introduced in 1996 and 1997 taking full effect. That Committee also concluded that the Irish system was &lsquo;optimally stable', from 1998 meaning that the measures in place since then prevent the agent of BSE from re-infecting cattle.</P>
    <P>While the predictions of the scientific steering committee in relation to a temporary increase in the numbers of infected animals have been borne out, of more significance, however, is that the increasing age profile of BSE positive animals detected. To date no animals born after 1996 have been detected with BSE, and an increasing proportion of infected animals are six year of age or older. This would appear to bear out the scientific steering committee's conclusion that the Irish control system is &lsquo;optimally stable', meaning that the control measures in place in Ireland prevent the recycling of the BSE agent through ruminant feed. In that context, I recognise that the control measures must be rigorously enforced.</P>

    <P>The introduction of the purchase for destruction scheme, which is to remain in place until 30 June, has provided very substantial support to the beef market since its introduction on 8 January. It is my intention to do everything possible however to facilitate the recovery of commercial markets. I have been pressing Commissioner Fischler for an increase in export refunds in order to increase exports to third countries. In addition, my Department is using all of the technical and diplomatic resources available to secure the re-opening of third country markets, such as Egypt, which have imposed bans on imports of beef from the European Union because of the current BSE situation. I believe that a successful outcome to <Col N="1085" /> these efforts would ensure that cattle prices in Ireland remain at reasonable levels.</P>

      <Quest>the number of farmers expected to join the new REP scheme; the studies which have been carried out to assess and quantify the benefits to the environment arising from farmer participation in the REP scheme, specifically benefits arising from a prescribed farm nutrient plan and the control of on-farm pollution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The projected level of participation in REPS by the end of 2006 is 70,000. Participation in the existing scheme stands at 45,500. I am hopeful that the great majority of these farmers will continue their participation in REPS under the new scheme and I expect that first-time entrants will bring the total to the level that I have indicated by 2006. A financial provision in excess of £1.6 billion has been made for REPS over that period.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive evaluation of REPS was submitted to the European Commission in July 1999. This evaluation assessed how the objectives of the scheme had been met. It examined the agricultural, socio-economic and environmental impact of REPS and made practical recommendations for future modifications and improvements. Independent consultants were engaged to consider the various inputs to the evaluation process and to put together a comprehensive and objective assessment. Submissions were received from concerned organisations including the Heritage Council, BirdWatch Ireland, Teagasc and the farming organisations. Independent studies were also commissioned on particular measures of the REP scheme under the auspices of Teagasc and the universities.</P>
      <P>Participants in REPS are required to follow a nutrient management plan which is drawn up for each farm. The plan identifies pollution control facilities on the farm, it ensures the efficient use of nutrients in an environmentally friendly manner and it sets limits on application rates of fertilisers. The 1999 evaluation report found that nutrient management plans are contributing significantly to the REP scheme objective of reducing agriculture's contribution to environmental problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of farm pollution scheme was specifically examined by the independent analysis and evaluation unit which was set up under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99, OPARDF. The examination took place as part of an evaluation of the environmental effects of the <Col N="1086" /> OPARDF, which was completed in August 1999. The evaluation found that the management of waste and pollution control facilities was of the utmost importance in preventing pollution and, as a consequence, in protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>On 1 February I launched the new scheme of investment aid for farm waste management which is provided for in the national development plan. Under this new scheme farmers will be eligible for grant aid of up to 40% on a maximum investment of £40,000. It also provides for additional assistance for younger farmers. Mobile slurry equipment is eligible for grant aid and this will allow farmers optimum flexibility in relation to the landspreading of farm wastes.</P>

      <P>The new scheme, which will commence on 1 April 2001, will cater first of all for those producers whose entitlements were not fully met under last year's schemes. Included in this category are producers who had been dependent on temporary leasing in recent years, those who had purchased quota under recent restructuring schemes and those who had lost land and quota leases. I am also making special provision for recent and new entrants to the sector. A total of 20% of the restructured quota pool, after the entitlements I have already referred to have been dealt with, would go to recent and new entrants to the sector who were under 35 on 1 April 2001. The balance of quota available in the pool will go to all producers on the basis of a 3:2:1 ratio to categories I, II and III, as was done last year. The category bands are being adjusted upwards &ndash; category I to 180,000 litres from 160,000 and category II to 275,000 litres from 255,000 litres.</P>
      <P>Following the trend over recent years and in line with the clear indication I gave last year, the maximum price at which quota may be bought and sold under the scheme is being reduced and will be fixed at 27p per litre, approximately £1.23 per gallon. This is a fair price, taking account of the requirements of active milk producers who need to increase their quotas and also of those who wish to give up or curtail milk production and sell all or part of their quotas.</P>
      <P>I have made my decision on the details of the new restructuring scheme taking account of the overall requirements of the sector. As usual I have been guided by the very clear recommendations of the milk quota review group whose members represent the various interests in the industry.</P>

      <P>As far as third country markets are concerned, I have made strong representations to the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Fischler, for an increase in export refunds. Efforts are ongoing at political, technical and diplomatic level, involving my own Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia to reopen those markets which are closed to us.

      <P>On compensation for cattle which were sold in the later part of last year, I have already stated that it is not open to me to provide compensation to producers who sold these cattle.

In relation to the dissemination of information of BSE to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers and butchers, my Department has done its utmost to ensure that all those involved in the industry are well informed. Information leaflets have been made available for distribution to farmers at marts. In addition my Department has produced a video on BSE which is available to veterinary surgeons. The video has also been distributed to all veterinary officials in meat factories, and to factory management, who have been advised to show it to all staff involved in the selection of animals for slaughter. Copies of the video have also been distributed to local authority veterinary inspectors who have responsibility for controls at local authority abattoirs. My Department has made strenuous efforts to keep all of those involved in the industry fully informed and I will continue to treat the provision of appropriate information to those who need it as a priority.</P>
      <P>My Department has always dealt with the issue of BSE in as open and transparent manner and has provided information through replies in this House, the Department's website and of course the media on a regular basis. I have already acknowledged the absolute necessity of maintaining public confidence in the beef industry and I have no doubt that the best way to this is to provide the most up to date information available in relation to the controls we implement and in relation to the incidence of the disease in Ireland. I am happy, therefore, to continue to keep the public and the media fully informed in relation to this disease, as I have up to now. The Deputy will be aware that I recently to make available to the media on a weekly basis the relevant BSE statistics which were formerly provided on a monthly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that a comprehensive range of measures are in place for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herd mates, birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animals, a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction <Col N="1090" /> of specified risk materials from ruminant animals. This regime has been independently verified by a number of independent bodies, including the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission and found to be operating effectively. Indeed the conclusions of the EU Commission's geographical risk assessment of member states and third countries last year was that the system operating in Ireland has been optimally stable since 1 January 1998. The Deputy will also be aware that these measures have been supplemented by a programme of targeted active surveillance for BSE among fallen and casualty animals and that all cattle over 30 months entering the food chain are now being tested for BSE. I am satisfied that this range of measures is proving effective and that it provides a sound basis for consumer confidence in beef and for the protection of public health.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland, EEI Limited, acting as operator for the proposed development of the Corrib gas field having recently declared the field commercial have applied to me for a petroleum lease to develop it. This lease has not yet issued but I expect that I will be in a position to do so within the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>On receipt of a petroleum lease, EEI must then apply to me for approval for the working of the petroleum at which stage their plan of development, accompanied by an environmental impact statement, both of which have already been submitted to me will be examined in my Department before I will be in a position to issue approval in respect of the development. At that stage EEI will be obliged to publish in at least one daily newspaper published in the State a notice stating, <i>inter alia</i>, that it has applied to me for approval for the working of the petroleum indicating the location and nature of the proposed working and also that an environmental impact statement has been prepared and submitted to me in respect of the proposed working. EEI must name a place where a copy of the environmental impact statement may be inspected or purchased by any interested person specifying the time and the period, being the prescribed period, during which the environmental impact statement can be inspected or purchased. During the prescribed period any person may make a submission or observations to me in relation to the effects on the environment to the proposed working.</P>
      <P>The plan of development to be examined by my Department in connection with my approval for the working of the petroleum contains details of a proposed onshore pipeline route passing through Rossport, County Mayo leading to a proposed terminal site at Bellanaboy Bridge some eight kilometres away. The route of this pipeline will not be fixed until I have considered all the technical and environmental aspects of the proposed route and I give my final approval to it.</P>

      <P>Technology is available to process gas offshore on a gas field such as Corrib. However this would not eliminate the need for an onshore terminal and such a terminal would have all the essential features of a terminal in circumstances where there is no offshore processing. These features would include a flare stack, provision for storage of liquids, provision for installation for compressors and facilities for discharging produced fluids, although the volume of produced fluids discharged from an onshore terminal where there is offshore processing would be much less. Offshore processing for the Corrib gas field is not the preferred development option as it would mean that production would be weather sensitive and there would be greater capital and operational expenditure compared to a subsea development. In addition there would be increased safety concerns as the offshore facilities would have to be manned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall responsibility for marine pollution prevention, preparedness, response and management is assigned to the Irish coastguard. This includes responsibility for dealing with all aspects of oil pollution of the sea and coastal areas, and in particular supervising the planning and implementation by local and harbour authorities of arrangements for the protection of coastal amenity/fishery/wildlife areas, the removal of oil from the coastline, and in the event of a major pollution incident, the direction and coordination of the onshore response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1999, provides the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources with the legislative power to require harbours and ports, oil handling facilities, and maritime local authorities to submit contingency <Col N="1093" /> plans, based on realistic risk assessment, for approval by the coastguard. Templates for these plans have been provided to the harbour and port authorities which require risk assessment and a comprehensive breakdown of their risk management facilities &ndash; command and control, communications, manpower, equipment, training, and exercises. These contingency plans are part of the overall national plan, also required by the above Act, which is being prepared by the coast guard.</P>
    <P>The coastguard has provided national pollution management courses for approximately 40 harbour-port and local authority personnel per year for the past number of years. These courses are based on the International Maritime Organisation standards. Due to the demand it is intended to increase these courses from two to three per year catering for 60 participants. The coastguard also sends harbour-port and local authority personnel on European courses provided by the EU.</P>
    <P>The coastguard has national stockpiles of equipment at Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dublin. This equipment is used in the pollution courses and as far as possible compliments the equipment held at the harbours and ports. This equipment is valued at over £2 million and is being added to each year. The equipment is divided into 30% off-shore response and 70% on-shore response.</P>
    <P>No country has sufficient state equipment to respond to every pollution emergency. However, there are commercial companies who will provide equipment on request and guarantee it will be on-site within 12 to 24 hours. The coastguard has my authority to contract equipment as required. Ireland has been invited to accede to the Bonn agreement. This agreement is between north European countries and provides for mutual support in marine pollution incidents. Ireland is also a member of the EU pollution management committee which can provide experts and support drawn from other EU countries in support of a member state response.</P>
    <P>The coastguard can call on its marine pollution response team in major emergencies. This team is made up of coastguard and marine surveyors office personnel from my Department and local and harbour-port authority personnel. This team has managed emergencies very competently in the past.</P>
    <P>I have Government approval to further study the provision of emergency towing vessels on the south west approaches and the Irish Sea for intervention and pollution prevent in marine emergencies. This approval followed the publication on the ETV study.</P>
    <P>I am awaiting a report from the marine emergency advisory group on aerial surveillance remote sensing. This facility would provide a detection and deterrent of pollution and the means to prosecute illegal discharge in the Irish pollution responsibility zone. Marine pollution response in Ireland is continuously developing and co-operation between harbour-port and local <Col N="1094" /> authorities and the oil companies is strongly encouraged and facilitated by the coastguard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The humanitarian situation being faced by the people of Iraq is of major concern to the Government. We are taking every opportunity at the United Nations and elsewhere to hold discussions on this complex issue with the various parties, including other Security Council members and key United Nations personnel. In these discussions we are stressing the urgent need to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, especially children, and to greatly improve the conditions of the general population who are directly affected by the implementation of the UN sanctions.</P>
      <P>Our approach to this issue, as a member of the Security Council, is informed both by the need to address the human suffering and to ensure that Iraq complies with the decisions of the Security Council. All countries are required under the UN charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council and Ireland stands by this obligation.</P>
      <P>The major problem is not one of revenue to fund the purchase of needed supplies. Instead it is a problem of clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme. There have been unacceptable hold-ups due to the inadequate level of co-operation by the Iraqi authorities and the workings of the sanctions committee. It is our view that the Security Council should take greater account of the humanitarian situation in its further deliberations on this matter. This is the most useful course to follow.</P>
      <P>Our policy is to advocate more significant reductions in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme. I have previously informed the House that the Taoiseach and I raised this issue with the former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, in Washington last March, and I would urge the Bush administration to accelerate the progress made in reducing the delays on needed medicines and spare parts for Iraqi infrastructure. In any event the new administration is likely to review existing US foreign policy positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acting under the provisions of Resolution 1284, the Council introduced a streamlined procedure for the approval of humanitarian supplies last March. Under this procedure, $2 billion worth of contracts for the food, educational, medical, agricultural, water and sanitation sectors were approved on a basis of notification to the sanctions committee. A much enhanced allocation for spare parts for the ailing Iraqi oil indus<Col N="1095" /> try, a doubling of the budget to $1.2 billion was also approved. The Security Council has since built on these provisions, most recently in Resolution 1330, which extends the range of sectors requiring notification only. This progress needs to be developed further.</P>
    <P>The Iraqi authorities have yet to co-operate adequately with the oil for food programme. For example, Iraqi failure to process orders has led to $1.5 billion worth of goods being placed on hold and Iraqi attempts to levy a surcharge on oil exports recently led to a temporary suspension of these exports. The Iraqi Government is also responsible for diversion of revenue through its large scale oil smuggling.</P>
    <P>There is a growing international awareness of the need to ensure that economic sanctions, which are the alternative to the use of armed force, accomplish their intended objectives. A working group of the Security Council has been examining the general question of the effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes. Its report is expected to stress the need to take much more careful account of humanitarian aspects. This should influence the debate about the effect of sanctions in a constructive direction.</P>
    <P>The Iraqi Government's refusal to co-operate with the UN commissions appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction is the basis for the continued imposition of the sanctions. The ten years since the Gulf War is too long a period of time for the stand-off to persist at such a dreadful human cost.</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 1284 provides for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with a new disarmament supervisory commission (UNMOVIC) and compliance with the conditions imposed by the Security Council. I wish to see the necessary co-operation from Baghdad to allow concrete progress to be made on the suspension, and ultimate lifting, of the sanctions. This would be a major step towards the return of Iraq to its rightful place in the international community.</P>
    <P>The Government has also directly addressed the humanitarian issues. A grant of £100,000 by Ireland Aid to the international committee of the Red Cross was made last November to address the rehabilitation of health, water and sanitation facilities in Iraq.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated in replies to a number of parliamentary questions, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are proposing to establish new pension schemes for their serving staff and pensioners. The terms of the new pension schemes are essentially a matter for the companies concerned to negotiate with staff interests taking account of overall Government policy on public sector pensions, affordability and broader industrial relations priorities for the companies going forward. Existing Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners who transfer to the new schemes will receive the improved benefits.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is proposing in its new scheme that pensioners will be guaranteed increases in line with the consumer price index provided it does not exceed 5%. Should the CPI exceed 5%, the trustees of the new scheme may, at their discretion, award further percentage increases to pensions in payment on the basis of advice from the scheme's actuary. It is also proposed that the new scheme will provide improved benefits in areas such as guaranteed pension payment periods and death-in-service benefits.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus advises that the overall terms of the proposed new scheme will be in line with practice in the private sector and, in many cases, will have better benefits. The company does not propose to provide for pension increases in line with salary movements for ongoing cost reasons and as it would also necessitate a substantial capital injection which it cannot afford.</P>
      <P>In so far as Aer Rianta is concerned, the company proposes to establish a new scheme as soon as possible in consultation with staff interests. The Department of Finance compared the Irish airlines scheme with the standard public service pension scheme terms. That Department has indicated to my officials that the scheme's core benefits tended to be better than the public service norm. However, the Irish airlines scheme does not provide for automatic pension increases. Instead the trustees of the scheme have increased pensions in line with the annual consumer price index, in keeping with the discretion available to them under the rules of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Department of Finance that there is no general policy which imposes an obligation on public sector bodies such as Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to provide pension increases in line with the public service system, that is in line with the pay increases of serving employees.</P>

      <P>EU Council Directive 92/14/EEC amended by 98/20/EC regulates the operation of jet aircraft within the territories of the member states. The combined effect of these directives means that aircraft are not permitted to operate at an airport within the State as from 1 April 1995, unless there is in force in respect of that aircraft a noise certificate issued by the relevant authority &ndash; the IAA in the case of Irish registered aircraft.</P>
      <P>This noise certificate must certify that the noise made by the aircraft is not greater than the noise levels specified chapter three, of annex 16 to the Chicago convention. However, a number of exemptions in these directives allow chapter two aircraft to continue in operation until April 2002.</P>
      <P>EU Council Regulation 925/1999 which came into force on 4 May 2000 restricts the operation within the European Union of hushkitted aircraft which meet the ICAO chapter three noise levels. The net effect is to limit the introduction of more of these aircraft into Europe. However, existing aircraft may continue in operation.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that Aer Rianta has established communication facilities at its airports in respect of noise issues and other matters and there is ongoing dialogue in this regard.

      <P>The recent White Paper on Defence, which was approved by Government on 20 February 2000, recognised that a feature of the existing FCA organisation is that it has a country-wide geographical spread which will, in general, be retained. In that context the Deputy will be aware that, under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, the Permanent Defence Force is now organised into a new three-brigade structure and the Defence Forces training centre, which is <Col N="1098" /> located in the Curragh. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a board has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the steering group which I set up to undertake a study of the reserve. Under the aegis of this board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have now started upon that process by way of the series of three preliminary regional briefings late last year and by the launch of the steering group report.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, pending completion of the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any aspect of the reorganisation and restructuring of the reserve, including C company headquarters of the 19th infantry battalion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1999, the Government established an interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology. The group examined a wide range of issues and developments including those related to the production of genetically modified food. The group concluded that there was broad agreement among most scientists, among independent food regulatory bodies in this country and other EU and OECD member states and among international bodies such as the World Health Organisation and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation that GM food products currently on the market are as safe as their conventional counterparts. However, this does not warrant complacency or justify concluding that all future GM food will necessarily be free of adverse effects. A prudent and precautionary approach must be taken in the whole area of GM food and crops for food in the context of the current state of scientific knowledge.</P>
      <P>In relation to research under the food institutional research measure of the National Development Plan 2000-06 a sum of £55 million is provided for public good research. The purpose of this measure is to provide a base of expertise and information in genetic technologies that will support innovation and product development in the food industry and assist in ensuring consumer protection. The measure does not provide for a specific allocation of funds for research relating to the production of genetically modified foods. Funding will be awarded on the basis of a competitive tendering process and applications in respect of projects involving research of this kind will be accepted and considered on the same basis as all others. It should also be noted that Teagasc has a research budget available to it.</P>
      <P>Research funding is also available from a number of sources and European Union researchers interested in pursuing the area of genetically modified foods may compete for funding from those sources.</P>

      <P>Consumer confidence in the safety of Irish beef must be based on a full appreciation of the manner in which BSE has been dealt with over the past number of years and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls and checks in place. The controls are applied from farm level right through to slaughter and include strict controls on meat and bone meal rendering, SRM removal and destruction and feed manufacture. The BSE controls applied in Ireland have been described by the EU Commission scientific steering committee as being in the highest possible category.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures in place, which are among the strictest in the world, are sufficient to offer consumers the maximum possible guarantees about the safety of the product. That said, the entire BSE situation is kept under review on an ongoing basis by the EU Commission, the FSAI and my own Department with a view to offering every reassurance possible to the consumer of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>The loss of confidence in EU beef in some of our major markets arises, in particular, from recent developments in other member states of the EU which have only recently had their first BSE cases. The media reporting of these developments in the third countries in question has contributed to the situation and makes it difficult to differentiate between the BSE situation in Ireland and elsewhere within the EU. Every effort is being made at political, technical and diplomatic level to reassure those importing countries about the BSE situation as it applies in Ireland and the guarantees we can offer.</P>

      <P>Under the EU Commission rules which apply to all aids for investment in agricultural holdings, provision is made to increase the percentage of grant aid by 15% in disadvantaged areas and by 5% in other areas for young qualified farmers under 35 years. However, the additional grant rates may be applied only to investments undertaken within five years of setting up in farming. In approving the schemes of investment aid for farm waste management and investment aid for the improvement in dairy hygiene standards the EU Commission applied the above rules. In the circumstances, it is not possible to review the position in relation to the person named in the question.</P>

      <P>Teagasc carried out a study in 1992 into the possibilities of developing snail farming in Ireland. The main findings of the study were that there was little demand for snail meat in Ireland and that virtually all production had to be exported; the international market is competitive; there was no marketing structure for snails and, because of problems with continuity of supply and lack of volume, there was difficulty in establishing organised marketing, processing and distribution structures for snail meat; losses were high and the production period was long in an outdoor system; an indoor system had high labour requirements; there had been a number of <Col N="1104" /> attempts to establish successful snail farms but the majority of those that still existed at the time of the study were achieving low returns for their effort and investment.</P>
      <P>Under the new scheme of investment aid in alternative enterprises grant aid is available for housing and handling facilities for snails. An investment ceiling of £5,000 applies. A grant rate of 40% will apply to eligible applicants with up to 150 income units, while a 20% grant rate will apply to eligible applicants with more than 150 income units and up to a maximum of 200 income units.</P>

      <P>The milk quota appeals tribunal was established to consider applications for additional quota from producers who have suffered extreme hardship as a result of the introduction of the milk quota system. In assessing these applications, the tribunal takes account of the following factors: current quota size; off-farm income and/or other farm enterprises; size of holding; family circumstances, including succession; commitment to dairying; financial problems; previous allocations from the national reserve; and low butterfat representative level.</P>
      <P>While every application to the tribunal is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner, it has not been possible within the constraints of the limited amount of quota available to meet the demands of quota from all applicants. I understand the person in question applied for additional quota from the milk quota appeals tribunal. His case was considered at a meeting of the tribunal on 30 January 2001 but, unfortunately, he was not recommended for an allocation. He has been notified of the outcome of his application. The tribunal is not in a position to re-examine this case during the current milk quota year but he may apply again when application forms become available for the 2001/02 milk quota year. These application forms will be available from milk purchasers and from the milk policy division of my Department after 1 April 2001.</P>

      <P>Supplementary Measure 5 of the previous rural environment protection scheme provided for payments to farmers who undertook to give public access to their land for environmentally friendly leisure and sporting activities. There is no supplementary measure of this kind in the new scheme which commenced on 27 November 2000. Unlike the regulation governing the previous scheme, Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, under which the new scheme is implemented, includes no provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme. In an effort to secure the continued availability of public access as part of REPS, my Department made proposals to the European Commission for the inclusion of the measure in the new scheme as a State aid fully funded by the Exchequer. However, the Commission has indicated that a public access measure was not admissible under the agri-environment title of Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, even as a State aid. Participants in the previous REP scheme who are currently in receipt of payment under Supplementary Measure 5 may continue to avail of payments under this measure until the end of their existing agreements.</P>

      <P>The removal of all stocks of mammalian meat and bonemeal and of feedstuffs containing such mammalian meat and bonemeal, which remained on the licensed units on 1 January 2001, has taken place under the supervision of staff of the district office veterinary inspectorate.</P>
      <P>No licences to purchase mammalian meat and bonemeal for use in the manufacture of fertilisers or for use as a fertiliser have been issued since the beginning of 1998.</P>

      <P>The purchase for destruction scheme, was introduced by the European Union as a market management measure in order to remove surplus beef from the market arising from the decline in beef consumption in <Col N="1108" /> the Union and the closure of many third country markets because of the BSE situation. In general, cattle over thirty months of age which have not been tested for BSE, may be offered by producers for purchase and destruction under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been suggestions in relation to a targeted cull of cows. The feasibility of such a proposal is under active examination but there are limiting factors, not least the difficulty in building an adequate epidemiological profile because of the low levels of BSE. In this regard it should be noted that cows slaughtered under the scheme account for 31% of the total.</P>
      <P>I should add that we have a comprehensive range of measures in place for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herd mates, birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals.</P>
      <P>This regime has been independently verified by a number of independent bodies, including the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission, and found to be operating effectively. Indeed, the conclusions of the EU Commission's geographical risk assessment of member states and third countries last year was that the system operating in Ireland has been &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo;, since 1 January 1998. The Deputy will also be aware that these measures have been supplemented by a programme of targeted active surveillance for BSE among fallen and casualty animals, and that all cattle over 30 months of age entering the food chain are now being tested for BSE.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this range of measures is proving effective, and that it provides a sound basis for consumer confidence in beef, and for the protection of public health.</P>

      <P>As the largest exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere, Ireland has been particularly badly affected by the current BSE crisis in Europe, although the factors which precipitated the recent crisis have been outside of our control.

    <P>The task of recovering export markets is based very much on a restoration of confidence in the safety of our product based on a full appreciation of the low level of BSE in Ireland, the way in <Col N="1109" /> which it is dealt with, the effectiveness of the many layers of controls, checks that are in place and the endorsement of Ireland's handling of BSE by the EU Commission and its standing scientific committee. In many cases, particularly in non-EU countries, the situation has been exacerbated by media reporting on BSE, much of which is ill-informed, and, in particular, on BSE developments in those countries which have recently encountered their first cases.</P>
    <P>My Department along with An Bord Bia is exploring every avenue with regard to the re-opening of these markets to Irish beef. Egypt, which is our most important market, purchased some 157,000 tonnes of Irish beef in 1999 and some 113,000 tonnes in the January to September last year. I and senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt last December and met with the Egyptian authorities in Cairo in a effort to secure restoration of this market for Irish beef. The Taoiseach also spoke by phone with Egyptian President Mubarak on this matter. Senior officials of my Department returned to Egypt this week to continue discussions on a technical level. With regard to Saudi Arabia, a senior official of my Department travelled to Saudi Arabia earlier this month to brief the Saudi authorities on the BSE situation and the level of controls in place in Ireland. A downturn in beef consumption in Europe has compounded the problem.</P>
    <P>My Department is in constant contact with the relevant authorities in all of our other important markets, both directly and through diplomatic channels, to emphasise to them the level of BSE controls in place in Ireland and to point out the assurances we can offer in relation to the safety of Irish beef. We are also drawing attention to the very significant fact that our SRM (specified risk material) and MBM (meat and bonemeal) controls have been in place for a number of years; that they have been implemented effectively and that these measures have stood up to scrutiny by the EU scientific steering committee. It is clear that a restoration of exports to these markets is linked to an easing of the concerns in those third countries about BSE at EU level.</P>

However, before this payment was processed, the Department was notified of a court order obtained by a third party against the herdowner concerned, in respect of a judgment for the sum of £3,523.40. This amount had to be deducted from the payment to be made and it was therefore only possible to issue a payment of £4,504.31 to him. This payment issued in December. There is a small balance due to the herdowner which will be paid to him shortly.</P>

      <P>Products and animals imported directly from third countries and from other member states are monitored. The controls operated in this area by my Department are based on EU harmonised rules governing the veterinary and zoo technical checks applicable to intra-community and third country trade in live animals and animal products. These rules require a range of checks to be carried out and also provide for the imposition of restrictions on, or indeed the banning of trade in animals or particular animal products when this is considered necessary for the protection of public health. Premises in third countries wishing to export animal products to the European Community are subject to inspection and approval by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there are good animal and public health controls in place in the area of pigmeat imports. Products originating in other EU countries are subject to the same hygiene standards as those applying here in Ireland and these are set down in a series of EU directives. They include approval of premises, ante and post mortem official inspections, health marking of meat, quality control procedures etc.</P>
      <P>The level of pigmeat imports from third countries is very low but here also comprehensive controls have been put in place by the EU Commission. These include approval of the country of origin as regards disease situation and reliability of official veterinary services. The slaughterhouses supplying meat must be specifically approved by the Commission. Advance notification of these imports must be given to the veterinary authorities in the first EU country of import where they will be subject to designated checks. For both EU and third country trade, experts from the EU conduct on the spot audits and inspections to verify compliance with the specified standards.</P>

    <P>However, transfers between blood relatives attract stamp duty at half the above rates of duty. This reduction would apply in the situation referred to by the Deputy, i.e. the transfer of a farm from parents to a son or daughter.</P>
    <P>There is also a full stamp duty relief for young trained farmers on transfers of any type of agricultural land. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, this relief was increased from a two-thirds relief to a full relief in the Finance Act, 2000, for three years until 31 December 2002.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the relief a young trained farmer is one who is under 35 years of age at the date of execution of the transfer; and is the holder of one of the specified qualifications e.g. the Teagasc certificate in farming or if born before 1 January 1968, has three years experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc training courses in agriculture and horticulture of 180 hours' duration.</P>
    <P>Where the transferee has completed at least one academic year of the Teagasc certificate in farming at the date of execution of the transfer, he or she may obtain the relief by way of a refund provided that the qualification is obtained within three years of the date of execution of the transfer.</P>
    <P>The aim of this relief is to promote lifetime transfers of land and encourage more young people to pursue farming. No other sector can avail of such a generous relief.</P>

      <P>The position is that the person in question resigned from the Civil Service in 1960 at age 37. Under the superannuation provisions which applied at that time he thereby automatically forfeited any entitlement to superannuation benefits. Section 6 of the Superannuation Act, 1909, was later amended to allow preservation of benefits in the case of established civil servants who, having given at least five years of reckonable service, resigned before age 60. The amendment of the Act applied only to people who resigned on or after 1 June 1973.</P>
      <P>Any concession in this person's case would require amending legislation and would be costly because, <i>inter alia</i>, it would, in equity, have to be applied in the case of all the other people who resigned before the cut-off date. The point at issue has been considered by me and my predecessors on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the report of the commission on public service pensions which considered this issue on the basis of a number of submissions it had received. While the commission had some sympathy with the views expressed in the submissions, it was of the view that, prior to the introduction of preservation, the foregoing of pension was clearly understood to be an integral part of the decision to leave the public service prior to retirement age. The commission also considered that it was appropriate to apply a cut-off date when preservation was being introduced in the mid-1970s. The report goes on to say that the approach adopted by public service schemes, that is, to preserve benefits of all qualifying individuals, not <Col N="1114" /> just service accrued after the effective date, was more favourable than that provided for in the Pensions Act, 1990. For those reasons, the commission did not recommend any change in the conditions which were applied when preservation of benefits was first introduced into public service schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The calculation of retirement benefits, both pension and lump sum, is governed by the rules of the pension scheme of which an employee, whether part-time or full-time, is a member. Lump sums are paid &ldquo;tax-free&rdquo; provided the maximum permissible benefits payable under the rules of the scheme do not exceed the following limits: pension 1/60 x salary x service, not to exceed 40 years, lump sum 3/80 x salary x service, not to exceed 40 years.</P>
      <P>As the salary and length of service of an employee are used to calculate the tax-free lump sum to be paid, it is to be expected that the tax-free lump sum payable to a part-time employee on retirement would, generally speaking, be lower than that payable to a full-time employee. This would not be regarded as discrimination in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Benefits payable under the taxpayer's pension scheme referred to by the Deputy are linked to the taxpayer's social welfare pension entitlement. This has the effect of reducing the payments payable by the pension scheme. There are no Revenue rules that would reduce &ldquo;payments due&rdquo; to a scheme member or pensioner. The rules of the particular scheme, subject to compliance with the limits specified above, determine the benefits payable. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant inspector of taxes has no specific information about the pension fund payments of the taxpayer in question.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as employees are not required to include income arising from the provision of bus and rail passes by their employers in their tax returns there is, therefore, no basis on which to provide an estimate of the numbers involved.

    <P>However, while there are no specific stamp duty exemptions for such cases as that outlined by the Deputy, in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, I reduced the stamp duty rates on transfers of residential property at the lower end of the market for owner-occupiers and first time buyers. In particular, the revised regime is structured to facilitate those who are trying to buy their first home and who are faced with particular difficulties in the market at the present time. However, as the following table shows, owner-occupiers, <Col N="1116" /> who are not first-time buyers, also benefit generally from the revised stamp duty rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax position of lone parents entitled to the one-parent family allowance is broadly similar to that of married couples. Since 1979 one parent families are entitled to an additional tax allowance. A single parent, whether widowed, single, deserted or separated, who has a dependent child-children may claim the allowance which from 6 April 2001 will be £5,500 at the standard rate of income tax. A condition of eligibility for the allowance is that the child must live with the claimant for the whole or part of the year of claim. As a child may live with each parent for part of the year, both parents can claim the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lone parent is also entitled to the single person allowance which is £5,500 from 6 April 2001. The two allowances are equivalent to the married persons allowance of £11,000. Therefore, for the purposes of tax allowances-credits, lone parents receive the same treatment as married couples. In the case of the standard rate band, from 6 April 2001, a lone parent is entitled to a band of £23,150, which compares favourably with the single persons band of £20,000. As part of the com<Col N="1117" /> pletion of the move to tax credits the income condition attaching to the lone parent allowance-tax credit is being abolished with effect from 6 April 2001.</P>
    <P>The lone parent allowance may be claimed by an individual who is not entitled to the married persons allowance, is not living with another individual as man and wife during the year of assessment and has resident a qualifying child or children at any time during the year of assessment. I regard this provision as being reasonable, having regard to the circumstances of separated couples with children. There is no provision for transferring the one-parent family allowance between parents in circumstances where one individual is not using his or her allowances. If a couple are separated, then they cannot apply to have what in effect would amount to married treatment, that is, joint assessment in respect of the lone parent allowance. Indeed, separated couples with children are treated favourably as they are both individually entitled to the same allowances as a married couple. I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Dr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is responsible for legislative provisions concerning the labelling of genetically modified food. These provisions are contained in three main pieces of EU legislation as outlined: (1) Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients. This regulation provides that there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property, for example, composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food, which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. There must also be specific labelling to advise the consumer of the presence in the novel food or novel food ingredient of: material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population, for example, a protein from a known food allergen source such as peanuts; material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which gives rise to ethical concerns, for example, a gene of porcine origin in a plant; or an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification, for example, a genetically engineered tomato.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 49/2000 of 10 January 2000. The labelling and other provisions of the novel foods regulation as outlined above do not apply to foods or food ingredients which were used for human consumption to a significant degree within the EU before the entry into force of the regulation and, therefore, not considered to be novel. The purpose of Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 is to ensure that the provisions of Regulation 258/97 apply to foods and food ingredients containing or consisting of GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation 258/97. The only foods on the market before the novel foods regulation came into force are a genetically modified soya bean, manufactured by Monsanto, and a genetically modified maize, manufactured by Novartis, and so Regulation 1139/98 applies to foods and food ingredients which are produced, in whole or in part, from these products. Regulation 1139/98 lays down additional labelling requirements for the products outlined above. Such labelling ensures that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a foodstuff, then that foodstuff is subject to the additional labelling requirements. In short, the words &ldquo;produced from genetically modified <Col N="1119" /> soya&rdquo; or &ldquo;produced from genetically modified maize&rdquo; must appear in the list of ingredients. Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000 of 10 January 2000 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms. This regulation sets a <i>de minimis</i> threshold level for adventitious &ndash; accidental &ndash; contamination at 1%, of each ingredient individually considered, below which there is no requirement to label the foodstuff as being from a genetically modified source. If a conventional foodstuff contains less than 1% of GM material, present due to accidental contamination of conventional soya or maize with GM soya or maize, and the supplier can provide evidence that the presence is accidental, then that foodstuff will not be subject to the additional labelling requirements as outlined above.</P>
    <P>(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No. 50/2000 of 10 January 2000 on the labelling of foodstuffs and food ingredients containing additives and flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced from genetically modified organisms. This regulation extends the labelling provisions of Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 to additives and flavourings intended to be used in foodstuffs. If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a food additive or flavouring, then that food additive or flavouring is subject to the additional labelling requirements. In short, the words &ldquo;produced from genetically modified ..&rdquo; must appear in the list of ingredients.</P>
    <P>In its White Paper on Food Safety published on 12 January 2000, the EU reiterated its priority of ensuring that the highest standards of food safety are set and maintained throughout the EU. In this White Paper, the EU has committed itself to develop legislative proposals to further harmonise the provisions governing the labelling of food, additives and flavourings containing or derived from GM material. The Commission will also develop provisions on the labelling of food produced without genetic engineering &ldquo;GMO-free food&rdquo;. I look forward to participating in the development of these proposals and will strive to ensure that consumers will be provided with comprehensive information and choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 116 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have estimates of the number of vacancies in the public health service at any one time. However, I am aware that shortages exist in respect of social workers, child care workers, psychologists, nurses, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists.</P>
      <P>With respect to the vacancies in the therapy grades, my Department engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The report is expected within the coming weeks. As an interim measure, progress has been made in increasing the number of training places from October 2000 for the following therapies: speech and language therapy, eight places and occupational therapy, five places.</P>
      <P>The National Social Work Qualifications Board &ndash; NSWQB &ndash; published a report in July 2000, Social Work Posts in Ireland, which recommended the creation of 200 new posts over the next two years. The NSWQB has since recommended the creation of 68 additional training places each year over the next four years. Talks are ongoing with the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Science, and a survey of all employers has taken place to establish how additional practice placement places can be made available.</P>
      <P>The expert group on various health professions recommended that child care workers be accorded formal professional status and that the recruitment of non-qualified staff must eventually cease. It also recommended the establishment of a joint committee to deal with issues arising from the recognition of the autonomy of the profession including the setting up of a proper career structure for both residential and community care workers, the changes required in general management of a child and family services and in case management arising as a consequence, the management of changes arising from the ending of recruitment of non-qualified child care workers, a complete review of the training available to child care workers, with a view to the introduction of a nationally recognised professional qualification and the provision of regular in-service training and the arrangements for training of unqualified staff to an accepted standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This joint committee has been established and its work is ongoing. The work being undertaken by this committee will address many of the recruitment and retention issues facing the profession at the moment. An additional 30 places <Col N="1121" /> have been created in clinical psychology within recent months, and talks are ongoing with university heads of psychology with the aim of increasing this number further from October 2001.</P>
    <P>Nurse staffing difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the situation is improving in this area following recent recruitment initiatives and as recruitment of nurses from abroad begins to pay dividends. The Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; is undertaking a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2001 which should confirm these indications. Nationally, action is being taken across a number of fronts to try to improve the situation, for example, new arrangements have been introduced to give better starting pay to nurses taking up employment by giving full recognition for previous experience at home and abroad. Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced. A significantly improved regime of allowance in respect of nurses working in specialised areas has been introduced. The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels and the opportunities for increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing staff. Both of these recommendations are being addressed by a joint committee representative of nursing unions and health service employers. A separate working party to establish standard criteria in relation to education and training of care assistants has also been convened.</P>
    <P>The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing and the 1999 nurses' pay settlement. A major new recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives. A new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service will come into operation on 1 February. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis. As part of my overall recruitment-retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses: payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses; and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>An advertising campaign aimed at attracting nurses back into the workforce and at attracting nurses back to Ireland ran from 30 November to <Col N="1122" /> 31 December 2000. This generated a significant number of inquiries. The number of nursing training places has been increased by 300 to 1,500 until at least 2002. A further 20 places have been filled on a new direct entry midwifery programme which has been introduced on a pilot basis. Over 1,500 nursing students started training in October 2000 with record intakes to both psychiatric and mental handicap nursing. In order to increase the number of general nursing training places in Dublin, funding has been provided to St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, to commence the pre-registration nursing diploma programme this autumn with an annual intake of 40 students.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in strategic planning through the study of the nursing and midwifery resource. The focus of this work is on longer term planning. The primary objective of the study is to forecast, as far as is possible, future nursing and midwifery workforce needs. An interim report was published in October 2000 and widely circulated within the health services. My £5 million recruitment-retention initiative of 29 November last was an immediate response to a number of the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the establishment of a working group to look specifically at the situation in the Dublin area are almost finalised. This group will examine factors affecting the recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery staff in the Dublin area and recommend innovative ways in which the situation might be improved. These initiatives represent a very significant effort to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>

      <P>Salt intake, particularly in processed foods, is of concern to me and my Department especially as salt intake is associated with raised blood pressure. Today's lifestyle for many families means a higher dependency on convenience foods, which can be high in salt. Given our high rate of heart disease in Ireland, salt intake is an issue I am addressing in the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy building healthier hearts.</P>
      <P>The healthy eating guidelines, developed by the health promotion unit of my Department, highlight that the diet of the Irish population should be based on fresh foods as far as possible. They also highlight the importance of tasting food before adding seasonings, recommend herbs and spices including pepper for flavour enhancement. The guidelines state that reliance on salt to flavour food is not recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The Department of Health and Children also supports the Irish Heart Foundation consensus statement on nutrition and heart health which advises that people eat less salt because current evidence suggests that salt intake is related to the increase in blood pressure which occurs as people get older. My plans with regard to focusing awareness on this problem include highlighting it in the Ireland Needs a Change of Heart campaign, especially in the booklet issued to all households in the country. This year's national healthy eating campaign focuses on food on the go and convenience foods and while the main focus will be on reducing fat intake from these foods, reducing salt intake will also be included.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children also supports the Irish Heart Foundation's happy heart programmes for the workplace and restaurants which emphasise attention to salt intake. In the cardiovascular health strategy it is recommended that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland should examine dietary salt intake and advise on a national policy on salt. This recommendation is being progressed through the work of the heart health task force.</P>

      <P>The number of general practitioners holding GMS scheme contracts has increased significantly in recent years from 1,629 in December 1998 to 1,679 in December 1999 to 1,760 at present. A significant factor in accounting for this rise in numbers is a once-off GMS scheme entry measure agreed with the IMO in 1999. It provides that doctors, in practice on 1 March 1999, having or subsequently acquiring appropriate experience and qualifications may, if they wish, obtain GMS scheme contracts. This entry provision remains effective until 1 March 2004, and, accordingly, over the next few years even more doctors will obtain GMS scheme contracts under the measure for the treatment of medical card patients.</P>
      <P>Apart from that special provision, health boards continue to advertise existing GMS scheme vacancies as they arise either through retirement, death, etc. In addition, existing GMS scheme principals can take on assistants with a view to GMS scheme partnership.</P>
      <P>Health boards have discretion to create new GMS scheme contracts if they consider it necessary in the context of service provision and meeting medical card patients' needs. Having regard to all of the above, and in particular the need to provide a quality based service to medical card patients, I consider the present situation to be satisfactory in terms of entry to the GMS scheme.</P>

      <P>General practitioners have discretion in respect of fees charged by them to private patients for particular treatments and services. They are, therefore, in a position to have regard to the circumstances of any specific case or the situation of any particular patient and may, if they deem it appropriate, waive entirely or significantly reduce the fee to be charaged.</P>
      <P>However, in any instance, where a private patient is unhappy with the fee charged, he or she should bring his or her concern, in the first instance, to the attention of their doctor. If they are unable to resolve the matter, then the patient concerned is free to change their doctor and find one whose fees' scale is more to their liking.</P>
      <P>The very existence of variation in fees is a clear indication that there is price competition in the general practitioner sector and I am satisfied that the situation does not, at present, require a formal investigation.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the introduction of a revised assessment mechanism for chiropodists who wish to work in the public health sector.</P>
      <P>Following the settlement of a High Court case in November 1999, officials of my Department have been involved in discussions with the professional bodies representing chiropodists in Ireland with a view to agreeing the details of how such a revised assessment mechanism should be implemented.</P>
      <P>The revised assessment mechanism is being established in the context of the introduction of a system of statutory registration for a number of health and social care professions, including chiropodists. The aim of the revised mechanism is to ensure that all who wish to practice as a chiropodist in the public health sector are suitably qualified to do so. Under the terms of the High Court settlement the committee will have to assess all applicants by means of interview and-or structured test. Only those whose qualifications are deemed suitable for public sector employment will be involved in carrying out the assessment procedure. These new measures will not result in the lowering of standards and those whose qualifications are not deemed suitable will be given an opportunity to upskill themselves. I am now in the process of establishing the ad hoc committee recommended under the High Court case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have long recognised that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran report, review of orthodontic services, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority received an additional investment of £2.34 million <Col N="1126" /> in 2001 for orthodontic services. I understand that the authority is <i>inter alia</i> recruiting additional orthodontic staff which will address the delay in calling patients for assessment caused, in part, by a shortage of qualified orthodontists in their region.</P>
    <P>As part of this initiative, my Department has approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment would be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of tax credits on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders.</P>
    <P>The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The group has set a target date of 1 April this year for the implementation of the pilot scheme.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to those in private nursing homes is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and Regulations made under that Act.</P>
      <P>Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 provides that individuals resident in nursing homes who are in receipt of a subvention from the health board may not be charged extra for any service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in most nursing homes. Such services include bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency of the person, incontinence wear and bedding, laundry services and appliances necessary to assist a dependent person with the activities of daily living.</P>
      <P>An expenditure review of the scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. It is my intention to bring forward proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from these reports and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' &ndash; tax concessions &ndash; scheme which comes under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is a driver, and £12,500 if the qualifying person is a passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of excise duty on up to 600 gallons of fuel per year and for an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme cost some £22 million in 2000, excluding the annual road tax costs.</P>
      <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April 2001, and from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme will be unable to also avail of the mobility allowance. It was on this basis that the Minister for Finance approved the increase in the mobility allowance payment from £45.60 to £90 per month.</P>
      <P>By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme already have access to transport, which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at eligible people with disabilities who do not enjoy these advantages. I intend however to keep the situation under review and to consult with interested parties on the matter.</P>

      <P>A rationalisation of the existing facilities has been carried out by Dublin Corporation and I understand from the corporation that, at this point, all private emergency accommodation allows residents remain in occupation 24 hours a day, if required.

      <P>As regards accommodation procured prior to the introduction of these arrangements, regular inspections are carried out and standards are constantly being monitored and improved where necessary.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has now issued instructions to taxi licensing authorities regarding arrangements for the refund of certain taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licence fees on the basis of the difference between the default fees specified in the Public Service Vehicles (Amendment) Regulations, 1995 &ndash; £3,000 for an ordinary taxi licence, £100 for a wheelchair accessible taxi licence &ndash; and any higher fee received by a licensing authority prior to 21 November 2000. This measure is designed particularly to benefit holders of wheelchair accessible taxi licences which account for the great majority of taxi licences issued between 1995 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The new taxi regime announced by the Government also discriminates in favour of wheelchair accessibility through the licence fee structure which has been developed, £100 for a new wheelchair accessible taxi licence and £5,000 for other taxi licences. While it has not been practicable to provide for a universal requirement of wheelchair accessibility in the short-term given that early and rapid progress is needed to respond to customer demand for taxis, I have put on record my intention that by end 2003 the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to lone parents and long-term unemployed persons to return to the active labour force. The rules of the scheme require that an application must be made prior to taking up employment. The person concerned commenced employment on 26 October 1999. His application for back to work allowance was not received until June 2000. There is no trace of an earlier application. His claim was refused as it was late. He appealed against this decision but there were no grounds for revising it.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and <Col N="1133" /> neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, this is taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers in direct provision who are being provided with full board accommodation, all meals and other services. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
      <P>A person who leaves direct provision accommodation without clear justification and who subsequently applies for rent supplement or assistance towards a rent deposit is regarded as not having an accommodation need and rent supplements are not payable. The rate of SWA payable in such cases is the same as that payable to people in direct provision. However, a health board may decide in exceptional cases to award a rent supplement due to particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is an asylum seeker who was living in the Dublin 9 area and was receiving a reduced payment of £15 per week. She recently moved to County Kildare and made an application for SWA in Leixlip. The community welfare officer refused the application on the grounds that the accommodation was not suitable. It is open to the individual in question to find alternative suitable accommodation or to appeal the CWO's decision to the health board appeals officer. If the matter is not resolved at this level the applicant can ask the health board to refer the matter to the independent appeals officers in my Department.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. The qualification conditions for the carer's allowance scheme have been significantly improved during my time in office, as follows: the residency conditions for carer's allowance were relaxed to introduce greater flexibility into the scheme, while still safeguarding the needs and interests of the care recipients. This measure allows non-resident carers to be assessed on a case by case basis. The full-time care and atten<Col N="1134" /> tion rules were relaxed to allow carers to engage in part-time work, education or other activities. Carer's allowance was extended to children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and to all people between 16 and 65 who require full-time care and attention. The means test has been greatly improved over a number of budgets. An income disregard of £125 in the case of a single carer, and £250 in the case of a married couple, will apply from April 2001. It is estimated that this increase in the means disregard will qualify an additional 5,000 carers for payment and increase the payment rate of almost 3,000 existing carers.</P>
      <P>I have also introduced other measures to improve the position of carers as follows: the carer's allowance has been increased by £28 per week (40%) for those over 66 and by £18 (26%) for those under 66 in the last four budgets. The increases announced in Budget 2001 will apply from April 2001. Carers in receipt of carer's allowance now qualify for the free schemes &ndash; a major additional benefit. An annual respite care grant was introduced in 1999 and this will be increased to £400 from June 2001. In addition, carers caring for more than one person will receive a double respite care grant of £800. A new carer's benefit scheme was introduced on 26 October 2000. This new scheme provides financial support for 15 months to a person who gives up employment to care full-time. As it is based on a person's PRSI contributions there is no means test. My colleague, Deputy Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, is introducing carer's leave legislation to protect the employment rights of the carer during that 15 month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six weeks payment after death has been extended to carers whose spouse is not in receipt of a social welfare payment. The back to work allowance and back to education allowance have been extended to carers when they cease caring. A project to examine issues relating to long-term care, both in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches, and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard has commenced. It is expected that this study will be completed by the middle of this year. The many improvements I have introduced during the past four years have resulted in a large growth in expenditure on carer's allowance, from £36.5 million in 1997 to a projected £108.4 million this year, representing an increase of 197%. This has had a substantial impact on the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance, which has increased by more than 80% since 1997 and now stands at over 16,700. Since the scheme's inception in 1990 to the end of January 2001, some 970 applications have been received from carers in County Sligo and 604 applications from carers in County Leitrim. A detailed breakdown on all applications received since 1990 is not available. However, current figures indicate that there are, at present, <Col N="1135" /> 307 carers in receipt of carer's allowance resident in Sligo and 203 carers resident in Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot, and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities.</P>
    <P>The many measures I have introduced for carers clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers and are a concrete expression of our appreciation for their valuable role in our society. Improvements have also been introduced by other Ministers covering their areas of responsibility and the position of carers in our society will be kept under review in a budgetary context across all relevant Departments in line with the Government's commitment to this group.</P>

      <P>The old age non-contributory pension is a social assistance scheme which is designed to provide financial support for older people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension schemes. In common with other social assistance schemes the OANCP features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to remove the means test as a qualifying condition. However, its operation is kept under review and changes are made as required. In October 2000 I introduced a much more generous and easily understood new method of capital assessment for most means-tested schemes, including old age non-contributory pension, came into operation. Under the new method, the first £10,000 of capital is disregarded, capital between £10,000 and £20,000 is assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, capital between £20,000 and £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital and capital above £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital. The new system is designed to ensure that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support. Any further changes to the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Within the social welfare system there are a number of arrangements to assist women working in the home. Child benefit is normally payable to the mother, recognising the important value of the work done by the primary carer, who is usually the mother. The £1 billion three year child benefit investment package commenced in this year's budget will strengthen the position of those who choose to work in the home and care for their children in that way, while simultaneously easing the burden for those who opt to go out to work and use child care arrangements.</P>
      <P>With effect from next June, a full three months earlier than usual, child benefit rates for first and second children will increase by £25 to £67.50 per month and by £30 to £86 per month for third and subsequent children. That constitutes a full year investment of £330 million and marks the first step in a three year programme of increases which will see Government investment in the child benefit scheme rise by an additional £1 billion by 2003. The dedication of substantial resources to child benefit in Budget 2001 reflects the serious commitment this Government has made to supporting those who are responsible for raising our children.</P>
      <P>In relation to pensions I am also strongly committed to improving the position of people who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives. Measures already introduced, including the reduction in the average number of PRSI contributions required for pension purposes to ten and the extra recognition afforded to pre-53 contributions, are making it easier for people with reduced or broken insurance records to receive a pension.</P>
      <P>While recognising that the social insurance system cannot cover all gaps in pension coverage, nevertheless, as I indicated in my speech on the budget more needs to be done in this area, for example, in relation to the existing system of homemaker disregards. This and other issues, including the cost and administrative implications, will be considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions which will get under way shortly. Another improvement relates to the decision to increase the rate of the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age to the full old age pension rate. A major step towards this objective was taken in budget 2001 by providing an increase of £15 per week in the full rate QAA. Following on the report of the PPF working group examining the issues of administrative individualisation, arrangements will be put in place so that part of the pension can be paid directly to the qualified adult.</P>

      <P>The United Nations has designated the year 2001 as International year of the Volunteer (IYV 2001). The main objectives of the year are the recognition, promotion, facili<Col N="1138" /> tation and networking of volunteering contributions world wide. The International year provides an opportunity to further raise the profile of volunteering in Ireland and progress the Government's policies with regard to development of social capital and encouragement of volunteerism.</P>
      <P>On 5 December 2000, I launched the national committee on volunteering, under the chairmanship of Deputy Chris Flood. This committee has a total membership of 38 and members are drawn from relevant Departments, including my Department, universities with related research or training roles, business and industry, foundations, leading NGOs and community and voluntary groups together with some individuals in their personal capacity.</P>
      <P>To date the national committee has met on three occasions. From the beginning, it was evident to the chairman that the use of sub-committees would be required to ensure the national committee worked effectively and was in a position to complete the ambitious terms of reference set for it. To date, four subcommittees have been established to address specific issues in relation to volunteerism, as follows: IYV 2001 implementation sub-committee is responsible for drafting an action plan for IYV 2001 and for co-ordinating and implementing decisions of the national committee; the grants sub-committee responsible for examining the desirability of operating a grant scheme to mark IYV 2001; the accreditation sub-committee will examine the whole issue of training and accreditation for volunteers and the volunteer awareness/support sub-committee established to develop the awareness of the role which volunteers play in Irish society; to examine measures to widen the pool of volunteers and to look at the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering. Currently, membership of the four sub-committees is drawn from the national committee. However, sub-committees may decide to co-opt outside expertise in relation to certain issues. In particular, the topics being examined by both the training/accreditation and awareness/support sub-committees are very wide ranging and are likely to take some time to complete. Any individual, or groups, wishing to make submissions to the national committee or one of the sub-committees can do so through the Chairman, Deputy Chris Flood, c/o Comhairle, Hume House, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.</P>

      <P>Regulations provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for claimants of certain welfare payments where the spouse or partner of the claimant is earning between £70 and £135 per week.</P>
      <P>The relevant social welfare payments are unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, farm assist, disability benefit, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, injury benefit, unemployability supplement, invalidity pension, retirement pension and old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>In view of the increases in the QAA provided for in this year's budget, it was necessary to extend the range of income over which the QAA is withdrawn to avoid a severe poverty trap. The recent budget therefore provided for an extension of the income range over which the tapering arrangements apply, from the current £70-£135 to £70-£145.</P>
      <P>The level of qualified adult allowance varies from one payment type to another. In order to phase out the payment over the same income range for all payments, the withdrawal rates vary with the level of qualified allowance.</P>
      <P>The new rates of tapered QAA for standard full rate payments are set out hereunder in tabular format. These rates will apply from early April. There are, additionally, various tapered QAA rates which apply to reduced rate benefits.

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £18 million to this scheme, which to the end of 2000 had allowed some 65,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and, accordingly, a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2001.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the purchase and/or installation cost of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks and door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm system which is operated <i>via</i> the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>

    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, funding is available towards the once-off costs of obtaining or installing the relevant equipment. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially monitored alarm systems are not <Col N="1142" /> provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers my Department has no role in setting or abolishing such fees.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend it.</P>

Entitlement to this compensation in respect of commercial operations is established by providing to my Department proof of ownership, vouched income, receipts and audited accounts. A tax clearance certificate must also be made available for inspection. My Department currently has no application from, or on behalf of, the named person for compensation.</P>

      <P>While the site is not closed to the public at present it will be necessary for my Department to undertake essential remedial works to repair damage which resulted from vandalism to the monument in early January. This necessary work will be carried out during the period 5 March to 31 May 2001. For health and safety reasons it will be necessary for the duration of these remedial works to limit access to the site and to this end my Department has applied to Donegal County Council for temporary closure of the access road to the site for the period of the works.</P>
      <P>Conscious that the site is an important one, my Department will ensure that access to the monument is maintained for visitors from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., Monday to Friday and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. In addition, special arrangements will be made to ensure access to the site over St. Patrick's weekend and during Easter.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental review group, chaired by an official from my Department, is currently examining the reliefs available under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme in order to identify any anomalies and to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance. The scheme provides reliefs from vehicle registration tax and value added tax on vehicles and from excise duty on fuel to drivers and passengers who are severely and permanently physically disabled.</P>
      <P>While a sizeable number of submissions had already been made to the group prior to May 2000, the review group placed advertisements in the national newspapers in early May 2000, seeking written submissions from members of the public in order that it would benefit from as full a consultation process as possible. Arising out of the advertisements, 250 submissions were received, reflecting over 60 different disabilities.</P>
      <P>The review group also held 22 individual hearings between May and September 2000 with representatives of various organisations and with a number of persons, who had indicated a desire to make oral submissions to them. At present, the group is examining practice in other countries and certain technical aspects of the scheme. As the group are still deliberating on the issues raised and have undertaken further examination, it is not possible to state what conclusions are likely to emerge. However, the group are conscious of the time and effort which individual members of the public and the relevant associations have put into the submissions and are committed to giving full consideration to the issues raised, as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the review group will report to the Minister for Finance on its work in the coming months.</P>

The Commissioner's functions in this regard are carried out by the Chief Superintendent, Traffic Department, Dublin Castle and I have no role in the matter.</P>
      <P>I understand that a site for parking horse drawn carriages was sought due to the re-introduction of horse drawn carriages onto the streets of Dublin as a tourist attraction. Numerous sites were inspected.

    <P>As I stated in my recent reply to Question <Col N="1146" /> No. 151 on 31 January 2001, there is no legal obligation to have insurance on these vehicles but it is prudent for any business concern to have appropriate insurance cover though this decision is ultimately a matter for the individuals concerned.

      <P>Section 9 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 provides that, where any court makes a maintenance order under that Act, the court shall direct that payments under the order shall be made to a District Court clerk unless the maintenance creditor requests otherwise and the court considers that it would not be proper to so direct. Where payments to the District Court clerk are in arrears, the clerk shall, if requested to do so by the maintenance creditor, take such steps as the clerk considers reasonable to recover the sums in arrears whether by proceeding for an attachment of earnings order or otherwise. Section 10 of the 1976 Act, as amended, provides for the making of an attachment of earnings order in the same proceedings in which a court makes either a maintenance order under that Act or a range of other orders including periodical payments orders on the occasion of divorce or judicial separation.</P>
      <P>Substantial powers are available to enforce maintenance orders. Moreover, the procedures involved are of a summary nature and are designed to keep costs to a minimum.

      <P>I accept there is a need in all areas of the country for schoolchildren to have access to psychological support. My Department is committed to providing such support for all schools and has established the National Educational Psychological Service Agency as an executive agency for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The current situation is that NEPS provides a service to all post-primary schools in County Wicklow. The agency has been actively recruiting additional psychologists and is now embarking on a programme of expansion, particularly in the primary sector. The service to schools in west Wicklow is organised by the NEPS eastern region, the south-western area. Good progress has been made with expansion in this region and I hope a service will be initiated in primary schools in west Wicklow within the year.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and 14 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 413 as at 30 September 1999. The school also has the services of a remedial teacher. The enrolment as at 30 September 2000, on which the staffing for the 2001-2002 school year will be based, was 371.</P>
      <P>However, as the staffing schedule for the 2001-2002 has not yet been finalised, the retention or otherwise of the fourteenth teaching post cannot be determined at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>My approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-2001 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the <Col N="1153" /> CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
    <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. I will consider the appropriate response when I receive the team's report.</P>
    <P>In September 2000, when setting up the action group on access to third level education, I announced, as an initial step pending the findings of the group, the introduction of a special rate of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders. The adjacent and non-adjacent rates announced were £1,000 and £2,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the report of the action group shortly and recommendations relating to the criteria for the special rates of grant are part of that report. A further announcement regarding the special rates of grant will issue when I have fully considered the recommendations presented in the report.</P>

      <P>The demand for teachers is affected by factors such as the number of teaching posts created by the Government, the number of teachers availing of early retirement, career breaks and job-sharing, the number of secondments approved, and the level of requirement for substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, this Government has increased the demand for teachers generally by creating an extra 1,875 posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness this Government has approved the allocation of a further 900 posts to be allocated during the lifetime of the programme. In addition, the allocation of resource posts to meet specific needs in the next five years will increase the demand for teaching posts </P>
      <P>While the demand for teachers has increased arising from Government initiatives to reduce the PTR and allocate additional posts to deal with disadvantage and disabilities, this Government has boosted substantially the supply of trained primary teachers to deal with this additional demand.</P>
      <P>The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 1,000 students enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. It is projected that the intake will continue at 1,000 annually for a num<Col N="1155" /> ber of years. However, these projections will be reviewed on an ongoing basis taking account of enrolment trends and changes in demand requirements.</P>
    <P>As a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers, my Department requested the colleges of education to provide postgraduate courses to enable degree holders train as primary teachers. The duration of the post graduate full-time course is 18 months. Eligible post-primary teachers may apply for this course in the normal way. These courses were provided in the 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 academic years. A further postgraduate course will commence this month with an intake of 280 students.</P>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. It is projected that 1,280 qualified primary teachers will graduate in 2002.</P>
    <P>At second level, the Deputy will be aware that an additional 1,000 posts have been created in the current school year. A proportion of these posts have been utilised to facilitate the reduction in the pupil teacher ratio for appointment purposes from 19:1 to 18:1. The balance has been targeted at particular programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the junior certificate school programme and the stay in school retention initiative. A further 200 posts will be allocated in each of the next three school years in accordance with <Col N="1156" /> the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>These posts, together with the introduction in all second level schools, from September 1999, of enrolment based allocations for remedial teaching and the retention within the system of posts that would otherwise be lost due to falling enrolments, have resulted in the national PTR in the second level sector falling, from just over 16:1 when this Government came into office, to just over 15:1 in the current school year.</P>
    <P>The teacher supply and demand issue at second level is very complex. Analyses undertaken by my Department in 1997 indicated that there are regional and subject variations. Schools in certain locations have more difficulties in recruitment while specific subjects, especially Irish, may pose particular difficulties. A further complicating factor is that vacancies in second level schools usually require specific subject combinations.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Higher Education Authority have been monitoring the situation carefully. The total number of places on the higher diploma in education course has increased by 25% since 1997-98. Quotas were set aside in 1998 for specific subjects, including Irish. The Department and the Higher Education Authority are continuing to review the supply and demand of second level teachers on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any specific difficulty in recruiting teachers to the remedial service. In September 1999, the remedial service was extended to all first and second level schools with a PTR of 10:1 or above. Schools with a lower PTR are entitled to make application for remedial support if they can demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
