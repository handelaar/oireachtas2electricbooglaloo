      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The late sitting represents an extension of time which one would imagine would be occupied with matters of the greatest importance. Not taking from any of the matters ordered, is the Government reflecting on the points that have been made here time and again on the need for a fuller questions and answer style debate on the outcome of the Gothenburg summit? It has not been thought about in government and I would like it to be reflected on. If extra time is to be given to matters, time should be given to debate that matter.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste will be aware that today is World Refugee Day and of the joint calls <Col N="763" /> from IBEC, the Irish Refugee Council and other organisations that refugees and asylum seekers be allowed to work after six months if their applications have not been processed. Would she accept that such a move would help to alleviate the labour shortages in the economy and reduce tensions, suspicions and hostility towards those now on welfare through no fault of their own? Will she mark World Refugee Day by agreeing to change the law on this matter in order that refugees and asylum seekers can have their dignity restored and make a contribution to the economy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call made by Deputy Noonan and the Irish Refugee Council, which today issued a press release to mark World Refugee Day which talks about the right to work and dignity. Can the Tánaiste explain the reason her Department is trying to attract people from other countries to Ireland when there are people here already, many of whom have skills which could be utilised if they were given the right to work? Where stands the Progressive Democrats Party in this coalition Government in relation to the description by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, that the asylum policy of the Government, and its administration of it, is a shambles and in chaos? Will the Tánaiste endorse the call by the Minister of State that asylum seekers who have been here for six months and whose applications have not been dealt with and completed be given the right to work?</P>

      <P>I am interested in accuracy. The Government made a decision in July 1999 which allowed asylum seekers in Ireland at that time for one year the right to work. There were 2,500 asylum seekers, for many of whom FÁS put training programmes in place. Now, 81% of them are working with a further 10% or 11% involved in ongoing training or education. It is important that asylum applications be processed within six months and where that is not done I favour their right to work. However, that would have to be a Government decision and since there are differences within the Government I do not envisage this happening, short of a new mandate. After all, there are four Deputies in my party and I do not have a majority in the Government&mdash;</P>

He went on to say that unless the immigration policy is changed, for which I understand the Tánaiste has primary responsibility, it would cut Ireland's growth at the knees. Is the Tánaiste going to change the manner in which work permits are granted or the manner in which immigrants come to the country in terms of being allowed to work?</P>

      <P>A review of immigration policy is under way to which I will be making an input. I understand the public has until the end of July to make submissions. We are granting an unprecedented number of work permits and have a new working visa. Two years ago we were granting about 6,000 work permits per year. The figure for this year already is 15,000. As I said, last week we received 1,300 applications for work permits, with an average of 1,000 per week, in addition to the working visa under which there are about 3,000 working in the country. In comparison with many other European countries, we have a very progressive and liberal approach to both the working visa regime and work permits.</P>

Following his death, Justice Barron was appointed to undertake that inquiry and has proceeded in that regard. A request was made to the British authorities for co-operation from the British Government in relation to documentation they may have in their files. On 31 May the Justice for the Forgotten group raised with Justice Barron the progress he had made and when he would be able to file his report. He indicated at the time that the British authorities had not complied with requests to provide information, notwithstanding the fact that the Irish Government has sent documentation &ndash; perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will confirm this &ndash; to the Saville Inquiry in relation to the shootings in Derry. Is the Tánaiste aware of this particular problem and whether the Government has raised with the British Government its failure to co-operate with this preliminary inquiry? This is a preliminary inquiry as on the basis of the report a determination will be made whether to hold a full inquiry. What action will the Tánaiste take in the light of the refusal of the British authorities to effectively co-operate?</P>

      <P>Has the information given by Mr. Justice Barron to the group of relatives been discussed in Cabinet? Is the Government taking any steps to make a formal request through diplomatic channels to the British Government to provide the documentation which has been requested?</P>

      <P>I am not aware of what both Deputy Quinn and Deputy Noonan have asked about. I apologise for that but I am certainly not aware that Mr. Justice Barron had made that information available to the Justice for the Forgotten group. I will pursue the matter with both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Justice Barron's committee does not report to the Government. I am not aware of any report from Mr. Justice Barron which has been given to any member of the Government but in view of <Col N="766" /> what Deputies Quinn and Noonan raised here, I will pursue the matter and the Taoiseach may report to the Deputy in the morning or I may get an opportunity later in the day to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Tánaiste was originally consulted by the Taoiseach when both the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton and his successor, Mr. Justice Barron, were appointed. Mr. Justice Barron would report directly to the Department of the Taoiseach. Had she not abolished the office of the Tánaiste, she might have been kept in the loop but since she clearly has not been kept in the loop, she does not know anything about it.</P>
      <P>In January 2000 the British Government was requested to provide this information and has failed to do so. Mr. Justice Barron cannot conclude his report without that co-operation. I take it, now that she has got herself back into the loop as Tánaiste and has informed herself through the courtesy of this House, that she will raise this matter in the appropriate way with the Taoiseach and with the British authorities. Will she agree it is unacceptable that while the Irish Government is co-operating with the Saville inquiry in Northern Ireland providing security documentation and files, the British authorities are not prepared to do likewise?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unacceptable if a friendly neighbouring jurisdiction were not to co-operate in matters of this kind. It is very important, not just for the Justice for the Forgotten group and the families of those who lost their lives in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings but for the country that we bring this inquiry to a successful conclusion. These people had sought an inquiry of this kind for many years.</P>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Quinn, I was consulted, as was the Government about the appointment of the late Mr. Justice Hamilton and the subsequent appointment of his replacement, Mr. Justice Barron. Neither I nor the Government has sought on an ongoing basis to inquire into how that inquiry is going. We hope it can be concluded as quickly as possible. If there are difficulties they will be raised politically as they should be, and I will ensure that that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>For about a decade, the issue of dormant accounts has attracted sporadic attention from Deputies on all sides of this House, as well as media interest in the potential there might be for the State to put these funds to good use. Investigation into the matter raised complex constitutional, legal, operational, prudential and investment considerations &ndash; the right to private property, rights on foot of the Succession Act, 1965 and the State Property Act, 1954, the bank-customer implied contract of confidentiality, and the implication for banks' solvency and liquidity. I also had to consider the public perception impact of introducing such a scheme, and what effect this would have on potential investors both domestically and overseas.</P>
      <P>However, my main concern was that there was not an onus on credit institutions to trace the owners of deposits lodged with them. It was up to clients or their next-of-kin to come looking for their money. The days of personal banking, in which banks' staff knew their clients and notified their dependants in circumstances where the account-holder had died, for instance, have long passed, and no system was in place which guaranteed next-of-kin their rightful inheritance. In addition, there are many instances where people have chosen to remain secretive about their financial affairs, in which cases dependants or next-of-kin have found it impossible to trace the relevant accounts.</P>
      <P>This failure to trace account holders has long been a matter of public conjecture and concern. Demutualisation of the Irish Permanent and First National Building Societies in recent years indicated the extent of the problem. In the Irish Permanent flotation, in 1994, almost half of those people entitled to free shares did not initially take up that offer. However, by the time the process was completed in 1997, and following the extensive advertising campaign, that percentage of non-claimants had fallen to 8% of customers. Nevertheless, this still numbered about 12,000 accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which gave impetus to this reform was that in its Report &ldquo;Parliamentary <Col N="774" /> Inquiry into DIRT&rdquo;, published in 1999, the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) Sub-Committee on Certain Revenue Matters recommended that, as soon as was feasible, legislation should be prepared by me so that funds in dormant accounts could be used for specified purposes to benefit society. The sub-committee considered that the money in these accounts represented &ldquo;free capital&rdquo; for financial institutions in that deposit-takers had free use of these funds &ndash; in effect, that the moneys had become part of the capital base of these institutions. The sub-committee was anxious that the benefit of these funds, which seemed to lie unclaimed for long periods, should accrue to society as a whole, and not just to the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the various factors already mentioned, last November I proposed the outline of a scheme to deal with these dormant accounts. The Government accepted these proposals and gave permission for the legislation to be formally drafted. This proved to be a long and challenging task, as many issues came to light in the drafting process that had not previously been considered. I was aware that the successful development and implementation of the proposed scheme would require the full co-operation of the financial institutions and their representatives, as well as the advice and co-operation of the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency. I am pleased that assistance from all these parties was always forthcoming and was of enormous benefit.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation ventures into uncharted waters. We had no other statutory scheme we could examine for possible pitfalls or which might steer us in the right direction, given the route we wished to take. Nevertheless, what we have provided for in this legislation gives the best and most equitable balance between the rights of account-holders and the desire that neither the credit institutions nor the State should be burdened with an unduly bureaucratic scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill fully addresses the Public Accounts Committee recommendation for the use of the moneys in dormant accounts, in that charities and the community at large will benefit from these moneys once the scheme is operational.</P>
    <P>My Department has attempted to build up an estimate of the amount of dormant funds held in accounts with the credit institutions on the basis of information supplied by the banks, building societies and An Post. After much discussion of the parameters, the institutions agreed to supply information relating to the number and value of deposit accounts which had been &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; for various periods of time, including those dormant for 15 years. An Post also supplied relevant information relating to savings bonds, savings certificates and instalment savings schemes.</P>
    <P>In the end, a period of 15 years dormancy, that is, where there has been no customer-initiated transaction on an account for at least 15 years, was decided upon. This was mainly in consideration of the fact that a lesser period might cause <Col N="775" /> disquiet among account holders and lead to an inordinately high level of reactivation of accounts with consequent and unnecessary administrative work for all parties concerned. I was also aware that 15 years is the shortest defined period for dormancy in the EU.</P>
    <P>Given a period of dormancy of 15 years, I was advised that the number of such accounts could be in excess of 840,000 and their value could be of the order of £130 million. However, these figures are still only estimates of the amount of money involved. They do not take account of the likely level of reactivations once the institutions in question bring the proposed scheme to the attention of their customers. Nevertheless, they represent the institutions' best estimate to date, and provided enough of a reason for me to pursue my stated aim of bringing forward proposals to deal with these accounts.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the Government's decision that the scheme, once in place, should also apply to mature, but unclaimed life assurance policies. I do not intend to talk about this today, except to say that I am still pursuing this matter with the insurance industry, and intend to bring forward proposals to deal with the matter later this year. What I propose in the current Bill is more modest than the Government originally envisaged, but more achievable. It makes for a good start on the issue of dealing with funds long neglected by owners, and will certainly help to establish the basic framework within which to deal with other dormant products.</P>
    <P>The Government also agreed that officials from my Department should continue to hold talks with the Irish League of Credit Unions with a view to reaching agreement on a formal basis, for the treatment of dormant accounts in credit unions. Such discussions are ongoing. I hope we can provide for inclusion of dormant credit union accounts at a later date, possibly by way of extension of the current scheme by ministerial regulation.</P>
    <P>The scheme I am now proposing, to come into effect on 1 April next year, will provide a legislative framework which will improve regulation with regard to handling and management funds in dormant accounts in credit institutions. It will require those institutions to actively take all reasonable steps to identify the beneficial owners of such funds, with a view to at least alerting them to the existence of those funds, or even repayment if the customer so desires. In the event that the owner or owners cannot be traced, dormant funds will be taken into the care of the State, with a right being guaranteed to the beneficial owner to subsequently seek a refund. The moneys will be held in a separate fund to be established by the National Treasury Management Agency, whose remit will be to invest the moneys prudently, especially given the possibility of claimants seeking a return of their moneys at a later date.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing the introduction of a scheme for the disbursement of surplus dormant <Col N="776" /> funds for the benefit of charities and the community at large. The purposes for which this money may be disbursed are set out in section 41. Broadly speaking, the projects or programmes to benefit will be those designed to alleviate poverty or social deprivation, or to assist those who are physically disadvantaged. The legislation also provides that moneys currently vesting in the intestate estates fund deposit account may be transferred, henceforth, to the dormant accounts fund, on foot of an amendment to the State Property Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the key principles I have enshrined in the legislation establishing the dormant accounts scheme. While I am bringing forward the framework legislation, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will have the primary ministerial responsibility for the scheme once it is up and running, especially for the disbursement aspects. I am very conscious that the moneys with which we are dealing derive, in the main, from private bank and building society accounts and that, as such, they must be handled and invested prudently, having regard to the constitutionally guaranteed right to private property and the confidential nature of the relationship the credit institutions enjoy with their customers. My concern that customers should be reunited with their moneys, including all interest due thereon, is reflected in four key features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>First, the term &ldquo;dormancy&rdquo; will now be statutorily defined, and therefore be applied uniformly by all institutions which fall within the ambit of the scheme. This will provide clarity for customers, in that they can be certain that if they have not carried out any transaction on their accounts for 15 years or more, as and from 31 March next year, the money in the account is due to be dealt with in a defined manner. This should also encourage account holders to make contact with their bank or building society to ascertain whether they do have an account at that institution.</P>
    <P>Second, the institutions in question will now be required to make best efforts to contact their customers. This may be done in one of two ways. For customers whose accounts are valued at or above 100, banks and building societies will be required to personally contact those account holders, making them aware of the scheme and their rights and obligations under it. For accounts valued below 100, as well as for so-called &ldquo;non-correspondence&rdquo; accounts, notification will be by way of advertisement in two or more national daily newspapers. Non-correspondence accounts are those in regard to which the account holder has requested that no correspondence be sent to his or her home address, or where correspondence sent to an address has been returned to the credit institution. These annual advertisements, the first of which is scheduled to take place in April next year, will generate public awareness of the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> Third, the legislation provides that the National Treasury Management Agency will establish and manage a dormant accounts fund, into which moneys from dormant accounts will be transferred from April 2003. The agency will be required to invest these moneys prudently, based on guidelines which I will help to draw up, but having regard to the need to meet the costs of making repayments to valid claimants seeking a return of their moneys. The main issue here is that not only is a claimant entitled to a return of the principal transferred from his or her account, but also to any interest that he or she would have been due on that principal, had the account remained with the institution. The moneys in the fund will generate an investment income, some of which will be used to offset the costs of interest payments to claimants, and the rest of which will be reapplied to the fund. In that way, account holders are guaranteed the maintenance of their rights.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the legislation will give the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs authority to appoint not only the members of the disbursements board, but also inspectors for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the scheme on the part of the institutions. These inspectors, who will essentially be professional accountants hired on contract, will be empowered to examine the systems and practices which an institution employs to see if the systems are adequate for the purposes of identifying and notifying the holders of dormant accounts. They will also ascertain whether all moneys due to be transferred to the dormant accounts fund have been transferred and properly recorded.</P>
    <P>Turning to the main provisions of the Bill, in summary, it provides for identification of the types of accounts and institutions to be covered by the scheme; the period of dormancy applying; the obligations of the institutions in relation to notification of account holders that their accounts may be deemed dormant; the establishment of a dormant accounts fund to be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency and the procedure, including the timeframe, within which moneys are to be transferred to that fund; the rights of share account holders, in building societies, on foot of the legislation; a new recording procedure to be adopted by the credit institutions in relation to the holders of dormant accounts; the introduction of a scheme whereby institutions will be obliged to complete certificates of compliance with the provisions of the legislation, in order that any failure on the part of institutions can be quickly identified; a new role of inspector, whose remit will be to check compliance with the legislation on the part of the institutions; amendment of the State Property Act, 1954, in order that moneys from the intestate estates fund deposit account can, henceforth, be transferred to the dormant accounts fund; the appointment by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, whose remit will be to disburse <Col N="778" /> moneys from the dormant accounts fund, for specified purposes, on receipt of successful applications for such; accountability of the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, and the chairperson of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board, to the Committee of Public Accounts, for the functions of the agency and the board respectively, including provision for annual reports from each of those bodies; maintenance of confidentiality in relation to ownership of the moneys in dormant accounts; and extension of the scheme to other classes of product and/or other classes of institution, at a later date, by ministerial regulation.</P>
    <P>While the Bill does not purport to address all the issues or provide for a complete solution to the issue of dormant accounts, it make an ambitious start. It enables us to begin to provide for a systematic approach to the regulation of these accounts, in the strive for transparency of their treatment, as well as providing for an equitable and socially beneficial use of any surplus moneys identified. The Bill is innovative legislation and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which was proposed by the Committee of Public Accounts in its DIRT inquiry report, which I chaired. I am mystified at the song and dance the Minister is making about it. The Government is being much too reluctant to address this issue and I am astonished that it considers 15 years to be the appropriate period to wait before securing a dormant account. I favour a much shorter period, perhaps seven years.</P>
      <P>In response to queries from the Committee of Public Accounts the Minister gave figures for different time spans. If a period of 20 years was allowed to elapse, a total of £53.6 million would be secured; a period of 15 years would yield £139.5 million; ten years would yield £402.6 million and five years would yield £1.75 billion. These are astonishing sums and they do not even include prize bonds.</P>
      <P>The Minister is effectively saying that this legislation is good for the banks but not for the prize bond funds. I speculate that there is approximately £100 million of dormant prize bonds. It is an act of partisanship on behalf of the Government and the Minister not to include them. I will also press him to treat dormant Government funds equally with other funds in building societies etc. The Bill does not cover dormant or unclaimed insurance policies which I hope will be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial institutions take great advantage of the inertia of their customers. This applies not only to long forgotten bank accounts but also to current funds. In a submission to the Committee of Public Accounts the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency said that while he looked after the national finances, he was very poor at looking after his own. I well identify with this. Many others are in a similar position. The banks make a killing on a daily and <Col N="779" /> annual basis because of the inertia of their customers. The dormant accounts represent an advanced form of inertia, yet this legislation proposes to allow the financial institutions to have free use of them for a period of 15 years. While I accept that this is the shortest period in similar EU legislation &ndash; France has provision for a similar period &ndash; it is far too long. If there has been no activity involving the owner of an account for seven years, why should it not be taken into the dormant accounts fund given that any owner or legal heir can reclaim the funds with interest?</P>
    <P>I am also puzzled by the Minister's view that a disbursement board should be established. This is overkill because there is a precedent for the fund in the Funds of Suitors Acts under which unclaimed money that had been lodged in the courts was used for specific purposes in the past. A board was not set up to disburse that money, although the amounts involved were much smaller. I recall one case where £2 million to £3 million of suitors' funds was dedicated to the refurbishment of the Kings Inns building. The disbursement fund suggested by the Minister has all the hallmarks of another slush fund to be used like the national lottery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will be appointed by the Minister. If it is anything like the Aer Lingus board, it will be like a Fianna Fáil cumann. Aer Lingus is in a mess and it is effectively presided over by a Fianna Fáil cumann. When I was the Minister in the Departments of Posts and Telegraphs and Transport and Communications, I tried to move away from the party politicisation of boards because it was ruining the State sector. However, under the Bill, most of the board members will be appointed by the Minister with one nominee from outside. It is an unnecessary board.</P>
      <P>In making its proposals in this area, the Committee of Public Accounts wanted the money spent on social needs and the Minister referred to that aspect. It should be narrowed down to two areas; the money should be spent on primary education and on the elderly. The number of young people who leave primary school with learning difficulties is alarmingly high. It is four times the level in Finland and it means that three quarters of the children who leave primary school with learning difficulties are embarking on a life of disadvantage that could be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary education should be the first priority. Resources are now available and they should be poured into providing extra remedial teachers, psychologists, home school liaison arrangements <Col N="780" /> and family back up services. It need not be the case that three out of every four children leave primary school with learning difficulties and embark on lives of disadvantage. This problem has gone on for too long and this fund could be specifically targeted at this area. This would prevent the money being used as a slush fund. It would also be a great service to those individuals, their families and society as a whole. Many of those children end up in prison; 80% of people in prison left school with learning difficulties and they are semi-literate or illiterate. Half the fund should be used in this area.</P>
    <P>The other half of the fund should be dedicated to the elderly, many of whom may be unaware that they own dormant accounts. People are living longer and there is a need for a dramatically enhanced provision for the care of the elderly. Many people end up living lonely lives in over-large houses that are in poor repair and which they cannot afford to keep. Such people are cold, worried and insecure while many others end up in nursing homes when they need not. The country now has the resources to match the vision in this area. Villages for elderly people should be built in every community. They would include a nursing home as well as private bungalows or apartments. This would ensure that elderly people could remain in their communities and have security.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, particularly in Dublin, have done a great job with regard to accommodation for the elderly. However, my concept is wider and involves a village where a nursing home is located beside private accommodation for the elderly. People could use the common facilities, such as washing machines and the chiropodist and hairdressing services, but also maintain their independence. This process would ensure that extra housing became available. Many individuals occupy over-large houses and, in the right circumstances, they might be prepared to move a smaller bungalow in their own community.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to address these two specific areas, but a board is unnecessary. There would be bureaucracy and overhanging costs if a board was involved. However, if my proposals were adopted, there would be tangible gains from dormant accounts. The Bill proposes a board that will invest the funds. It will allocate £100,000 to one project and £10,000 to another proposal. The money will be mixed up with lottery and departmental funds and nobody will know the difference. I recognise that my proposal is radically different from the Bill and would lead to a significant restructuring of the legislation, but I plead with the Minister, who is an innovative thinker, to consider making major changes between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not appear to address the duty of financial institutions to try to locate owners of accounts. I raised the issue of dormant accounts a couple of years ago and made a song and dance about it. Later, I walked into a branch of a bank to lodge a cheque &ndash; my account was in another <Col N="781" /> branch &ndash; and the sprightly bank manager came out to tell me with glee that I had a dormant account in that branch. I had forgotten about the account which contained a few hundred pounds. I had been in and out of the bank on many occasions previously and they knew where I lived, but no attempt had ever been made to contact me.</P>
    <P>The banks are being deliberately inert in relation to dormant accounts. They have used the money and their approach is to allow sleeping dogs lie. It is another example of their bad corporate citizenship. We saw in the DIRT inquiry how poor they are as corporate citizens and, regrettably, the spots have not changed. They still have huge offshore tax saving accounts, particularly in the Isle of Man, which, to a significant extent, are used to assist tax evasion. This is another sign of bad corporate citizenship. Banks make no attempt to track down the owners of accounts.</P>
    <P>The Bill should include a provision that would require financial institutions to make contact with an account owner if there has been no activity on an account for a year to find out if it should be continued. There is not an onus or requirement on the banks or the financial institutions to do so. There are many organisations such as political parties, sports organisations or those such as St. Vincent de Paul or the Legion of Mary that have a wide network of branches. These branches come and go and some lapse, so the ownership of the account is really the national organisation. Where a local branch of an organisation has become defunct but the national organisation is still up and running, permission should be given for the remission of those accounts to the organisation headquarters. Fianna Fáil headquarters might get an unexpected bonus from this suggestion. I suspect that all our parties would get a few bob out of it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that over the years election accounts have been opened and left with a few bob and cumann are set up and then lapse or somebody dies and the account is forgotten about. I ask that on Committee Stage provision be made that where a local account holder ceases to be active, and the parent body of an account holder is known to exist that it should be entitled to the proceeds of the account. There should be some safeguards for remittance back to headquarters should the local account be resurrected, rather than to a dormant fund. I am sure a great many church organisations are in this category also.</P>

      <P>What the Minister said in his speech is different to the figure given to the Committee of Public Accounts. There are 840,000 dormant bank accounts of 15 years or more with about £130 million in them. That works out at a relatively small amount of money, £150 on average. I am sure that is an accurate figure. I would like the Minister to take on board that where the account holder is affiliated to a larger organisation, the larger organisation would be entitled to have the funds transferred to it and that provision be included in the Bill to that effect on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to harp on too much about the banks, but as Chairman of the DIRT inquiry I was taken aback at their indifferent approach to ethics and their duty to the public. For years I did not check my bank account &ndash; not that I have much in it. Occasionally, if one sits down in August, for example, when there is less pressure, one does find that charges have been made which should not have been. I have always operated on the basis that one can trust the banks as they depend on public confidence, but my view has been completely changed. This is not just because of the DIRT inquiry but also because of their inactivity and inertia with regard to dormant accounts. They have known about them for many years and have let them lie so they can use the money.</P>
      <P>Another factor is the astonishing number of funds on deposit in Irish banks in the Isle of Man alone. From reading the newspapers we know how many of those before the tribunals have accounts in the Isle of Man. We also know from the DIRT inquiry that people were referred by the managers of these banks, up to quite a recent date, to the Isle of Man. We know that the Isle of Man accounts are still there. I know that there may be good and legitimate reasons for the accounts being in the Isle of Man, but does that mean they should also have this facility whereby the financial institutions are inert about observing tax evasion to say the least? I make no apologies for still being very sceptical about the banks having changed their spots. There is enough evidence to suggest that they have not, that there is still a culture that needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we confine ourselves to the 15 years proposal, we have £130 million to invest by the disbursement board fund. Overheads will have to be taken from the proceeds of that investment and by the time we get any money to invest in the needy it will be a very small amount. I am very disappointed with the proposals in the Bill for that reason. I would prefer to see the Exchequer take on this responsibility. It gives two defined purposes and is additional to what is already provided for. The principle of additionality is important and that there is a guarantee as in the funds of suitors case, that the money will be returned by the Exchequer should the true owners be found. I urge the Minister to think about this substantial change to the Bill for Committee Stage. If he is willing to go down that road <Col N="783" /> he will find that on this side of the House we will facilitate the speedy passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the seven years proposal were accepted we would be talking about £1 billion being available. That would do a great deal for the elderly and for primary education. We do not have precise figures for seven years, but for four years it is £402 million, and for five years it is £1,739 million.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Jim Mitchell I could not help reflecting that in bygone years people on these benches might have welcomed this Bill as a first stage toward the nationalisation of the banks. I suppose we are not in that sort of game anymore.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is overdue and broadly speaking it hits the right spot in terms of what we are seeking to do. Some Deputies in this House have talked about this issue for years. I note that Deputy O'Keeffe of Fine Gael has talked about it for years. It came to prominence in the context of the Public Accounts Committee report last year. I looked at the Public Accounts Committee report and am aware of some of the discussions to which Deputy Jim Mitchell refers. There is a significant discordance between the various figures that have been given. Some figures have been given to the Committee of Public Accounts, others by the Minister here today and yet further figures have been given by the Irish Bankers' Federation.</P>
      <P>One thing is clear from all those different figures which are quite different. It is that there is a significant amount of money on deposit after 15 years and a significant amount of money on deposit for the various time frames that they pick. The principle has to be, at what point do we decide that somebody has effectively forgotten about an account or is not aware of an account? I am not sure that we should look at a time span of the order of seven years &ndash; my preference would be to go for a longer period.</P>
      <P>All of the figures that have been given to the Public Accounts Committee by the Minister today and by the Irish Bankers' Federation, suggest that there is still a significant degree of reactivation between ten and 15 years. On balance, the 15 year period may be about right. I wish to enter an important caveat, that the information is uncertain and in some ways actually contradictory. If it transpires that in fact those figures are wrong, then this is something that may need to be looked at again.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Bill does allow the Minister at some point in the future, without coming back to the House, to redefine the dormancy period. I am not sure that it is a positive development. I would like to have seen the power to define the dormancy period kept in this House. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is about two things. First it is about putting an obligation on banks to maintain contact with customers and to re-establish contact with customers with whom they have lost contact. <Col N="784" /> Second, it is about providing what happens in circumstances where we can be reasonably satisfied that somebody has irrevocably forgotten about an account or where there is a lesser likelihood or a diminished likelihood that they will ever look to reclaim it. I agree entirely with Deputy Mitchell that the emphasis should really be on the first point, that is, the duty of the bank to maintain contact with customers. Once upon a time if you had a deposit account you invariably got a deposit book and that at least provided some evidence, for example in the case of death, which allowed people to establish that you had an account. It also provided the customer with evidence that an account existed. Nowadays that is not the norm. Most people work on a statements only basis and some banks do not even provide statements on a regular basis. It is perfectly possible for years to elapse without the bank corresponding in any way with customers. This is not acceptable. We should treat this as being the base point and establish in the Bill a duty on the banks to correspond with or notify customers formally on a regular basis to inform them of the state of their accounts. It would not be unreasonable to expect a bank to notify customers on a yearly or two yearly basis that they have an account and what the balance of the account is.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the structure for notification in the Bill is exactly the right one. The Minister has chosen a cut-off point of 100, below which it will not be necessary for banks to correspond directly or individually with customers. Since this is new legislation and we are setting up a new framework, it would not be unreasonable to ask the banks or to insist that banks should communicate with virtually all of their customers and I would certainly have picked a significantly lower cut-off point for correspondence than the 100 which is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would have picked a relatively nominal figure such as 20 or 30, at least in the first instance. Banks would then be required to effectively communicate with most of the customers on their database. Much of this could be avoided by having a significant advertising campaign in advance of notification. The advertising campaign would bring a certain number of queries and it could be taken from there. The Bill should contain a positive duty on banks to correspond on a regular basis with their customers and to notify them that the accounts exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke at some length about the disbursement board. I have read the Bill and the explanatory memorandum and listened to the Minister, and I am still very confused as to how exactly this will work. I am confused about the division between the disbursement and investment fund and the reserve fund and how the money in the disbursement and the investment fund is to be divided as between investments and disbursements. There is an obligation on the NTMA to invest money in a method that is defined in the Bill. There is a duty and a facility given to the disbursement board to spend money. <Col N="785" /> At no point in the Bill is it set out just exactly what is to be invested and what is to be spent nor, that I can see, is there a mechanism set out how this is to be determined at any stage in the future. I am frankly confused how it is intended that it should happen. The only provision I can see is that which allows that if a reserve fund is depleted, it can be topped up from the disbursement fund. That is the only provision I see which relates to the balances between the various funds and the ways in which the fund is to be used.</P>
    <P>Perhaps of more importance in terms of the deliberations in this House is how the moneys are to be used when they are disbursed. Section 41 of the Bill is very loose in its definition. It says in two or three sentences that it is to be used for reasons of social inclusion. I agree with Deputy Mitchell that we need to go a little further in defining that. My view is that now and for the foreseeable future, any additional funds that become directly or indirectly available to the Exchequer should be spent on health related matters. An area of health care which has been largely neglected and under-funded, such as disabilities, mental handicap and special needs, should be targeted rather than the money used in the general health fund. The money needs to be ringfenced in a much more clear-cut fashion so that people know that the money is being used in a particular way.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a little confused and confusing as to the mechanism for deciding how the money is to be spent. The board will be there to make the decisions but, on the other hand, the Minister can effectively direct the board on how to use its discretion. The Minister's consent is required if more than 300,000 is spent on a particular project. I am not convinced that the balance between the Minister making the decision and giving the board discretion is correct. It is not very clear in the Bill where exactly the balance falls.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the banks have the capacity to undertake the notification as required. The IBF position is that if I as a customer were to telephone my local bank branch in the morning and say that I had an account at some point in the past, the bank would be able to tell me relatively quickly whether I had or not and what the balance was in the account. I am sceptical about that. For instance, I think I may have an account in the Bank of Ireland branch in Belfield, with very little money in it, which dates back about 20 years. I may be incorrect but I am not altogether persuaded that if I telephone the Belfield branch that its paper records from 20 years ago are going to be sufficiently good to tell me that I have a balance in that account. I ask the Minister for some reassurance, and I assume his officials have dealt with the banks on an individual basis, that the banks' information technology is good enough to go back over 15 years and more to be able to give the information that is required. The IBF says that it operates a system whereby, for example, if solicitors acting on behalf of the estate of a deceased person wish, a trawl of <Col N="786" /> records can be instituted and details of accounts held in the name of the deceased person can be provided. I wonder how well that procedure works and how much it is used and whether the Minister or his officials have inquired from the banks as to how often there are requests of that kind and to what extent the banks can respond positively to those requests. From experience, I am not sure it works as well as it might.</P>
    <P>It may not be entirely palatable to many people, but there is a means to ensure that all of this edifice was not necessary and that it is to provide people with a personal identity number, as is the case in other European countries. Members will recall that a few weeks ago this House passed the Finance Bill which has provisions that require people when opening a special savings scheme account to supply their public service number. This allows the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that each individual has only one account. The principle and the precedent is set in terms of providing a public service number when opening a bank account. We should encourage the provision of the number as a voluntary act. I suspect there would not be a general welcome in this country if people were compulsorily required to give the RSI number when opening an account. It would be reasonable to suggest that banks should invite people to give their number. The reason is that generally speaking people will be within the State system in some form, either they will be drawing a pension or will be within the tax system, and the State will be in a position to contact them or will know if they are deceased.</P>
    <P>However, it is not unknown for people to continue to draw a pension on their behalf after they die but it is unusual and the State would have a good record and the capacity to get in contact with people. Perhaps in time to come that is the way we need to proceed. I am conscious of the reluctance here to go down what is seen to be the Big Brother road but, nonetheless, it is a way of avoiding the particular difficulty in which we find ourselves and which we are trying to deal with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another issue which inevitably arises in the context of dealing with the banks and the way banks deal with their customers is the whole business of consumer rights. This matter was dealt with in the McDowell report which recommended the setting up of the single financial regulator. I believe there should be a branch of the Director of Consumer Affairs which will be transferred within the regulator which deals with complaints against financial institutions. I am conscious of the fact that there is already a voluntary ombudsman system within the financial institutions. My view is that self-regulation is not ultimately desirable. Given the importance of banks and the importance of each of our relationships with our banks there should be an independent system. Clearly the way in which to work in an independent system would be within the single regulator and the consumer arm of the single regulator. That is an issue on which we need to move.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> The Bill provides for the transfer of the intestacy fund to the new dormant accounts fund. This is an issue about which I know very little. I am aware that where there is no next of kin that money escheats to the State. I am interested to know how much money is within this fund, the rules and regulations for dealing with it, whether that money is dealt with and how much it is expected to take into the dormant accounts fund from the intestacy fund.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we have found it possible to deal with this matter. There was doubt for a number of years whether it could be dealt with appropriately. Clearly the political will to deal with it has been found, no doubt given a spur by the Committee of Public Accounts. While there are issues that need to be dealt with on Committee Stage I welcome the principle of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with my colleagues. I shall be brief. I wish to contribute because dormant accounts is an issue in which I have been interested for the past ten years. At one stage I ran a one man campaign to get a dormant accounts Bill. I am delighted to see the culmination of that campaign. I appreciate that in the meantime others have been involved and the influence of the Committee of Public Accounts was hugely important in stimulating the Bill. I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, with whom I had a number of jousts on this issue in the past, confirmed at all stages his interest in finding a solution to this problem. Undoubtedly there was a problem. The problem began for me when a number of my professional colleagues in the legal world pointed out the difficulties they had in tracing accounts particularly on the death of some of their clients. This was especially difficult when there were no close relations. It was highlighted to me on a number of occasions that they had enormous difficulty getting in the assets and tracing them and in many instances inquiries to financial institutions did not bring a comprehensive response. The result was that in some of those instances moneys were left in the banks unaccounted for and not included in the response to solicitors' inquires about those estates. That is what originally stimulated my interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just one major point to make on the Bill. I always took the view that the moneys involved belonged to the depositors or the investors and at all times that has to be the central approach in dealing with this issue. I note there is much <Col N="788" /> debate about what is to be done with the moneys when taken over by the State. I hold a firm view that first and foremost any such moneys should be returned to the depositor or the next kin of the depositor or the next of kin of those entitled to it. I was not happy with the steps being taken by most of the financial institutions in this regard. Over the years I have had discussions with the Irish Bankers' Federation on the issue. It was suggested to me at the time that the amounts involved were of nominal proportions, a couple of million pounds was mentioned at one stage. It was also pointed out that there were difficulties about confidentiality from the point of view of notifications, etc. I am convinced those difficulties can be overcome.</P>
    <P>I hope what will be followed through thereafter is an acceptance that an account, be it dormant or otherwise, is owned by a person or persons and that the primary obligation must be to try to ensure that that account is returned to the person rightfully entitled thereto or their next of kin. Every reasonable effort must be made to ensure that happens. I accept that thereafter if the account is classified as dormant and is escheated to the State as a consequence, there must be the right of refund later, as provided for in the Bill. I am satisfied with that. I am pleased that at long last the Dormant Accounts Bill is before the House. I hope the emphasis I have put on giving every man his due and returning to depositors, as far as possible or the person entitled, their moneys will be the central approach in the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

      <P>Just to clarify the position. Deputy O'Keeffe is sharing time with Deputies McGrath and Timmins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The bringing forward of the Dormant Accounts Bill is important. It is a subject which has been discussed at various times. The inclusion of a statement from the Committee of Public Accounts that these accounts should be looked into provoked some controversy and discussion around the country. To an extent I am disappointed to hear that dormant accounts, which are more than 15 years old, represent only £130 million. It seems a relatively small amount. In his contribution the Minister said there are 840,000 dormant accounts. This means that the average amount in those accounts is £150, which is relatively small. It is easy to understand that people put aside a few pounds, moved bank or went to a different institution or opened another account and forgot about the few pounds in the other account. It is possible they assumed interest was accruing on it but the institutions have not added interest to it to any great extent. Given that the average amount is £150, to put into the Bill that an account shall only be deemed a dormant account if it is more than 100 is wrong, because 100 is equal to about £80. That is more than 50% of the average size of accounts. If that is done many of the dormant accounts will be <Col N="789" /> excluded. If they are not touched and taken into account by this board, they will lie there and be of use to the banks and financial institutions <i>ad infinitum.</i>The 100 cut-off point has to be drastically reduced. I know the institutions will claim that it will cost them too much money. However, they have all done reasonably well in recent times and they will just have to bear the cost because they have been gaining the value from them. I propose that the 100 cut-off point be reduced; I do not know what a reasonable figure is but it certainly should be in the bottom quadrant of the average account. In a graph of average accounts it should be in the bottom 10%. This would give a cut-off point of 25 to 30.</P>
      <P>There is another item missing from this Bill. There should be an obligation on financial institutions to communicate with account holders on a regular basis. They do not do so because it costs them money. Only quite recently, it was brought to my attention that I had a small account that I had forgotten about. I think there was only £60 in it. It was lying there for 12 or 14 years and would probably fall into this category of being a dormant account. I had totally forgotten and had not been getting annual statements to say that it was there. I was checking something else and, by chance, I discovered it. There should be an obligation on financial institutions to send out annual or bi-annual statements to people in relation to all accounts held in their names. Now is the ideal time to put that obligation on them.</P>
      <P>With the publication of this Bill and the far-reaching effects it will have, there must also be an obligation on the financial institutions to launch an advertising campaign to inform people that this legislation is coming through and dormant accounts that are there for 15 years or more may well be taken over and given to the State. This may well jog people's memories and they can root in the drawer to find an account book they might have forgotten about.</P>
      <P>In many cases, people know they have these small accounts and are leaving them for a rainy day. When this was first mooted, a lady approached me saying that she hoped we would not take the money that her mother and she had in the post office for a long time gathering interest. She said that she had not done anything with it because it was put aside for a rainy day. The institutions must advertise and they have an onus to find the owner of the account.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about establishing a board to disburse these moneys. I am concerned about how much of the money they will use up and how they will assess projects. We have a Civil Service that is well able to do that. It is possible that this can be done without establishing a new level of bureaucracy. Let us identify a small number of projects that should benefit from it and leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned health services and I can see a great need for additional funding in the health services. However, I have severe res<Col N="790" /> ervations about any of these funds being used in substitution for Government obligations. This has happened with lottery funds already, which in one case were used to build a primary school. It is outrageous that lottery funds should be used in substitution for mainline Government spending. These funds should be additional. The suggestions made by Deputy Mitchell that these funds be used for the elderly and perhaps in primary education are good. Primary education is the one level of education that everybody in the State gets and unfortunately it is grossly under-funded. I am sure the Minister and Deputy Byrne, go into primary schools in their constituency and sometimes it is not such a pleasant experience to see the condition of the buildings. Many of them are in need of painting and small things to make the building more pleasant for people to learn in and work in.</P>

      <P>I generally welcome this Bill. It has been a long time coming. However, I regret that the scope of it is very limited and I see for example that the Minister talks about pursuing certain aspects of it with the insurance industry. It would appear that the Department has found that it is not legally correct to include that aspect of it in this Bill. Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the fact that he was a lone campaigner on this for ten years and perhaps he was. I had a primary school teacher and his great quotation was:</P>
      <P>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</P>
      <P>And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</P>
      <P>I feel a bit like that. There is one aspect that is not covered in this Bill and it is something I have raised before. I am glad the Minister is back and he is probably thinking that he is tired of hearing this from Deputy Timmins. However, it is very important to reiterate it because I seem to be the only one concerned about the significance of it. It is the issue of the bank drafts. In his discussion with the insurance industry, I hope the Minister will go back to the banks and try to tease out this issue of bank drafts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man or woman who puts cash in a biscuit tin under the bed has a more sophisticated counterpart who got a bank draft for his biscuit tin. Often the bank draft will be made payable to cash. Banks claim that they do not issue such drafts but one or two of them have surfaced at the tribunals. He would place the bank draft under his bed and as time passed he might die or just forget about it. In the bank, there is a record of the bank draft, let us call it X117, marked out to Mr. Pat <Col N="791" /> McCreevy of Sallins or wherever. The bank will make a return of that bank draft over a long period of time. I am given to understand there are uncashed bank drafts going back 50 or 60 years that have not ever been claimed. I ask the Minister to write to the banks asking for a breakdown of the uncashed bank drafts.</P>
    <P>In addition to the person with cash under the bed, there are people who may have obtained money by not wholly legal means. They may also use the bank draft as a means of hiding money. I imagine there is a significant amount of this money there. Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned that his profession was trying to establish what accounts were held in banks and Deputy McDowell is probably familiar with this.</P>
    <P>A solicitor may be doing the probate of a will or, if there is no will, trying to determine what assets a person had. I am given to understand that when a solicitor contacts the bank, it will send back information on deposit accounts, current accounts etc., but it never sends back information on the bank draft accounts. Almost a year ago I spoke about this on a radio programme and unfortunately I had not anticipated that the presenter would not be as enlightened as I was. That presenter &ndash; he shall remain nameless &ndash; had some difficulty getting around the issue. He put it to me that the onus was on the person who had the bank draft to go in; the bank cannot go chasing them. He equated a bank draft to having a gold bar, but this is not so. If a person gives in a gold bar he will get money, so there are two items of value, the cash and the gold bar. When a person has a banker's draft there is only one item of value, the cash that is in the bank and the draft just gives someone the right to go in and claim the money. Following that programme I was approached by several people.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a time when banks had a good relationship with their customers and would inform the next-of-kin of a deceased person how much money was in the account. One bank employee told me of a situation in a rural community where the holder of a very large bank draft had passed on and the bank manager was concerned to avoid drawing the attention of his head office to his action in facilitating the next-of-kin. I suggest that the Minister should write to the banks and ask them how much they have in uncashed bank drafts and if they are aware of deceased holders of such drafts. They may well say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but I suggest that in some cases they are aware.</P>
    <P>I also draw attention to the issue of items being deposited for safe keeping. For example, if the McGrath family from Mullingar are going away for the weekend, they may be concerned that their house might be broken into. They collect up the family silver and the gold watch commemorating 20 years in politics, or whatever, and deposit them in the bank. On their return, they may decide to leave the items in the bank for safe keeping. Such items are of no benefit to the bank <Col N="792" /> but I understand that, in one instance, a Dublin bank which is changing location has two or three rooms full of items for safe keeping. A former bank employee has told me that one bank where she worked in the mid-1980s had an item owned by Charles Stewart Parnell still lying unclaimed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly love letters. Items which are of no benefit to the bank could be of great historical significance. Coincidentally, another former bank employee informed me that he had worked in a bank which had been a branch of the former Hibernian Bank, in which Charles Stewart Parnell once had an account. My informant had seen letters from Parnell to his agent about his business with the bank at the time. There are undoubtedly many such items of historical interest lying in bank vaults around the country. While they are of no monetary value to the banks, an effort should be made to address this issue from a purely historical point of view.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that where there is money lying in a bank, it will be put into a fund and the family of the deceased owner can make a case and, if they establish their legal claim, they will get the money. Undeniably, there have been certain sharp practices in banks. Anybody who has been surprised by this in recent years has been rather naive. It has been happening quite widely and almost seems to have been socially acceptable.</P>

      <P>In cases where individuals may have opened accounts in a name other than their own, to disguise the identity of the account holder, I do not know what is the legality of ownership of the money in such situations. If it is regarded as a contract between the individual and the bank but is actually an illegal transaction, then there may be no contract and I do not know how the family of such a person may be able to establish a claim.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Mitchell's point on the possible allocation of funds towards educational purposes, a report is currently being compiled by the Minister for Education and Science on people suffering from dyslexia. That is a serious problem which results in people ending up in prison and experiencing major social difficulties. I share Deputy McGrath's view that those funds should not be given to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to dish out in a thousand different directions. Perhaps the funds should be channelled to the education system, including in particular people who suffer from dyslexia. I look forward to the Minister writing to the banks on the issues to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I have asked about this legislation many times on the Order of Business. This issue was referred to in a recommendation from a sub-committee of the Public Accounts Committee and a newspaper report mentioned a possible figure of over £170 million lying in dormant accounts. The Minister mentioned an estimated figure of £130 million and I can appreciate the difficulty of trying to gauge how much money is in dormant accounts. It is right to focus on this issue because, over a period of years, the banking institutions have been using this as a capital base. I understand that, in anticipation of this legislation, those institutions have been instructed to try and establish the level of dormant accounts and to identify the next-of-kin if possible. I am aware of constituents who got letters from banks after many years. In one case, a person was told he had less than £1 in his account which had been dormant for some years. At least, it seems that some effort is being made to establish if there are next-of-kin to claim these dormant accounts.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill provides for the introduction of the relevant changes early in 2002 and that if the institutions have not established the identity of the bona fide next-of-kin, the State would claim the funds and disburse it appropriately. There may be various suggestions on how it should be disbursed and I have no doubt there are many meritorious projects. With appropriate rules and regulations and proper earmarking of the funds, I believe there can be a meaningful benefit to many communities and associations around the country. A very comprehensive White Paper on rural renewal was produced recently. Many rural communities have been very actively working to improve their situation and even to attract people into their areas. When the document was launched, the Taoiseach said he was very committed to this concept and that a rural proofing committee would be established. I am not sure if any meetings of that committee ever took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are concerned about decisions by the banking institutions, notably AIB in recent times, to close down many of their rural branches. For example, the rural community of Kilfinnan in west Limerick includes the headquarters of Ballyhoura Fáilte, a very successful Leader project. I have watched the area progress over a period of years. Much urban decay in that community has been replaced by modern buildings and a degree of commercial vitality has developed. Overnight, as part of their rationalisation programme and according to their own criteria which are not necessarily to do with losing money, the bank decided to close the local branch which had operated for the past 75 years. People were notified by letter that their accounts would be handled by the Kilmallock office of the bank. There was no consideration of other options, such as a reduction to three opening days per week, the establishment of a sub-office or some review per<Col N="794" /> iod. There was just a bald statement on the closure. People turned to their local public representatives to try to have something done about the matter. Deputations were formed and people were very emotional about the issue. Rural communities are striving to generate commercial activity and get people to live in the area. We try to make progress but suddenly a banking institution which makes billions of pounds makes a decision which rips the heart out of the local community and undoes much of the good people are trying to do.</P>
    <P>We may talk in this House about rural renewal. In the past we have talked about the importance of the local post office or the creamery and whether they have gone out of existence. There is now another deterrent to rural renewal, that is, when financial institutions decide to close a bank. The bank may say people are using the Internet or the telephone to do their banking but how many are using and have access to that type of facility? Are we saying somebody with a large sum of money must bring it by road to a neighbouring bank a few miles away? Are we contradicting what we are trying to do in stopping people keeping money in the biscuit tin or under the bed? People must now drive a few miles to a bank. Are we encouraging people to start hoarding again? </P>
    <P>I make these points in the context of this Dormant Accounts Bill because it relates, in particular, to the financial institutions. One rarely gets a chance to talk about a situation such as this in the House because one would be ruled out of order straight away. I have met people at a public meeting, and have seen 200 people galvanised into action. They say to a banking institution that even though people have left the bank in the past, they will guarantee further business if it decides to revoke its decision and stay in the area and that they will work extremely hard to advance the progress of the bank. However, I am afraid it all falls on deaf ears. If a decision is made at local level and is recommended to those at national level, will those who decided at local level go back to their superiors and say they made a mistake in the first place? </P>
    <P>Recently, banks have closed even in Dublin city &ndash; in the inner city areas. It is a phenomenon that is happening throughout the country and which will happen more often. It may not impact as much if there is another bank within a community but if a leading financial institution leaves a town, we are saying to potential industrialists and commercial businesses coming in that there is a lack of confidence in that community. That is the inherent danger of such a decision.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister cannot ask Mr. Buckley and the people in charge in AIB to look again at situations such as this because they look at things in a cold and clinical way. They look at demographic trends, whether industry is locating in the area and at the commercial vitality of the area. Yet a thriving community has had this facility <Col N="795" /> ripped from beneath it and a decision will be made at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>In the coming election, politicians like me will go to Kilfinnan as we have done many times in the past and we will be told by the local community how it feels about us as public representatives, yet the most crucial and pivotal decision will have been made by what they would consider a heartless financial institution. I am sure the people in AIB will retreat into their office &ndash; they will be faceless people to the local community. Politicians, however, will have to face these people.</P>
    <P>I have heard a great deal of rhetoric and noticed a great deal of lip service being paid to the idea of rural renewal and so on. It is all hollow rhetoric when decisions such as this are made. Many of our communities have been upgraded and improved because of community employment initiatives and FÁS schemes, yet suddenly the rug is pulled from under them. I make this point because the Kifinnan of today could be in the Minister's area tomorrow, or Deputy McGrath's area. Looking at the projections made by the Central Statistics of Office during the week, one will see the huge growth pattern projected for the Dublin area for the next 30 years, which is in sharp contrast to Deputy McGrath's area, the midlands. We try to encourage people to live in rural Ireland, yet we take the incentives away. I am saddened for local communities when I see these things happen.</P>
    <P>Most people make a decision to close a shop if it is not commercially viable. The banks do not make this decision because they are losing money. They are doing their projections for the next few years and are encouraging the closure of various offices so as to have a few banks dealing with finances in the future. I am pleased the Acting Chairman allowed me latitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their general welcome for the Bill. Some specific points were made by Deputies and I will endeavour to deal with them. Deputy Jim Mitchell said the dormancy period of 15 years, as defined in the Bill, is too long. This was arrived at in discussions with the banks. Given the large overhang of dormant accounts, we had to settle on a dormancy period that would be manageable for the banks. There is provision in the Bill to reduce the 15 year benchmark by way of ministerial regulation. When the backlog of dormant accounts has been reduced, I will consider whether to reduce the 15 year threshold but it would be premature at this stage when we are trying to get the scheme off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> Deputies will appreciate how big the workload will be when this is done for the first time. Next April the institutions will have to place advertisements in newspapers and they will be obliged to try to contact all the account holders concerned. That will take some time. The money will start to come in in 2003. Each year they will have to do a review but it will be a shortened review as they will have a database which will allow them to deal with one year. When that is up and running, I can consider reducing the dormancy period.</P>
    <P>Deputies must remember that to make this scheme effective, it is very important to get the financial institutions to administer it. If one looks at the whole scheme, one will see that I have transferred the responsibility of doing this to the financial institutions. If I was to say that there would be a very short dormancy period, the financial institutions would have to obey the law but they would say we would have to administer it ourselves. That would cause enormous difficulties. The financial institutions will administer the scheme and the moneys will be transferred to the NTMA and to this special fund. There are powers under the Act to appoint inspectors who will be allowed to visit the financial institution to see whether they are doing this work correctly. This is an enormous task and no one is under any illusions about it. It is very important that it is administered and worked effectively by the financial institutions with the powers of the inspectors to police it. When it is up and running, I am sure this matter can be revisited in the years to come. I pointed out that 15 years was the lowest period of dormancy of any of the countries at which we looked.</P>
    <P>For as long as I have been Minister for Finance, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and I have been conducting a correspondence course on this. Before I became Minister for Finance, I raised the issue of dormant accounts. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe had raised it previously as well. Luckily, before the Committee of Public Accounts reported, due to the efforts of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and my efforts in the Department &ndash; I inspired it to look at this matter &ndash; a great deal of work had been done in this area. My predecessor had looked at it as well and concluded that it was not worth doing anything. However, when the Committee of Public Accounts reported, much of this work had been done and, therefore, it was possible to bring forward this Bill within quite a short period. Even though over several years a great deal of work had been done &ndash; much of it in the last four years since I became Minister for Finance &ndash; issues came up which we had not envisaged. Bringing in a Dormant Accounts Bill might seem to be a very simple thing, but it has proven to be one of the most complex pieces of legislation ever brought before the House. There were legal issues which no one had thought of. When money is left in a bank account the banks have control of it. The issue of private property was also raised. It has been a enormous task. It is usually left to Final Stage to compli<Col N="797" /> ment officials, but I want to take this opportunity to compliment and thank the officials of my Department for the work that they have done on this Bill. The Bill has come on very quickly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell asked why prize bonds are not included in this Bill. These products are bought to be held for long periods, often until the holder dies. The capital of the prize bond fund is used to generate the prize fund. If a large part of that capital were removed it would greatly reduce the prize fund and undermine the viability of the whole scheme. Moreover, prize bond holders whose bonds were removed from draws would be rightly aggrieved. I made the decision to leave prize bonds out of the Bill for the present.</P>
    <P>The question of dormant insurance policies was raised and I have decided to put this into the Bill. Complex as trying to include dormant accounts in the Bill, dormant insurance policies proved to be a nightmare and it was decided to have two Bills. This is the Dormant Accounts Bill relating to financial institutions and it is hoped a Dormant Accounts Bill relating to insurance products will be published later in the year. It was too complex to facilitate in this Bill and I was anxious to have this functioning quickly. Had I waited until all issues about insurance policies were decided it would have taken a long time.</P>
    <P>The question of why account holders with less than 100 in their accounts will not be personally notified was asked. It was agreed that contacting all account holders would place a substantial additional administrative burden on the financial institutions on whom the bulk of the administration in this scheme is already falling. That is how the operational details of this Bill will be conducted. The scheme will be brought to the attention of the general public by annual advertisements in national newspapers and notices in each public branch of financial institutions. There is a section of this Bill which allows me to increase the sum from 100 and I will check, before Committee and Final Stages, that it will allow me, or future Ministers for Finance, to decrease that sum.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy McDowell welcomed the Bill and that he thought a period of 15 years to be about right. He asked how much is in the intestate estates account. I can tell him that there is a balance of about £2.7 million. Deputies Jim O'Keefe and McDowell also referred to the need for an advertising campaign to alert holders of dormant funds. The first advertisements will be published by the banks in April 2002, a full year before any of the funds will pass on to the NTMA. Deputy Timmins has once again raised the question of bank drafts. It was decided that the scheme would initially be confined to those products that could be readily brought within its ambit, that is, products similar to accounts in financial institutions. Other reasons for excluding bank drafts at this stage are difficulties in estimating the extent of dormant fund drafts and problems that would be encountered in attempting to trace holders of drafts. With no details of <Col N="798" /> addresses this would be a major problem. Section 9 of the Bill allows the scheme to be extended to other products by ministerial regulations. Further consideration may be given to bank drafts in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins raised the question of safekeeping that banks undertake on behalf of customers. This is something I have often wondered about myself. Like many other people I use the bank to keep documents such as life assurance policies. I have applied my mind as to how to go about tracing these people, maybe some of them did not want to be traced. It is interesting from an historical viewpoint but I do not have the answer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell and others asked what will be done with this money. I had considered how money from this fund will be distributed. The Public Accounts Committee recommended that it be used for good societal and community purposes. To get away from the problem of having the Government blamed of having a slush fund, it has been decided to establish a board of trustees. The board will distribute the money, subject to guidelines and without direction from the Government. This will get away from the problems of having Ministers accused of favouring pet projects, having the fund as part of general Estimates processes of Departments or having it as part of policy initiatives of Departments. I think this is the best approach. I thought that if this money, which belongs not to the State but to individuals, should be escheated to the State &ndash; subject to safeguards that people who look for it can be given it back &ndash; that the best approach was to give the power to distribute it to a disbursals board and not the Minister. I am not in a position to change the Bill at this stage. It was a decision I took and I think it is the safest one in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane raised the question of branch closures. I get a lot of representations from Deputies and Senators regarding such closures and the standard line is that I do not have any say in the matter.</P>

      <P>In page 6, lines 4 to 6, to delete &ldquo;or other interest groups affected by the decisions of HRI or who use the various facilities and services provided by HRI&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is necessitated by my deep attachment to a subsequent amendment. While this amendment simply deletes a certain reference in the section in question, it is motivated by the fact that I am proposing that there be punters representatives on the new board. There was a long discussion on this on Committee Stage. I am disappointed to note that the Minister does not have an amendment tabled for Report Stage that reflects what I proposed on Committee Stage. Has the Minister had any second thoughts in the meantime? He argued on Committee Stage that it would be difficult to find suitable representatives of punters to be members of the board because there was a diversity of interests involved and a rather dispersed group of people, to which I replied that he did not seem to have any difficulty envisaging finding representatives of punters to go on the forum he proposes to set up. I suggested that if he could find suitable representatives to go on the forum, equally he could find suitable representatives to be on the board. The proposal he made to have representatives on the forum is an admission that the basic amendment on which this is based, which I put forward, is <Col N="800" /> feasible and I can see no reason he should not proceed to do this. The Minister knows perfectly well that a person who is a member of the board of the Horseracing Authority, the body which it is proposed to terminate and replace by the HRI, represents punters. She has carried out that job for some time. I am not in a position to judge what kind of a hearing that person has had, but that experience should indicate that it would be appropriate to continue with that, which is what I propose in seeking to expand the board to make that kind of representation possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister also told us on Committee Stage that he wants to provide this forum because there are a number of other interests in the sector that he would like to see consulted. For that reason, he felt it would be appropriate and that it could include representatives of racegoers organisations, of jockeys and, if my memory serves me correctly, he even though of representatives of people who work in the stables and so on. I perfectly understand that proposal. If the Minister is going to proceed with that proposal, then these people should also be represented on it.</P>
    <P>I seriously want to make the point that it is not enough to pay lip service to the idea that the most important people in this business are the punters. Without them, there would be no business. Without the people who go to the race tracks, who watch races on television, who go to the bookies' offices, who organise race nights to support their political parties or charitable causes or any of the many other reasons people organise race nights, there would not be an industry. People organise race nights because they like racing and because, as the Minister knows well, they think it is a good way to get a crowd in to support a political party, a charitable cause or a community organisation. Those people like racing. They like to see horses racing. They like to have a bet and they are interested in racing.</P>
    <P>If those people were not there, there would be no point in having the HRI, racecourses or doing all the things the HRI will set out to do. It is a case of &ldquo;if you ain't got customers, then you ain't got a business&rdquo;. We need those people because they are the foundation and the <i>sine qua non</i> of the business. If we did not have those people, there would be no point in breeding good race horses or training them. There would be no point in building racecourses or in having senior stewards, clerk stewards and all the rest of them. There would be no point in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development spending time worrying about it or colloguing with the Minister for Finance to sort it out. Without these people, there would be no business.</P>
    <P>It seems that to have a board to run the affairs of the business in the way the Minister proposes here without those people having a say is pure nonsense. Why does the Minister not realise that? There may be people in the business who feel there are aspects of it that are mysterious, arcane or hidden from the public gaze. There are not. There are no mysteries in this business. There is <Col N="801" /> a good deal of competition in it and a good deal of information people in the business like to keep from others in the business for commercial reasons, but there are no arcane mysteries about it. There is no special reason some people in the business are represented there and others are not, although maybe I am wrong, maybe there are. Perhaps it is because people who concentrate on a certain type of activity, who are a smaller group than the total group of the punters, have a particular interest. If I wanted to be pejorative about it, which I do not, I would describe it as a vested interest. It is what is called a vested interest in common parlance. They have a particular interest in the business. They will legitimately try to promote that interest and will argue probably rightly that in promoting that interest they are also promoting the general interests of the business. That is all very fine as far as it goes, but it does not go the whole length.</P>
    <P>There is one group of people who have the basic interest that is needed in this business. They are prepared to spend their money at evening meetings on a Saturday or on a Sunday, at festivals, at race meetings, patronising racecourses, going to the tote, going to the bookies' shops, or even, God forbid, there are people who are prepared to pay per view to watch it on television. All those people are there and they do that because they enjoy it. If they did not do that, there would be no point in any of this because there would be no business. It is the punters who generate demand for all the things that the people who will now be represented on this board actually do.</P>
    <P>I do not know how one would describe this Government. It increasingly seems to be fractionated. I think most of its members would think they are democratic. If the Minister has them, which I am sure he has, I ask him to unleash his democratic instincts and accept the legitimacy and the fundamental nature of the interests of punters in the business. It is not a major step. It will not do any violence to the Bill, to the board, to the interests which it is proposed to represent on the board or to the future of the business; quite the contrary. If the Minister, when talking to the organisations to which he will talk in order to set up this forum, asks them to agree a proposal so that two representatives of theirs can be appointed to be members of this board, he will have done a good day's work and we will have a board of which it can truly be said represents all aspects of this business.</P>
    <P>The Minister is smiling benignly at me as he usually does. It is his way out of most difficult situations and I have seen him do it time after time. He smiles benignly and everyone thinks this is gentleman Joe and that he is a very nice man, but they forget to notice he is not doing any of the things they want him to do. I ask him if there anything inaccurate or untrue in what I have said. Does he believe I am wrong in saying that without punters we would have no business? Does he believe I am wrong in saying that it is punters <Col N="802" /> who provide the impetus for everything this board will do? Without punters there would be no future for this business. If the Minister tells me I am wrong in any of my assertions, I will happily withdraw the amendment. However, if he cannot tell me I am wrong, the only sensible thing he can do is accept this amendment and the later one that gives rise to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage when I pointed out that the genesis of the Minister's problem is the October declaration in 2000. The Minister's dilemma is interesting and demonstrates the difficulty of deciding matters outside the House which might impinge or have an impact on his ability to be flexible in the House afterwards, especially in relation to a reasonable amendment such as that put forward by Deputy Dukes. This amendment is fundamental to the subsequent amendments; all those amendments could have been grouped together. I do not know why we cannot conduct our business that way. Deputy Dukes could have discussed his later amendment which also covers the subject of my amendment.</P>
      <P>It is a truism that people who attend race courses, either for greyhound or horse racing, are the lifeblood of the industry. They are of paramount importance to its survival and growth. There is something peculiar about their exclusion from the body that will run the industry. People pay significant amounts of money to enter race courses. There would be no need for bookmakers and racing could not survive if the punters withdrew <i>en masse.</i> One cannot make a case against Deputy Dukes's assertions about their vital importance.</P>
      <P>One could look at another example of consultative forums. The Minister's great predecessor, Éamon de Valera, who probably initially drew the Minister to Fianna Fáil, regularly talked about draining the Shannon. He had many successors in that regard but I never fell for it; I hope I have a pearl of wisdom in my head.</P>

      <P>Exactly, especially last January 12 months. They set up a consultative forum on the Shannon. It was the greatest waste of time. It was a talk shop where nothing happened; it was useless. If it had been effective, the problems which arose last January 12 months would have been dealt with. However, it had no power. It could talk all day and night and invite representatives of the ESB and Bord na Móna to talk to it but it could make no decisions. That is the reason punters feel they are excluded.</P>

No matter what comes forward from consultations with the punters, it will mean nothing because the real power broking takes place at board level. Only the board has the right to information and the <Col N="803" /> right to make important and strong decisions. That is the reason there is a sub-group of the transport committee considering putting together something that will have teeth and statutory authority with regard to the Shannon.</P>
    <P>There have been various discussions about a Shannon authority. Would it not be extremely foolish to establish a Shannon authority which did not have the input of fishermen, farmers or landowners along the Shannon who would be affected by the authority? It would be foolish to exclude the people who are actually involved. It would be equally foolish to exclude Westmeath County Council or Roscommon County Council. Exclusion of the punter from this board has the same effect as engaging in the harebrained idea of establishing a Shannon authority and not having the local authority representatives on board.</P>
    <P>This is the only mistake the Minister made in the Bill. The rest of it is good and every change the Minister made has simply refined and improved it. However, this is an area where the Minister got hooked on the petard of conciliation outside this forum. The Minister gave a commitment and I understand what is involved in doing that. I must tell Deputy Sheehan that the Minister is strong when it comes to commitments, although he maintains the Minister did not fulfil the one about the abattoir. In this regard the Minister gave a commitment which has us arguing for something which the punters, the vast bulk of the people who participate in the industry, want but which means he is unable to concede to a reasonable request from myself and Deputy Dukes in our amendments.</P>

      <P>I support the comments of my colleagues. Unfortunately, I could not attend the debate on Committee Stage of the Bill but I trust these points were made to the Minister. They were certainly made on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a major step forward for the horse racing industry and it has been welcomed by all Members of the House. However, this aspect must be addressed. The Minister gave his reasons for not wishing to proceed in this fashion but I appeal to him to look again at the necessity &ndash; it is not simply a desire &ndash; to have representation at board level for the people who keep the industry ticking over all year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horse racing industry is strong but we must be concerned about the growth level in attendances. Many of the problems which keep people away from racing, such as poor facilities, can best be addressed by the punters who attend race meetings. They have the strongest voice to address the problems that remain in the industry and to help the industry grow more significantly and attract people back to racing, particularly young people. In recent years the age profile of attendances at race meetings has not been particularly young. To attract people back to racing and involve them even at spectator level, it is <Col N="804" /> important that their advice is heard at board level.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Dukes provides the missing link. This industry is growing, but to thrive more fully, to expand and to secure its future into the coming decades it needs a strong voice at board level from those who are willing to turn up in numbers and spend money at race meetings.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The latest results from the quarterly national household survey showed that there were 65,600 persons unemployed in the first quarter of 2001, an annual decrease of almost 16,000.</P>
      <P>The number of persons long-term unemployed fell by 8,200 to 21,500. There were 43,500 persons unemployed for less than a year, which is also a fall of 8,200 on the 2000 figure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it into perspective, a Cheann Comhairle, because the figures do not tell the full story. Does the Minister of State factor into his figures that, according to the INOU, there are 144,000 people out there who want work but who cannot take up work for all sorts of reasons such as the cost of accommodation, the risk of losing benefits like rent support, child care costs or, that they must care for sick or elderly relations? Are these people factored into his unemployment figures? Would he agree that the figures need to be taken together with reports of high pockets of unemployment, considering that unemployment rates <Col N="805" /> are higher in particular areas, both urban and rural, where people feel that the Celtic tiger is nothing more than a cartoon figure at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I gave the House are those from the Central Statistics Office. The figure for unemployed persons is 65,600, that is, an unemployment rate of 3.7% compared to an EU average of 8%.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point. There are pockets where the unemployment rate is considerably higher. Obviously the 3.7% rate is an average rate and we all know of pockets in constituencies around the country where the figures would be significantly higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, given that recently the live register stood at 141,600, would the Minister agree that there is a significant number of categories of people, particularly many tens of thousands of people with disabilities, who are still unemployed and who face a fairly limited future because they cannot access job opportunities? There are other groups, including people recovering from addiction, ex-offenders and members of the Traveller community, in particular. This morning we had a discussion about another group, people who recently entered the country. Would he agree, therefore, that the quarterly national household survey figures he gave grossly under estimate the true level of unemployment and that it is an area of grave concern?</P>
      <P>Most Deputies, courtesy of the Internet, have received a copy of the famous letter which his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, sent to FÁS. Will the Minister of State comment on that letter, which outlines a new mission statement for that organisation but does not, as far as I can see, take into account any of the factors raised by me or Deputy Sargent, particularly regarding issues like immigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question about the number on the live register compared to the number in the quarterly national household survey. Perhaps we might deal with that in more detail when we come to that question because we should not confuse the two groups. Quite a number of those on the live register do not describe themselves as unemployed. They are available for benefits and collect benefits of different sorts, whereas the quarterly national household survey involves the persons describing themselves as unemployed.</P>
      <P>I could not accept that the figures are grossly under estimated. The 65,600 figure is the one reported in the quarterly national household survey, which gives a national rate of 3.7%. The long-term unemployed rate is now 1.2%, but I have already acknowledged that there are pockets all over the country where there are significantly higher figures than these, including in the categories mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>To return to the calculation of the figures the Minister of State quoted, I note there is a dispute about the discrepancy between the live register and the quarterly national household survey. Focusing on the quarterly national household survey, I presume those figures include people who would not necessarily claim unemployment benefits such as lone parent's benefit. Would the Minister of State agree that many of the people in the particular sub-set to which I refer are actually debarred from working in that they would be worse off financially if they were to take up work or if they were to go into education? Does he agree that a lone parent who left school at 16&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Department or the CSO propose &ndash; I am staying within the confines of Standing Orders for statistical matters rather than policy matters &ndash; to measure qualitative reasons as to why, at a time of relatively full unemployment, 21,000 people are categorised long-term unemployed? We could, for example, measure their literacy, educational and personal domestic circumstances. They may, in effect, be carers who do not qualify for the carer's allowance. Are there proposals to get behind the nature of these figures so that policy can be better informed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn that we need to ask questions of the 21,000 long-<Col N="807" /> term unemployed people. I understand such a task is envisaged. We are trying to settle down the quarterly national household survey which is only a couple of years old. There has been a dramatic shift in figures. We intend to move on and as the numbers come into focus we will try to find out, from the persons describing themselves as such, why these people are unavailable for work. That is not done on any major scale at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience in the current by-election campaign in Tipperary South &ndash; this is true of the entire country &ndash; there are certain housing estates where the local authority would, in the main, be the landlord and the official data regarding rents and so on indicates concentrations of very high levels of unemployment. The figure is 40% or even 50% in some small estates. Is there a proposal, in the plans referred to by the Minister of State, for the CSO to liaise with the health boards, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or local authorities, in their housing authority capacity, to focus the spotlight on pockets of unemployment? The culture of employment in some households may well have disappeared for two or three generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a sample of 39,000 persons on a quarterly rolling basis. As such, the CSO would not have statistics for particular estates. That would have to be done in another way. I will discuss the matter with the CSO. A number of Government programmes are available for areas of high unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State consider that the quarterly national household survey is a crude measure of what is essentially a complex issue for many people qualified by all sorts of factors which do not come into play when one is simply dealing with bare statistics? There is a huge contrast between the labour force statistics regarding those in and out of work. The information I have for May 2001 indicates a growth of 43,400 between the first quarter of 2000 and the <Col N="808" /> first quarter of 2001 and this was attributed to greater numbers of people of working age rather than to a higher rate of participation. Is there a need to be clear and careful regarding how figures are published without any meaningful qualification? </P>
      <P>When I raised a question regarding the latest figures for the long-term unemployed, the Minister of State gave me previous figures to show a trend. Is he now able to indicate a trend from here on out in terms of what the CSO is predicting? If it can predict what happened looking at past figures, is it able to say where we are going? Are we bottoming out? Are long-term unemployed people to be left in that position? Will FÁS policy to do away with community employment schemes not exacerbate the participative nature&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="809" /> Are there proposals to examine the sub-sets within the categories of those termed unemployed and long-term unemployed? Using the example of one of those categories, lone parents, some of these sub-sets have a higher level of unemployment than other sections of the population in general. Will the CSO examine the specific causes in each of those categories? Does the Minister of State agree that in some cases there can be barriers to allowing such people back into the workforce? That information, if compiled, could be extremely useful in developing policy in this area.</P>

I take the point that one could look within them. I will discuss the issue with the CSO. People are asked if they are available for work. Obviously, people on particular allowances would not be available for work. We must take that information into account.</P>

      <P>Are there any plans to undertake a more detailed examination of these figures to ascertain why there has been such a dramatic shift in relation to some counties? For example, County Leitrim was traditionally the poorest county in Ireland. Now, counties in the midlands are the poorest. Does the Minister of State agree <Col N="810" /> that a more detailed survey would be of benefit in helping to ensure the resources are targeted into those areas of the country which appear to be losing out as the economy expands?</P>

      <P>The CSO only decided to take this new initiative last year. It commenced work by looking at the period 1991-97. The figures I have given relate to 1997 and 1998, which is five years ago. Given other indicators, I assume they have substantially improved.</P>
      <P>The data are compiled at regional and county level but the CSO strongly stresses that the information I have provided to the House can only be indicative because for a number of reasons it is not possible to provide neat figures for counties. It is important, therefore, that the House understand this and that the figures are five years old.</P>

      <P>The CSO only decided on this new initiative in 2000. It was decided to take the period 1991-97 and I presume it will be able to get more up to date figures as the project proceeds. A notable feature of the figures was the 6% increase in disposable income <i>per capita </i>in County Kildare during that period, from 94% to 100.6% of the State average, due mainly to the expansion of the Dublin metropolitan region. By contrast, the disposable income of the south-east region has declined from 92% of the State average in 1991 to 88% in 1998, with all counties in the area showing a decline.</P>

      <P>The plans for information technology in the CSO are based on its IT and data management strategies, published in April and May 1999. These strategies were fully discussed with the centre for management and organisation development of the Department of Finance. They were also discussed with staff interests in two phases and finally agreed in September 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase 1 of the IT strategy, which has been completed, concentrated on the establishment of a client-server architecture. This included the roll-out of groupware, Lotus Notes, throughout the organisation which has now facilitated document management and considerably improved internal communications. The CSO is currently upgrading the capacity and security of its network. Preparations are also under way to have this architec<Col N="813" /> ture ready for Internet dissemination by summer of this year.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 of the IT strategy has as its main goal the implementation of the data management strategy. The key objective of this is the migration of data from the mainframe to the new client-server environment. The strategy also includes the establishment of corporate data bases and a web-linked dissemination database. The CSO has also implemented a central business register and a classification server.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that something is happening in relation to the CSO. Regarding the completion of the plan, will the website be radically overhauled to make it user friendly? Following the overhaul, will the people, particularly from the business community, who feed statistics into the CSO have a system available to them that is similar to the one used by the Revenue Commissioners? This would ensure the large number of man hours currently taken up compiling figures for submission to the CSO is dramatically reduced. Is work being done on developing software for small businesses in particular so that this data can be compiled easily on an ongoing basis and frequently submitted to the CSO? Does the Minister of State agree such a mechanism would ensure a more accurate collation of the figures required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the chief executive officer has made great strides recently in the IT area. Much effort has been put into that work and additional funding was provided for it recently. I understand the CSO is revamping its website and it will be available by the end of June. This will allow users to download data for further analysis. All CSO releases are placed on the website. The office plans to develop its website and place updated information on it.</P>
      <P>While we are all critical of it from time to time, the CSO recently won a five star rating in the state of the net report. The company involved gives awards to websites and it pointed out that the CSO's website was simple but attractively laid out. The CSO has made great strides and it is starting to put resources into that area. I agree that statistics should be available at the click of a mouse button from the CSO directly. A major objective of the office is to ensure that, once it is ready, all the information it has is placed on the website so that people can access it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute that the website is well laid out and I agree that the five star rating is a good assessment from that point of view. However, I am critical of the ability to access and download information. Will the new website ensure that aspect is improved? Are users of the website participating in its overhaul? It is important that users have an input into that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> Are there plans to develop software and to put systems in place to ensure information can be easily compiled by small businesses? This would enable the information to be submitted easily to the CSO without taking up a large amount of time, as is the case at present. The compilation of this information creates enormous costs for small businesses because of the detail required and the demands placed on them. Does the Minister of State agree the use of information technology would dramatically reduce those difficulties? What action is being taken to implement such changes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>While decentralisation has many merits, does the Minister of State agree the move to Cork resulted in a massive changeover of staff in the CSO? The level now being reached in relation to statistics might have been reached a few years ago if the original office had remained in place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments because, in common with other Deputies, I use the CSO website. However, the equivalent British site, the US site, Economica, and various other sites give a more in-depth analysis of statistics, for example, in relation to unemployment levels and district electoral divisions. It should be possible to pinpoint unemployment blackspots and the different characteristics of localities. The Dublin Development Board recently produced a detailed statistical report on the four Dublin counties. It is interesting that the statistics were complied by an outside consultant and were not based primarily on national figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The website should be fully interactive and small businesses should be able to submit their information. The system should be similar to on-line banking where one can access one's account, send in information and so on. The Revenue Commissioners also have a system where one can submit information provided one has a security code and the information is encrypted. If the CSO had such a system, people could communicate with the CSO through the website and submit information. I assume this is the direction in which the office is headed with respect to its revamped website and I will encourage it to take that route.</P>
      <P>A website that is not interactive in that sense is only half a website. One can communicate with an office only via e-mail and that is probably not satisfactory in this area. A more structured interactive website that accepts information with secure codes would mean that people would not have to fill in many forms. I intend to press the CSO to take that direction, but I would be surprised if it was not intending to take that route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The move to Cork did not have a major bearing on the CSO's policies and plans. It was not a factor. I have not visited the office in Cork, but I visited the office in Rathmines recently. I was greatly impressed by the staff's enthusiasm and determination to continue to modernise the <Col N="815" /> organisation. The workforce there is remarkably young and the staff are all extremely enthusiastic, bright and intelligent. We are fortunate to have them.</P>

      <P>The information and communications technology sector &ndash; ICT &ndash; is defined by the OECD and EUROSTAT as covering eight sectors in the manufacturing industry and a further 11 sectors in the service industry.</P>
      <P>These ICT sectors are already covered as part of existing CSO inquiries. The ICT manufacturing industry sectors are covered by the annual census of industrial production.

      <P>I hesitate to quarrel with the Minister of State but the information given to me is that there is not a set of questions designed to give a detailed profile of the information technology industry, including the precise number of companies, the type of company, the number of employees and whether the ownership is national or non-national. I may have misunderstood the Minister of State's reply and I appreciate he is not directly responsible for its formulation. However, given the shake out in the IT sector internationally and nationally, it has been formally communicated to me that it is difficult to formulate policy because of the imprecise nature of the statistical information available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the briefing information available to the Minister of State can elaborate on his formal reply. I am informed that notwithstanding the fact that we have invested a lot of time, energy and political commitment we simply do not have the information that is requested in my former question.

      <P>Before I received and studied the file I had the same impression as Deputy Quinn, that we did not know the number of firms in software and so on that were involved in development. I have given the House the information I have been sent over so far but I will go back and check on it again. I have a supplementary note which states that among the information being collected by the CSO inquiry is the number of firms, the type of firms, whether an enterprise or one of a number of local units into which the enterprise is split, the number of employees, and the nationality of the ownership. Other information collected includes labour costs, turnover, purchase of stocks and so on. It goes on to say that software consultancy and supply are included in the ICT sector but that the software manufacturing industry is not part of it as internationally defined. It seems to indicate that that information is there and a table I have in my possession states the number of enterprises, turnover, gross value added, wages and salaries and persons employed on the manufacturing side &ndash; it seems to deal more with the manufacturing side. I will take the Deputy's invitation to revisit it if I may.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The monthly live register figures show how many people are claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or signing for social welfare credits. At the end of May 2001, there were 133,691 persons on the live register.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office's live register releases contain a detailed breakdown at local level, including figures on the number of claimants by sex, age group and type of claim. As the results are normally published within a week, the live register is widely used as a short-term indicator of recent trends.</P>
      <P>The live register does not measure unemployment on a basis that is comparable over time or between countries. It is an administrative figure which reflects people's benefit status as distinct from their labour force status. The live register includes many people who are not unemployed &ndash; for example, part-time workers who are entitled under the social welfare rules to sign on in respect of days when they do not have work.</P>
      <P>The primary source of comparable statistics on unemployment is the quarterly national household survey. This survey, which began in 1997, provides detailed quarterly figures on employment and unemployment. It is carried out under EU Council Regulation 577/98 and meets the ILO guidelines for internationally comparable labour force statistics.</P>
      <P>The CSO's labour market statistics liaison group, which has met on two occasions, has discussed the use and presentation of live register and quarterly national household survey statistics. The group will continue to advise the CSO on these matters and, in this regard, there are no plans to discontinue publication of the monthly live register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State not agree that the two sets of figures can lead to confusion as to who exactly is unemployed? The quarterly household survey gives a figure for those who are unable to get work, not even one day a week part-time, and the live register figures cover those people as well. For example, if someone works one day a fortnight they are not considered unemployed under the household survey but they are considered unemployed under the live register. We need to look at both sets of figures and try to resolve the differences there if we are to get an accurate level of unemployment and those who are available for full-time work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow the constructive supplementary questions put by Deputy Naughten, is it not time to change the terminology &ldquo;the live register&rdquo; and describe it as it is, which is the num<Col N="818" /> ber of people administratively claiming and receiving benefit? What we really need to measure is the number of people who are not working and would like to work, those who are seeking work as distinct from categories of people who are part-time workers. The Minister of State will be aware that there are approximately 187,000 part-time workers, some of whom would be included in these figures. The live register is a misleading figure in the sense that the word &ldquo;live&rdquo; conveys the impression that these are people actively seeking employment and who are currently unemployed when in fact that is not the case. I do not know if this matter has been discussed with the CSO and the relevant Government Department, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, but I think it is time, given the statistical remit, for a qualitative change.</P>
      <P>Are there any moves to change the quarterly household survey with its database of some 39,000 &ndash; I think that is the figure given &ndash; into a monthly survey with a smaller base? Opinion polls have a sampling base of 1,000 to 1,500, and a monthly figure would give us a more accurate and a more frequent measure of unemployment in the real sense on a much smaller base for the same cost. Would the Minister of State not agree that a sampling based on 20,000 or 25,000 might give us a much more accurate figure and a locational figure of people looking for employment? Let the live register revert to what it is, simply an administrative description of those receiving benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point, I can certainly raise it with the CSO but it has only started doing them quarterly in the past number of years. Whether they are geared to move to a monthly one I would not know but I will check it for the Deputy. I think the international trend is quarterly because it works the bumps out of it.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;live register&rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer nowadays and we certainly should look at it. Perhaps it is something we should raise with the social partners in case there is some attachment to it. I have no difficulty in changing that title but there is more than my view to be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a recent newspaper report which states that BNFL has prepared a corporate plan that has been submitted to the UK Government. The same newspaper report, however, states that the UK Department of Trade and Industry is not aware of any plans for new nuclear power stations. I have asked the UK Department of Trade and Industry for information on this matter and have received the following statement:</P>
      <P>Both BNFL and British Energy have said clearly that they have no plans to build new nuclear power stations, reflecting their view that at present there is no economic case for investment in new stations. It follows that the UK Government has not received any plan from BNFL proposing new nuclear power stations.</P>
      <P>The content of this newspaper report was also raised by my Department at a meeting recently of the UK-Ireland contact group on radioactivity matters. This group which comprises representatives of my Department, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and their UK counterparts meets twice yearly to discuss matters relating to Sellafield and radioactivity matters generally.</P>
      <P>The UK Government is under no illusion as to the Irish Government's concerns about and opposition to the nuclear energy facilities in the UK, in particular the Sellafield operations, and to any expansion of such facilities. The House will be aware of the Irish Government's decision last week to take action against the UK Government under the OSPAR Convention relating to the proposed mixed oxide fuel fabrication plant at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I will be maintaining a close watch on any developments relating to any proposed expansion of nuclear energy facilities in the UK.

We must do our utmost to ensure that these plants are not replaced with new nuclear generators but by some other alternative source of energy.</P>

They make that argument very forcibly in terms of the economics of it and in terms of the environment. We have all seen the tragedy of Windscale and Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to contact his opposite number in Britain and find out what kind of programme is being put in place for the replacement of the existing 30 worn-out existing nuclear plants. I ask him to do everything possible to persuade them not to replace these plants with modern state-of-the-art nuclear plants but rather some other alternative such as gas, oil or other alternative energy, of which they have adequate resources.</P>

He is correct when he voices his concern and it reflects my own and the Government's concern about the current trend, particularly by the main nuclear producing countries, of endeavouring to categorise nuclear production as sustainable particularly in the context of global warming and the commitments made by countries to the Kyoto Treaty. I raised this issue very vigorously at international fora in New York and in Paris &ndash; under the CSD, the Commission for Sustainable Development, under the auspices of the United Nations in New York, and under the International Energy Agency in Paris. Ireland will not accept that nuclear production is a sustainable production and it cannot be and must not be linked to sustainable energy.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Irish Government has decided to proceed with an action against the UK Government in relation to the proposed MOX plant at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to settle, by way of an arbitration tribunal under the OSPAR Convention, a dispute between Ireland and the UK. The dispute relates to the withholding by the UK, on grounds <Col N="821" /> of commercial confidentiality, of information essential to assessing the justification of the full commissioning of the proposed MOX plant.</P>
    <P>I have consistently opposed the commissioning of this plant and have expressed the Irish Government's total opposition to the plant in detailed submissions made to the UK authorities &ndash; in response to each of the four rounds of public consultation held by the UK authorities &ndash; the most recent of which commenced in March and closed in May 2001. I have repeatedly demanded the full release of information supporting the economic justification of the plant. My demands were refused on the grounds that full release of information would prejudice BNFL's commercial interests. The matter was also raised by Ireland at last year's OSPAR Commission meeting.</P>
    <P>The UK Ministers for the Environment and Health have yet to decide on whether to give the go-ahead to the plant but there is a risk that they will do so when they have examined the outcome of the most recent round of public consultation. I am concerned that a decision to proceed with the plant may be imminent. I consider it essential, therefore, that Ireland, having exhausted all other avenues, should now proceed with the action under the OSPAR Commission. The official submission in this regard has been made to the commission and the UK authorities have also been notified. In this context I have also asked the UK not to take any steps which might affect Ireland's rights in this matter, including the authorisation of the proposed MOX plant, pending the conclusion of this arbitration procedure. I should mention also that Ireland is preparing a case for legal action against the UK Government under EU law in the event of the MOX plant going ahead.</P>
    <P>The production of MOX fuel is essentially a part of the spent fuel reprocessing activities at Sellafield. I have written to each of the OSPAR contracting parties informing them of the Irish Government's concerns about the resumption of shipments of spent fuel to Sellafield from Germany and the Netherlands and pointing out that such shipments are not in keeping with the spirit of the decision adopted at last year's meeting of the OSPAR Commission. I also informed them that Ireland has tabled a draft decision for consideration and adoption at the next OSPAR Commission meeting in Valencia next week. Ireland's draft decision calls, <i>inter alia</i>, for the urgent completion of the current review of discharge authorisations limits and, until such time as the review is completed, a moratorium on activities which encourage and promote the spent fuel nuclear reprocessing option.</P>

I strongly welcome the proposed action by the Minister. In support of his action I ask if he would agree that it is entirely unacceptable to Ireland that this new MOX plant which gives a lifeline to the Sellafield complex would go ahead. I ask him to assure the House that he will take whatever action he can to prevent that. Does the Minister agree that the storage of high level liquid waste at Sellafield poses a very real danger to Ireland because of the volatility of this level waste in huge quantities? Will the Minister say if there is any progress by the British authorities on the vitrification of this waste so that it can then be more safely stored, despite the repeated assurances that this would be speeded up? Will the Minister's proposed action include action against the new discharges of technetium 99 into the Irish Sea, despite the treaty obligations of the British authorities in this matter and their assurances to the Irish Government? </P>

      <Quest>if she is satisfied that the answer to parliamentary Question No. 43 of 13 February 2001 was accurate in relation to the role of the Irish Aviation Authority and red zones at airports; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The response to the Dáil Question on 13 February had two basic objectives. First, it conveyed the information received from Aer Rianta in response to the question itself, that is, Aer Rianta does not have car parks located in the red zones at Dublin airport. Secondly, it was to convey the distinction between aviation safety <i>per se </i>and the concept of public safety in the vicinity of airports and to inform the House of the work in hands between this Department and other agencies to develop public safety zones around our airports.</P>
      <P>The red zones at the airports were developed in the 1960s to indicate to the local authorities the areas in which development should be restricted in the interests of aviation safety specifically and public safety generally. The red zones have traditionally had two basic functions, namely, the aviation safety function of avoiding developments which because of their height may interfere with the safe take-off and landing of aircraft, but also avoiding developments which because of their location would add to public safety risks, the risk to people on the ground.</P>
      <P>On the establishment of the Irish Aviation Authority in 1994, responsibility for the implementation of aviation safety standards was transferred to that authority. When consulted about proposed developments in the red zones, the IAA advises the planning authorities of any conflict with international aviation safety requirements and draws its attention to the increased public safety risks in those areas.</P>
      <P>The work in hand to develop public safety zones around our airports, when completed, will clarify that the primary agency in relation to aviation safety assessments will continue to be the Irish Aviation Authority whereas the primary agency in assessing public safety risks will thereafter be the relevant planning authority. In any event, the planning authorities in accordance with their own statutory obligations and ultimately An Bord Pleanála will continue to decide whether specific development proposals in the vicinity of airports receive planning permission.</P>

      <P>If we are talking about 1960, the Irish Aviation Authority was not in existence. It was established in 1994. I am not surprised at the confusion voiced by the Deputy because there has been increasing confusion and concern about the role of the red zones. To endeavour to deal with that concern and confusion, this Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has commissioned ERM consultants to make recommendations for public safety zones in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. The recommendations of the consultants will specifically deal with the risk to people on the ground. When this work is completed the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will issue planning guidelines for the local authorities who will then be responsible for considering the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports. I understand that ERM will shortly begin seeking public comments on its conclusions in draft form.</P>

        <b>: </b>Will the Minister acknowledge that a mini-CTC contract which was supposed to cost £15 million and will now cost £50 million, and for which the clock is still ticking, will be investigated by a sub-committee at her behest? She asked the joint committee to carry out the investigation and it was recommended in the House. That sub-committee is operational and has brought in advisers as well as very senior legal advice. For the board of CIE to deliberately decide to cancel the contract was almost a deliberate attempt to cut across the work of a sub-committee established to investigate this at the Minister's request. By cancelling the contract one is almost immediately inviting a legal challenge. On that basis, the work of the committee, which the Minister requested to undertake this very important work, could be terminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that may be the interpretation of many members of the committee. I was at a meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers on the day the board took that decision. When it was taken, the chairman of CIE telephoned the office of Deputy Doherty, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, for an appointment. They met in <Col N="826" /> the morning and later that day the chairman told the Department. On the following morning, Thursday morning, Deputy Doherty asked me to meet him, which I did. I think he reported back to the committee saying I would contact him after the weekend. That was a bank holiday weekend and I contacted him on the Tuesday. In the interim, I had spoken to the chairman of CIE and told him the feelings of the chair, which, I am sure, were representative of the committee and he reiterated to me that the decision had been taken by the board.</P>

        <b>: </b>In her capacity of custodian of most of the shares in CIE, and with a certain number of nominees on the board, would the Minister not agree that there was little logic in the decision to terminate the contract by virtue of the fact that the work has already been suspended? The work is not ongoing. The work on the 28 stations that were to be connected under the mini-CTC probably represents the most costly overrun in the history of the State. There was nothing to be gained by terminating the contract because the work is now at a standstill and cannot proceed until the sub-committee has completed its work and the Minister gives formal approval for it to proceed again. There was nothing to be gained and everything to be lost by the board taking a unilateral decision particularly given that the Minister has nominees on the board.</P>

    <P>In summary, the table indicates that under reasonable assumptions the contribution of renewable energy to total primary energy requirement &ndash; TPER &ndash; should rise from 1.89% in 1999 to 2.16% by 2002. When provision is made for the additional 500 MW target, which I announced in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, the contribution by all renewables should rise towards 12% of total electricity output by 2005, which equates to about 5% of TPER.</P>
    <P>Advice to private individuals and companies is provided by the Renewable Energy Information Office &ndash; REIO &ndash; whose mandate is to promote the use of renewable energy resources and provide independent advice to all sectors on financial, environmental and technical issues relating to the further development of renewable energy technologies. The REIO staff includes a number of technical and marketing experts and its services are provided at no charge to its customers.</P>
    <P>In addition, the national development plan for energy related expenditure includes up to £43 million to support renewable energy technologies generally. A programme to distribute this funding will be settled and published after certain cost studies on recommendations of the renewable energy strategy group have concluded.</P>
    <P>As regards energy conservation, the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, which I published in September 1999, outlined a framework for energy policy in Ireland and identified energy conservation initiatives as having a key role. In this regard, the national development plan has allocated a figure of £103 million primarily for the promotion of energy conservation through information and education programmes.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am currently guiding legislation through the Oireachtas, which will establish the Irish Energy Centre as a statutory body. When enacted, the IEC will be renamed the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and a large element of the NDP funding, £33.6 million, will be spent on strengthening activities of the new enlarged authority. This will allow the authority the flexibility to deliver on its mandate under the NDP and the Green Paper, as well as the national climate change strategy.</P>
    <P>The new body will oversee targeted programmes to improve lifestyle approaches to energy consumption, retrofit projects to enhance the efficiencies of existing building stock and improved investment in energy efficiency in new <Col N="828" /> buildings in order to stem the growth of energy consumption in Ireland.</P>

      <P>If I have my way, the legislation will be completed this term. We have taken it through the Seanad and are endeavouring to get it into this House. I would dearly like to have it processed this term. We have a strong and growing economy <i>Deo gratias</i>. However, that is presenting us with some problems and we have gone well ahead of what we signed up for at Kyoto in terms of noxious emissions into the atmosphere. That is being addressed, primarily by the Minister of the Environment and Local Government and my Department has its part to play by way of energy conservation and focusing on renewable energy. We have a target of 500 MW of renewable energy by 2005. We are well on course and that target will be met. AER V, which was announced two weeks ago, will give us another 255 MW and planning permission is <i>in situ </i>for that. There is no doubt about what my Department aspires to do and those targets will be met.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rest of Europe, I understand the UK has a target for 2005 to have 10% of its electricity production from renewable sources. Our target that we will meet is 12%. Countries like Denmark are ahead but we are catching up.</P>

Does he know what those penalties might be? Does he also agree that the Government is failing nationally to imbue in the population as a whole the need for energy conservation and the need to turn to renewable energies in building houses, using cars etc.? There is no sense of urgency. What is he planning to do about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">

Everything that needs to be done has been done. The Green Paper was produced and universally well accepted. That has now been incorporated in Government policy and unprecedented funding for renewables has been put in place in the national development plan. The Irish Energy Centre has been beefed up and is being put on a statutory basis. Pending the legislation, an interim board was put in place. That board has its work programme in hand and is motoring ahead. I am confident our targets will be met.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the re-opening of individual railway lines are matters for the board and management of CIE. I understand from CIE that it has no plans to carry out a feasibility study into the re-opening of the Claremorris to Athenry rail line as the anticipated level of passenger carryings relative to the capital and operating costs would not justify such a service. Passenger services on the line were closed in 1976 and main freight traffic ceased in 1987. Due to the lack of patronage, meaning customers, and in the absence of major development along the rail corridor, I am informed that the re-introduction of passenger services is unlikely to be viable.</P>
      <P>The rail investment programme currently being implemented by Iarnród Éireann, as part of the national development plan, is the largest investment ever made in Ireland's railways. However, these resources are limited and must be utilised so that the best value for money is achieved for the public. Therefore, the investment programme is being implemented in a prioritised manner on the basis of rail safety, customer demand and expected economic return.</P>

As both Deputy Stagg and I know &ndash; and as CIE could testify if it knew what is happening on the ground &ndash; there are hundreds of cars travelling from the south Mayo area to Galway each morning, with people working in offices, shops, factories and hospitals. Is the Minister aware that there is a five mile log-jam of cars at 8 a.m. each morning? It used to stretch to Ballybrit, then to Castlegar and now to Claregalway. The cars are bumper to bumper every morning and evening. I ask the Minister to seriously address the problem in the catchment area of Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry. What is needed is political will. Fianna Fáil backbenchers and candidates have been telling Jim Fahy of RTE that the Minister is going <Col N="831" /> to commission a feasibility study. I can send the footage to the Minister.

      <P>Aer Rianta funds its capital development programme at each of the three State airports, including Cork Airport. A major expansion programme, costing in excess of £60 million, is under way at Cork Airport to facilitate the projected increased growth in passenger numbers and aircraft movements. To meet this demand, Aer Rianta is pursuing a programme to increase the capacity of the terminal building, car parking facilities and the road and airfield infra<Col N="832" /> structures. A number of engineering upgrades have already been carried out and the main runway has been overlaid with asphalt and widened.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Aer Rianta that work will advance this year on a major project to extend the terminal building at Cork. Aer Rianta is currently working on design options for the terminal and this will be followed by the company's application for planning permission for the selected design. The works will then be put out to tender and assuming no delays in the planning process, Aer Rianta expects building to start before the end of this year. A major extension to the apron at Cork is currently in progress. The provision of extra surface car parking and improvements to the internal road system will also proceed this year and commencement of a multi-storey car park, with covered access to the terminal, will follow upon completion of major preliminary earthworks. It is anticipated that the development of the terminal building and car parking facilities will be completed within 15 months of receipt of planning permission. Aer Rianta also plans to provide additional aircraft parking stands, a new link taxiway by July 2002 and a remote apron to accommodate aircraft stands and associated taxiway by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>A new control tower and ancillary accommodation will be constructed on the west side of the airfield directly opposite the terminal building. This will provide a custom built facility, fully equipped with state of the art air traffic management systems by the Irish Aviation Authority. Most of this work will be carried out in 2002. The existing fire station will also receive a major refurbishment to be completed by the end of 2002.</P>

Has she carried out any assessment of that, or does she have any information on that? It is not possible at the moment to take aircraft from America in Cork. What is the Minister doing in regard to the vacancy on the Aer Rianta board? Does she agree it would be important to have somebody from Cork on the board so that the development of Cork Airport could be assisted by somebody from Cork?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 33 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of the Retired Aviation Staff Association. Over the past two years I have responded to numerous representations in relation to the concerns of RASA about the Irish airlines (general employees) Superannuation Scheme. I have also met representatives from this organisation and senior officials from my Department met the association on three occasions over the past year most recently last month. In addition, the association has also met <Col N="834" /> senior management representatives from Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta in relation to their concerns.</P>
    <P>In so far as pension increases under the Irish airline (general employees) superannuation scheme are concerned, I understand from Aer Lingus that the trustees of the scheme have increased pensions in line with the annual consumer price index in keeping with the discretion available to them under the rules of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards pension enhancements in a new scheme to benefit both serving staff and existing pensioners, the companies' position is that these will emerge from negotiations with representatives of staff which are associated with strategic change initiatives. It is Aer Lingus's intention to implement the new pension scheme as soon as possible after the privatisation of the airline is completed.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus management has proposed that in the new scheme, pensions will increase in line with the annual consumer price index provided that it does not exceed 5%. Furthermore, should the CPI exceed 5%, the trustees of the new scheme may at their discretion award further percentage increases to pensions in payment on the basis of advice from the scheme's actuary. It is also proposed that the new scheme will provide improved benefits in areas such as guaranteed pension payments periods and death-in-service benefits. Aer Lingus advise that the overall terms of the proposed new scheme would be in line with practice in the private sector and, in many cases, would have better benefits.</P>
    <P>In so far as Aer Rianta is concerned, the company proposes to establish a new scheme as soon as possible in consultation with staff interests. I understand that new scheme will be along the lines of the new scheme outlined by Aer Lingus. The terms of the proposed new pension schemes are essentially a matter for the companies concerned to negotiate with staff interests. Existing Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners who transfer to the new Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta schemes will receive the improved benefits when the new schemes are introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is hypocritical in the extreme. Does she agree she has strung along these pensioners for the past two years with blather and humbug &ndash; more of what we heard today &ndash; that has nothing at all to do with the case? Does she agree she expressed her sympathy to the pensioners directly about their case, that she was hopeful about the case and that it was her wish that a positive outcome would be achieved, but that recently she refused to meet them? Does the Minister agree that she did not lift a finger after the meetings either between her officials and the pensioners and herself and the pensioners to make the necessary case on their behalf to the Minister for Finance, the chairman of Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta and that their record demonstrates that is the case? Does she agree that her treatment of the 4,500 pensioners is <Col N="835" /> shabby and shameful and that she led them up the garden path and sold them a pup? </P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister appreciate the disappointment, dismay and the anger of pensioners? All one has to do is read the resolutions that came from the recent annual general meeting. I have seldom seen a group of people so aggrieved express so cogently their genuine dismay at the way they were treated. Does the Minister recall that when we raised this matter on 19 October last, we got a very clear indication from the Minister that something was <Col N="836" /> about to happen? That was the clear understanding the Minister conveyed.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that these 4,500 pensioners have a genuine case by virtue of the fact they effectively carried both companies on their backs and made titanic sacrifices in serving the public interest? They now feel that they have been jettisoned and thrown to the wolves. At their time of highest dependency they are on derisory low pensions and the balance will have to be made up. What is the difference between this case and the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes Trust workers? Legislation was, thankfully, brought before this House for the Sweepstakes workers by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to bring their income up to a reasonable level so that they could have a dignified level of existence at this stage of their lives.</P>

She understood the matter and was expressing her sympathy &ndash; which I would say is false sympathy. Will she reiterate to the House that she will not proceed with the IPO or any other form of sale of Aer Lingus until this matter is dealt with? Will she now guarantee that she will not simply get an official to write a statement of fact to the Department of Finance, but that she will be an advocate on behalf of these pensioners? The pensioners have put forward a modified claim; it will cost Aer Lingus £2 million and Aer Rianta £1 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the pensions scheme to which she referred in her answer has nothing to do with this case? It is about a pensions scheme for existing employees. If these pensioners are tied into a scheme where <Col N="837" /> they have their pensions indexed to the cost of living increases &ndash; which are very low despite the fact that wages have been increasing &ndash; in relative terms their pensions will be slashed.

Before the adjournment of the debate Deputies Dukes, Penrose and I made a plea about the need for representation for punters and racegoers on the new authority. We have put this case both on Second Stage and Committee Stage. I think the Minister should reflect on it very seriously before he makes his final decision. These are the people who are the future of the industry. Without crowds the sport does not exist. I implore the Minister not to disregard this amendment, it is one which speaks for most people involved in the industry. Greyhound racing in Britain may be able to operate without crowds which might be all right for television but Irish racing would be nothing without the thousands of people who flock to race tracks year after year. These people need representation, and I hope the Minister is willing &ndash; even at this late stage &ndash; to grant that.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment will be to exclude from membership of the racecourse consultative forum any or all interests who are not racegoers. Who is a racegoer? Racegoers are all those who attend race meetings. The intention here is to establish a forum to give all of those interests, and all of those affected by the decisions of the HRI, an opportunity to voice their opinion. That these opinions be respected by the board is written into a section of the Bill. What we are trying to do is accommodate the very large number of people who go racing. In Ireland, 1.35 million people go racing each year and they are a diverse group and include a wide range of people, without whom racing could not take place. Deputy Dukes mentioned a number of people without whom racing could not take place. A commercial industry could not exist without racegoers.

      <P>In view of the presentation and the debate that has been made, will the Minister ignore the text which he has about the technicalities of this amendment and speak about the substantive issue? Can the Minister tell us if he is going to agree to the proposal that the punters be represented on the board of HRI? All the rest is just window dressing and I can see that in the Minister's smile as he reads out the text.</P>

      <P>All of them will be punters. I want to establish a broadly based forum that will allow the general public and various other interests involved a say in how the industry proceeds. I reached agreement with the industry in October last year, to which Deputy Penrose referred a number of times, after quite a deal of foreplay of various kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No wonder the Minister has a smile on his face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will stand by that deal as any deviation from it would create some unravelling of the structure and I do not intend that. I intend to give a voice and a genuine say in the future running and operation of the industry through the consultative forum. That is why I included in another section that the opinions of the forum would have to be respected and reports would have to be published by the consultative forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons given on Committee Stage, the fact that the board of the HRI, which is envisaged, will not change, as I intend to go ahead with it in the way planned and agreed, and the fact that I will honour the October 2000 memorandum of understanding, I hope the Deputy can accept my reasoning for not wanting to limit or restrict the people or interests that will be represented on the <Col N="840" /> consultative forum or its size or composition. I do not, therefore, have any choice but to oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to confirm that he does not intend there to be representation of punters on the board of the HRI, that he presumes &ndash; he may have foreknowledge of this &ndash; that he knows all those who will be members of the board of the HRI, in which case this process of consultation with the various interests will possibly be a little cosmetic. I also want him to confirm that with regard to the forum, he has no difficulty in selecting representatives of punters because they are among the groups he intends to have represented on it, if I understand him correctly &ndash; he may already know who will be appointed to it, which would not entirely surprise me &ndash; and that he intends this forum will include representatives from various other sectors in the industry, a most laudable basis for consultation.</P>
      <P>If I am right in that, the Minister is saying to punters, &ldquo;we want to hear your views in a forum where there will be one set of views among so many and that we should include all the other interests&rdquo;. He is saying to them, &ldquo;I will put you in a forum, which is the only place you will represented and you will be there alongside a lot of other people in the industry, some of whom, however, are represented on the board&rdquo;. The Minister is saying to them that as far as the running of the whole operation is concerned that although they are the key people, the <i>raison d'être</i> of the business, they will be treated less equally than the people who provide the horses and train them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is doing this as a result of an agreement he and the Minister for Finance arrived at towards the back end of last year to keep those interests happy, vested interests one might call them, and to keep them living together harmoniously. That is what the Minister is saying. It is a great pity this opportunity has been missed to give real representation to the people who are the life-blood of this industry. It is an awful pity the Minister, whose instincts in many cases are surprisingly decent given the party he comes from, has missed this great opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my views known to the Minister. A similar forum was in place in the UK and, as far as I know, it was not successful. The interests of the regular racegoer, the major consumers of this product, should be reflected at board structure. There is no power or influence in being part of what, in effect, is a toothless tiger. It is nothing more than window dressing. It is a sop to the thousands and thousands who frequent race tracks. I know a good deal about the Kilbeggan track. Some 7,000 to 9,000 people have attended it. Those are ordinary people. They do not go around wearing dickie bows. The Minister knows I represent ordinary people and I will speak vehemently on their behalf. Those people may go to the track with their pension books and <Col N="841" /> be glad to get in for £4. They are not part of the cigar brigade, but their views should be represented at board level.</P>
      <P>There was a rush to put the new structure in place. The memorandum of understanding appeared like the Sword of Damocles and the Minister cannot deviate from it. That is the danger of us ceding power to outside bodies. That happened with the NRA and several other similar bodies. Unfortunate people are now the subject of them telling us what to do and we cannot ask a parliamentary question about the running of them.</P>
      <P>This is a consultative forum for what? I have outlined a glaring deficiency in the Bill. It arises from the memorandum of understanding that emerged from the famous meeting on 19 October 2000. The structure of the board should reflect an important section of the racing fraternity. This is an ideal opportunity to ensure that punters' voices are heard where it counts, where there is power and influence. That has not happened in the past. I ask the Minister to consider the principal consumers of this product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to be fair on this matter and give representation and a voice to as broadly a representative group of people as possible. All the representatives on the new board will be punters. Punters were directly represented by a member of the IHA board. I knew the IHA board and I assume I will know the new board because, happily, we tend to know one another in this sector. Under the old order, I got nothing but grief from the lack of representation of punters, even though they had a direct representative on the <Col N="842" /> IHA board. There are race course clubs, race courses supporters clubs and other various interests throughout the country. Tramore has a race course supporters club, as has Galway and many other tracks. There are also the ordinary race course clubs. I considered that a consultative forum of 13 to 15 members was the way to give as broad a representation as possible </P>
      <P>Section 9 provides that the board will be obliged to take their opinions into account. Any fair-minded person on the new HRI board would have to have regard to the views of the consultative forum. Those who will be appointed to the board of the HRI will be punters and the consultative forum will have a direct input into the future of the industry. That is the best way forward for it. Under those circumstances, I regret I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has arrived at this position. He is not being fair in what he is doing. The Minister and the Minister for Finance stitched up a deal with the other interests here. They did not have the backbone to stand up for the punters. The other people on the board may well be punters but they are not on the board in that capacity. The Minister might believe he had grief from punters, given that the last dispensation included a punters' representative on the board, but that is as nothing to the grief he will get from punters from now on.</P>
      <P>I will press this amendment. We will be voting on the Minister's refusal to have a punters' representative on the board.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 34 to 38.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete section 13(4). The subsection states:</P>
      <P>In the performance of his or her duties under this section, the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 deals with a similar provision in relation to Bord na gCon.</P>
      <P>The people who run the state about which George Orwell wrote in <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> would be delighted to see these provisions and would feel very much at home with them. This is naked censorship and an attempt to muzzle the chief executives of two bodies who through the Bill are being given the job of running the horse and dog racing industries for the greater delectation of the public and for the benefit of people involved in the industry. The people who campaign against blood sports would love to see this as it puts a muzzle on the industries to stop them biting the Minister. I do not know why the Minister feels so sensitive about this. Is he afraid that the chief executive of HRI or of Bord na gCon might some day say the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is wrong in doing particular things or that his policy is unwise? I cannot remember a Bill coming before this House which proposed to do anything like that and yesterday was my 20th anniversary as a Member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been here longer than I have been. Not even any of the Minister's predecessors in that benighted party would have proposed something like this. We used to say that Fianna Fáil, for all its faults, was a populist party and that except for a certain period under a little dictator it believed in people being able to speak their minds.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that there are occasions when the chief executives of various State boards can appear to speak out of turn and sometimes this can be inconvenient. If they are doing their jobs properly, they will find occasion from time to time to disagree with the Minister and his Department, but it is outrageous to write into a Bill a piece of McCarthyism of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the kind of advice the Minister got on this matter or the kind of spirit which has moved him to produce these amendments. I wonder would he explain to us why these two subsec<Col N="845" /> tions, which are in sections 13 and 14 respectively, apply to the chief executives and not to the chairpersons of these boards. If the Minister was concerned about the tenderness of his skin and did not want to take criticism, it would seem to me that he would be more inclined to want to muzzle criticism from a chairperson, who would be regarded in the outside world, perhaps wrongly, as being a heavier hitter than the chief executive but instead the Minister has homed in on the chief executives.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is related to the fact that, as the Minister stated earlier, he will know all the members of this board. No doubt he will make sure that he will know them. Perhaps the Minister is counting on the fact that if a chairperson of either of these boards looks like getting out of line, he can call him or her aside for a little chat to say what is what &ndash; that has been known to happen too.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister would provide in legislation for provisions of this kind. It is even more extraordinary that this Bill has been drafted in the normal way, has gone through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government and has been seen by no less a person than the Attorney General. The Attorney General has belatedly woken up to what he thinks is interference in our affairs in Europe. If that Attorney General was half awake, doing his job and vindicating the rights of Irish people, he would not allow a provision like this to be written into a Bill.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister believe he needs this instrument to muzzle people who might question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or of a Minister of the Government or of the merits of the objectives of such a policy? According to these provisions, these people are not now being prevented from simply expressing an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development but are being prevented from expressing an opinion on any policy of the Government or a Minister or on the merits or the objectives of such a policy. The chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland and the chief executive of Bord na gCon, in the performance of their duties, will not be allowed to say anything which would question any policy of any member of the Government. They may not say, for example, that they disagree with the taxation policies of the Minister for Finance which might affect these industries. They may not say they object to any provisions of public health legislation which might apply to race courses under the aegis of the Minister for Health and Children. They may not say they have any criticism of infrastructure provision policy on water supply or sewerage which might come under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. In their capacity as chief executives of either one of these boards, they cannot express an opinion in public on any policy of any member of the Government. <Col N="846" /> If I ever saw a sledgehammer to crack a nut, this is it.</P>
    <P>I perceive that the Minister is a little puzzled by this. Were he to do the decent thing, he would stand up and say that he accepts these two amendments, that he has enough confidence in himself and the kind of policy he proposes not to put this kind of muzzle on the chief executives of two bodies being set up in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Can he tell me of a precedent for a measure like this in any of the legislation enacted since 1922? Have the chief executives of CIE, ESB, Bord Gáis or any of the multiplicity of public sector bodies established over the past 80 years ever been told anything like this? What was the Minister thinking when he put this provision in the Bill? This provision is so blatantly anti-democratic that the Minister should agree immediately to delete it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled an amendment which is broadly in line with those of Deputy Dukes. On Committee Stage we spoke extensively about these amendments and we impressed upon the Minister that it was undesirable for the Bill to contain section 13(4) and section 14(4). I am sure the Minister has reflected on the fairly trenchant views in that regard expressed on that occasion. I hope he has taken cognisance of the views expressed, which reflect the broad view of the Oireachtas, and that he will accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>A chief executive officer would obviously operate independently in the exercise of his or her functions and would work within the confines of the articles of association of the board, but he or she should not be inhibited, muzzled or censored if he or she wanted to express an opinion on the merits of any policy. The provision is so broad as to be tantamount to circumscribing the independence of the holder of the office of chief executive. The provision should be removed totally because it is too broad and invasive. There should be no place for it in the Bill, particularly in current circumstances where the Oireachtas is continually providing for powers to allow for openness, transparency and accountability such as the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>It would be incumbent on the chief executive officer to be free to express in an unbridled way an opinion on any aspect of Government policy. It might be beneficial for the Government to take cognisance of the views of the chief executive of such a fairly significant body. While the organisation will not reflect the views of the punters in the way we wanted, it should still represent the views of the vast bulk of people involved in the industry in a fairly authoritative way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shows a lack of confidence on the part of the Minister. As there are significant moneys being voted to this body, it is unlikely that criticism would arise in the context of its financial position but criticism could arise regarding some aspect of policy, not only of areas within the responsibility of the Mini<Col N="847" /> ster for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development but of areas covered by other Departments which would impinge, directly or indirectly, upon the free and untrammelled operation of the authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity today, by the removal of this provision, to ensure the chief executive officer will not, in any way, be hamstrung in the performance of his or her duties. The drafting office made a major slip-up in including this particular provision in the Bill. I was surprised, from day one, at its inclusion and I am equally surprised it remains in the Bill on the final day of its discussion. I have no doubt the Minister has given some thought to this matter and I anticipate he will do the honourable thing and accede to our amendments to delete sections 13(4) and 14(4). To do so would be a sign of maturity and confidence. A chief executive officer appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with various aspects should be entitled to say what he or she feels is a lacuna or negative in relation to Government policy in this area. Acceptance of these amendments would be to everyone's advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. The unamended section contains an extraordinary provision which would create a very negative imposition on the legislation.</P>
      <P>The possibility of the State having too much of a hold over Irish racing has raised many doubts about the Bill. I would not have agreed with that objection. Those who had such worries and who were concerned about Irish racing becoming too beholden to the Government feel this particular section justifies their argument. To impose on any chief executive the provision that he cannot comment or criticise Government policy as it relates to the industry over which he or she is to preside is negative, damaging and dangerous. It is something more akin to the type of legislation enacted in eastern European countries in the 1950s and 1960s. I see no reason this provision should remain in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer, who will be charged with responsibility for developing our racing industry and ensuring its expansion, must be in a position to make known his or her views when Government policy impacts on the racing industry, be they supportive or critical. Deputy Penrose pointed out that the Bill contains a provision requiring the chief executive to appear before Oireachtas committees. Will the chief executive officer have to pass on some questions if a member raises an issue which might result in criticism of Government policy? It is unfair to tie the hands of the chief executive officer to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be important that the chief executive officer is in a position to make known his or her views when taxation or other measures, as they apply to the racing industry, are being proposed and debated by Government or politicians in general. One would hope that the chief executive <Col N="848" /> officer's opinion on proposed improvements would be favourable on the majority of occasions. There may, however, be times when a word of criticism may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes asked if any other legislation which passed through this House contains such a provision. Is any other chief executive officer or chairman of a State board constrained in this manner? The answer to that question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Difficulties may arise from time to time, they may be rare, with a person at that level indicating a difficulty with Government policy. It will be a helpful check and balance if the person appointed as chief executive officer of Horse Racing Ireland feels free and able to comment on issues affecting his or her industry.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the overall structure of the Bill and the Government's commitment in this area. I hope the next Government will have the same commitment to racing. I would not like to see Irish horse racing so beholden to a Minister or Government of any persuasion that the chief executive officer has to have his hands tied behind his back to the extent provided for in this legislation. I look forward to the Minister's response. I do not see any justification for the proposed degree of censorship. It is important, in an industry as big as horse racing, that we listen to a broad spectrum of opinion and act upon it if necessary. I am sure what the Minister is proposing to do during his time in office will be supported by the new chief executive officer. We cannot speak about the next Administration or what other Administration will be in place in 20 years time. We cannot say what will be the view of any future Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. We may be guaranteed funding under this legislation but policy could become very different. It is important that the chief executive officer be, on occasion, absolutely free to say what he or she feels about Government policy. This provision must be removed from the Bill. Can the Minister justify what he is trying to do? I cannot see any reason to include this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments refer to the proposed deletion of sections 13(4) and 14(4). The sections refer to the audit and presentation to the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts of the annual accounts for the HRI and Bord na gCon. They require the chief executive officers, in each case, to attend the committee and give evidence on the regularity and probity of the accounts for the year. Like the board, I assume I, too, will know the chief executive. The position of chief executive will be publicly advertised in both instances and the appointment will be made by an independent body. The Minister of the day will have no say in the matter.</P>

    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts is a forum used solely for examining accounts at issue. It will examine financial matters in relation to the two bodies concerned. I want Deputies to note that the restriction on chief executives is not included <Col N="849" /> in section 15 under which the same chief executives will be called before any other Oireachtas committee to discuss policy and various directional matters. It was my understanding that, based on this clarification which I also gave on Committee Stage, Deputies were happy to withdraw the amendments.</P>

      <P>I admire the Minister's ability in dancing. He will go down in history with very interesting people &ndash; Vladimir llich Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Lavrenti Beria and Eric Honeker &ndash; who felt they needed this kind of control. The Minister has a short memory because it is not that many months since the Committee of Public Accounts conducted an investigation which went much deeper than concern with just the accounts of bodies under its remit. It would be inappropriate for that committee to feel it could not ask the chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Authority or Bord na gCon for a view on policy. I am sure there are occasions when the committee, in speaking to the Accounting Officers of various Departments comes across events or incidents where they will tell the committee they cannot elaborate on the answer to a question because it is a matter of policy. One does not need to be an expert to know that the Accounting Officer believes the policy to be unwise but is bound in loyalty to remain mute on the point. I do not know if that is a good idea because although others may hold different views, I believe that, by and large, Ministers get very good advice from Accounting Officers.</P>
      <P>However, Ministers can get bad advice from Attorneys General. No Bill that was found to be unconstitutional was not passed by an Attorney General. In this instance the Minister has received bad advice from the Attorney General and he can delete these provisions without doing any damage to the system to be established by the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused because I thought the Minister was to amend the section. The only feasible amendment is to delete it because it serves no purpose other than to constrain the person involved from expressing an opinion on the merits of any Government policy. The Minister has indicated he is not concerned with restricting the chief executive in this way. Why, therefore, will he not delete the section? While I am sure the Minister will not use the section it will be used by somebody else who, in referring to the provisions of this legislation, will tell the chief executive he cannot express any opinions on Government policy. Given the nature of the Committee of Public Accounts, attempts will be made to elicit the chief executive's views on policy at which point he will say that unfortunately he cannot comment because of this provision. Some such comments may be positive but others will be negative in so far as it may be the view of the chief executive that aspects of Government policy will not benefit the industry. <Col N="850" /> He should be free to express such views. There is no point in dividing on this point. I ask the Minister to see the sense of our argument and accede to our reasonable request.</P>

      <P>I am broadly in agreement with the Opposition Members. The racing industry greatly appreciates the huge interest taken in it by the Minister and the Minister for Finance, including the benefits and security they are trying to give to the future of the industry. However, I see no sense in introducing this unnecessary control. Perhaps we will be in Opposition after the next general election &ndash; Deputy Dukes will get long odds on that &ndash; and if so, I would like to think that we could elicit opinions from the chief executive on policy matters. The phrase used in the section, &ldquo;shall not question&rdquo;, refers to days that are long gone. I hope we do not return to them.</P>
      <P>Chief executives of State bodies make measured contributions. We should not attempt to restrict them but should be aware of their responsibilities and rights. The kind of blind loyalty sought by this section is unnecessary and unhealthy. It is not that long ago that difference of views were expressed on the debate in the House on the muzzling of greyhounds. I do not believe there is any great necessity to muzzle the chief executive of this new board.</P>

I was happy to introduce provisions regarding the muzzling of greyhounds. It has worked well, has removed the cruelty from the sport and allowed coursing to continue and be enjoyed by many people, apart from this year when it was unable to be held. No doubt it will flourish again next year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 8, after &ldquo;interests&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having regard to the overall geographical dispersal of such interests&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am focused on the geographical dispersal aspect and I ask the Minister to bring it to the attention of the board. The ITBA is the organisation for the thoroughbred horse industry and it is recognised by the Minister. However, as we are aware from the discussion on the previous Bill, not all thoroughbred breeders are happy with the representation, particularly the national hunt sector. Approximately 6,000 breeders are registered by Weatherbys Ireland and it is generally accepted that 50% of them breed horses for the flat while the other 50% breed national hunt horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ITBA only represents 10% of thoroughbred breeders, but it concerns me that some geographical areas have much greater representation than others. There are approximately 160 national hunt breeders in Westmeath, but the problem is that only 5% are members of the ITBA. In Meath, there are 350 flat breeders and only 30% are members of the ITBA. Kildare, which, as Deputy Power knows, is the kingdom of flat breeders, has 500 breeders and 50% are <Col N="852" /> members of the ITBA. I recently got nosey and looked at the geographical dispersal of the members of the ITBA council for 1999 to 2000. There are 19 elected members, but 80% &ndash; 16 members &ndash; came from three counties. Seven members were from Kildare while five were from Meath and three were from Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Meath and Tipperary are seriously over-represented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not need to tell the Minister not to forget Cork. That will be a <i>sine qua non</i> of any legislation. However, 1,500 members were represented by 80% of the council. They were mostly flat breeders but the remaining 4,500 members, or 75%, had just three representatives at council level in the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association &ndash; one each from Kilkenny, Wexford and Down. Breeders from the rest of Ireland did not have an elected representative at council level.</P>
      <P>I hope that whatever system is put in place does not perpetuate the election of members from the same geographical areas. This is why I want a geographical spread. This would be fair because there is inequality in the representation of flat and national hunt breeders. This is because not all breeders are affiliated to the ITBA and it is why I use every opportunity in the House to represent the important views of people involved in national hunt racing.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of horses such as Pigeon's Nest and many people in my area bred some very good horses. However, they have different views from those echoed at ITBA council level. I ask the Minister to ensure that the geographical dispersal reflects the location of national hunt breeders. They should have a reasonable say because their concerns are different from those of flat breeders. Their views should be represented and echoed in the portals of power in the context of the new authority. I ask the Minister to ensure that happens. This issue should be brought to the attention of the chief executive. I noticed the geographical spread during a lazy perusal of the membership of the council. The figures related to the council for 1999 to 2000 and perhaps the position has changed since then. However, I ask the Minister to ensure this aspect is addressed. I do not intend to press the amendment but I want to alert the Minister to this matter.</P>

In most representative bodies, the number of people who partici<Col N="853" /> pate in the body's activities tends to be much smaller than the total membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed several bodies in detail earlier in the year and a minority of members elect the office holders. This can be a problem.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has a solution to the other problem. How can he have regard to the overall geographical dispersal if one person will be nominated to represent authorised race courses, another will represent race horse owners and another will represent trainers, etc? I do not know how geographical dispersal can be addressed in terms of one person. In taking all the categories together, it appears Deputy Penrose ultimately wants representation from throughout the country. However, it could be the case, particularly given the prominence of Kildare in this area, that the board has a person from the Curragh representing authorised race courses, a person from the Maynooth area representing race owners, a person from Maddenstown representing race horse breeders and a close associate of Deputy Power's representing authorised bookmakers.</P>
      <P>This would be justifiable because all the people in County Kildare would serve the industry extremely well. However, Deputy Penrose's point is that, somewhere along the line, some of the other counties should get a chance. I am sure Deputy Power would agree that we could afford to be that generous.</P>

      <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Penrose and supported by Deputy Dukes that a geographical spread is desirable. It is desirable in many professions, but it is almost impossible to achieve. However, I will convey the strongly voiced recommendation of the House that consideration should be given by the ITBA to geographical spread, although when it involves one person it cannot be done at a particular time.</P>
      <P>The Schedule contains a provision that will ensure a turnover of the board's members. It states that on the anniversary of the establishment of the HRI and thereafter on each anniversary of such establishment, three of the ordinary members of HRI shall retire from office. I will convey the Deputy's views to the ITBA that, in the turnover of its membership, it should make an allowance for geographical spread.</P>

The horse racing and breeding industry is very important economically and socially to the country and gives us a status internationally that other domestic industries would not give us. The weekend of the Epsom Derby was a great indication of this where on Friday and Saturday we had winners of the Oaks and Derby. Indeed at yesterday's Royal Ascot meeting, the St. James's Palace Stakes was won by an Irish bred and trained horse. Before we came in here some of the Members had the opportunity to watch some of the early racing today. I had a modest punt today on Mozart. I thought he was dead long ago but he ran very well and stayed on to win by a neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of the contributions was outstanding. We obviously have an industry in which there is a tremendously keen interest.

The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the transfer of the State guaranteed debt, which is £193 million, to the Minister for Finance. It provides for the Minister for Finance to transfer the debt to the National Treasury Management Agency where it can be managed as part of the national debt. Once passed, this Bill will enable the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make orders at future dates to repeal all previous NET legislation and to remove the applicability to NET of the Worker Participation in State Enterprises Acts, 1977 and 1988.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I apologise for the delay. The primary purpose of this Bill is to allow me, as the shareholder in the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, to discharge certain functions which are essential if the proposed sale of the INPC's business and principal commercial assets, chiefly the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy oil terminal, to the Tosco Corporation is to proceed to completion. The Bill also includes a number of provisions which could be activated at some stage in the future in the unlikely event that the current sale process cannot be completed.</P>
      <P>The House may be aware that on 26 May last, legal documents were signed which commit the INPC and the Tosco Corporation to a completion date of 16 July, subject to the fulfilment of certain pre-completion conditions, including the enactment of enabling legislation by the Oireachtas. That is why the Government agreed to give priority attention to this Bill, despite the many pressing items in its overall legislative programme, and I am very appreciative that the Houses have agreed to facilitate the matter.</P>
      <P>The INPC was established in 1979 during the so-called second oil shock in the context that a number of oil producing countries had made it known that they would provide incremental oil supplies only on a state to state basis.</P>
      <P>Given the urgency of the situation, it was decided to establish the INPC as a private limited company under the Companies Acts, with the Government as shareholder, rather than have recourse to the more usual method of establishment as a statutory State body with its own dedicated legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982, as part of the oil industry's response to a downturn in world demand for oil products, the original private sector owners of the Whitegate refinery withdrew from the facility. The refinery was then acquired by the State and <Col N="857" /> responsibility for its operation was entrusted to the INPC. In 1986, the INPC also became responsible for the management of the Whiddy oil terminal after the facility was gifted to the State by Chevron, the then owner. Chevron also paid the State a sum of US$44 million to be released from its contractual obligations to reactivate the facility or to restore the site to greenfield status, following the <i>Betelgeuse</i> accident of 1979 which had effectively closed the facility. In the event, Whiddy continued to lie dormant until the installation of a single point mooring facility made the tanks accessible once again in 1998.</P>
    <P>From the outset there were problems with Whitegate, as the companies operating in the Irish market refused to do business with the refinery.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that copies of my script have not arrived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputies do. I thank Deputy Higgins.</P>
      <P>In response, an arrangement known as the mandatory regime, or MR, was introduced, which compelled those companies to source a fixed proportion, originally set at 35%, of their overall requirements from Whitegate at a premium price which was passed on to the consumer as a levy at the pumps. The price support system was necessary to enable the refinery to stay in business notwithstanding its technical limitations and the other factors which militated against it operating on a fully commercial basis.</P>
      <P>While the capabilities of the refinery have been improved in the interim, its basic drawbacks have remained and have been a continued source of uncertainty over the years. Whitegate, for example, lacks scale, technical sophistication and the benefits of integration with the more profitable sectors of the oil business. It operates in a market which is dominated by the local affiliates of the multinational oil companies and is entirely dependent in commercial terms on international refining margins, which are completely outside its control and which are more often negative than positive. Not surprisingly, and despite dedicated and highly professional service from INPC's management and staff over two decades, the threat of closure has never been far away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, State ownership and in particular the availability of financial support under the mandatory regime has provided a lifeline for the INPC and has ensured that Ireland has been able to retain the benefit of the strategically significant facilities operated by the company. At the same time, it has been a poor substitute for a proper commercial environment for the company within the mainstream oil industry. Successive Governments have been concerned about the potential threat to competitiveness posed by the MR and as the arrangement is subject to annual review, Ministers in charge of the energy <Col N="858" /> portfolio and the INPC itself have always had to live with the prospect that MR support and, consequently, the refinery might not survive from one year to the next.</P>
    <P>As I have said often and not with any tone of censure, the previous Government took a Cabinet decision to abolish the mandatory regime levy but within three or four months rescinded that decision. Dependence on the MR has tended to become especially worrying whenever the necessity for investment at the refinery has arisen. This occurred most recently in the context of the need to adapt the refinery to ensure that its products would be able to meet new emission standards for motor fuels under the EU auto oil 1 programme, which were to be effective from the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The proposal that went to Government at that time seeking approval for the auto oil investment, the cost of which was then estimated at US$100 million, made it abundantly clear that there was no prospect of the INPC raising the necessary finance without the assurance of MR support at a level commensurate with the need to make loan repayments in addition to compensating for ongoing operational losses. I am glad the Government was prepared to accept my recommendations and allow the INPC to proceed with its proposed upgrading project, which eventually entailed expenditure of US$75 million. Otherwise, there was no doubt but that the refinery would have had to close once the new environmental standards came into force and that Ireland would have lost an important contributor to security and diversity of oil supply.</P>
    <P>The assessment of the auto oil project had the effect of highlighting the certainty that Whitegate could not maintain operations and service its debts on the basis of income from refining alone and, consequently, would continue to require MR support for the foreseeable future. Concerned at this prospect, the Government therefore requested the INPC to seek out possibilities for additional commercial activities to underpin the core refining business. Nothing was prescribed and nothing was ruled out. It was a question of INPC using its best efforts to come up with options that could be identified and developed into workable proposals.</P>
    <P>The INPC responded to that challenge with exemplary enthusiasm and energy and after an extensive and professionally-conducted search process, the INPC board recommended to me a proposal submitted by the US-based Tosco Corporation as representing by far the best and most forward-looking prospect for the INPC and the State. This assessment was confirmed by my expert advisers and last July the Government was therefore prepared to permit the INPC to confer preferred bidder status on that company.</P>
    <P>There followed almost a year of very intensive activity as the proposal was refined and developed. This phase included a direct role for my officials and those of the Minister for Finance who, with the help of independent financial and legal experts, have worked to ensure that share<Col N="859" /> holder interests were fully addressed at all stages of the process.</P>
    <P>I am aware there was impatience at times because of the amount of attention given on the shareholder's side of the table to the small print of the proposed sale and purchase agreement. While I can understand the frustrations in some quarters, I make no apologies for the diligence of the officials and advisers concerned &ndash; it is no more than we have a right to expect when the disposal of State assets is in question and it makes for a more stable settlement in the long run.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the process is a proposal which I have been prepared to recommend to my Cabinet colleagues because I consider it to be in the best interests of the INPC and its workforce, the State and the economy generally. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the INPC will receive US$100 million from Tosco and will retain the proceeds from existing debtors. The INPC will be paid for its trading stocks at market prices on completion of the sale and will retain certain stocks originally acquired, at the direction of the Government, in 1990 for strategic rather than trading purposes.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, however &ndash; I must be clear about this &ndash; the net proceeds to the Exchequer will be considerably less than the headline figure of US$100 million I have mentioned. This is chiefly because the INPC will continue to be liable for the existing debt of about £70 million, most of it due to the auto oil 1 loan, and for existing liabilities to trade creditors. An ESOP for INPC employees will also have to be funded out of the sale proceeds. Nonetheless, while the final arithmetic at the time of completion will be influenced by,<i> inter alia,</i> oil price and currency fluctuations in the interim, the overall result will be a positive transfer to the State and this is considered to be a very satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>However, the principal benefit of the transaction from the State's perspective is the fact that for the first time in almost 27 years, there can be a solid basis for the future of both the refinery and the terminal, and for the strategic contribution they make to our economy. A central plank in the Tosco proposal is a written undertaking to operate and invest in the facilities on a fully commercial basis for at least 15 years while maintaining existing jobs and conditions of employment. I have been given to understand by Tosco's chief executive officer that in the corporation's plans for the Irish acquisitions, 15 years is only the beginning.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the national significance of this aspect of the proposal. Since 1982, the State has been prepared to support INPC through the operation of the mandatory regime because of the strategic significance of having refining capacity on the island but, as we have seen, that stewardship was a poor substitute for a proper commercial environment. The proposed deal with the Tosco Corporation offers the <Col N="860" /> prospect of a secure and prosperous future for the refinery and the terminal in the context of a major player in the oil industry which has the resources and the incentive to operate and develop these assets in its own commercial interests. This means that the contribution that these facilities make to our oil supply security are thereby secured at least cost to taxpayers and consumers and on a basis that represents a significant improvement on the State's own ability to make commitments under the MR or any possible alternative support mechanism. Although not a household name on this side of the Atlantic, Tosco Corporation is a multi-billion dollar undertaking whose resource base will increase later in the year when it is expected to merge with the US oil giant, the Phillips Petroleum Corporation. Already the third largest refiner and marketer of oil products in the US, Tosco enjoys substantial benefits in terms of operational scale, technological capabilities, business integration and operating synergies that could never be replicated for Whitegate as a stand-alone facility. The INPC facilities will find a niche within the overall Tosco business plan, adding value to the extended Tosco family while continuing to serve the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Acquiring the Irish facilities is a very significant first step outside the US for Tosco and not one that the corporation is taking lightly. From a purely business perspective, Tosco has not only the resources but also the clear incentive in terms of its own self-interest to honour its commitments under the proposed transaction by making a success of its acquisitions in this country, now and in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House contains provisions which are a prerequisite for completing the proposed transaction and are consequently necessary to ensure that Ireland secures the benefits I have already mentioned. It has been clear for some time that because INPC is not a statutory State body, legislation of this kind would be necessary to underpin the proposed transaction. However, it was only in recent weeks, with the signing of the legal documents, that we had an assurance that there was a definite deal on the table and a clear indication of the provisions that would have to be enshrined in the proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains two principal provisions that go to the heart of the Minister's functions in relation to the completion of the proposed sale. In the first place, section 6 empowers me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to authorise INPC to dispose of its assets, including its shares in the subsidiaries that operate the refinery and the terminal, to the purchaser, and this is obviously fundamental to the whole transaction.</P>
    <P>The section also allows me to authorise the INPC to make payments in relation to the establishment and funding of a trust in order to provide for an employee share ownership plan, or ESOP, to facilitate the proposed sale. The establishment of such a scheme in order to secure the co-operation and assistance of INPC's workforce <Col N="861" /> in the implementation of the new arrangements is a pre-condition for the completion of the deal. Following a number of meetings between union representatives, the company and officials of my Department and the Department of Finance, agreement has been reached on a specific offer in relation to a proposed ESOP which the unions have recommended to their members. I further understand that the offer is currently the subject of a ballot, the result of which should be known in the near future.</P>
    <P>Section 7 gives me the authority, once again with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to provide a guarantee in respect of certain potential liabilities of the INPC. Such a guarantee is not unusual in a transaction of this kind. The potential liabilities in question, which include potential environmental risks, are based on the general principle that INPC is liable for issues which pre-date the sale while Tosco will be liable for matters relating to post-completion circumstances. However, within that general framework, and as a result of the very hard bargaining that took place on this particular aspect of the proposed transaction, there are now very significant limits in place in terms of both time and money on the extent of INPC's &ndash; and hence the State's &ndash; potential exposure. In money terms, that liability is capped at US$75 million and the terms of the guarantee will expire over varying periods, the longest of which is 12 years, depending on the nature of the risk.</P>
    <P>The one exception to the above relates to the jetty at Whiddy Island which was destroyed by fire in the 1979 disaster. The derelict structure is completely non-productive and neither Tosco nor any other commercial company could be expected to take responsibility for it. Consequently, the State will continue to bear the potential liability it acquired in relation to the jetty when it took over the terminal in 1986 and for which it was compensated at the time.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the INPC that it should be possible to insure against the environmental risks covered by the guarantee for a relatively modest once-off payment and the company is actively pursuing this aspect at my request.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the Minister for Public Enterprise on an annual basis to lay before each House a statement setting out the amount of any payment which was made during the year under the guarantee together with an indication of the amount covered by the guarantee that was outstanding at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The State's interest in INPC's facilities over the years has been rooted in the contribution which they make to security of oil supply. A further major element in our oil security apparatus is the maintenance of a 90 day oil reserve in line with our obligations in the context of EU legislation and the emergency oil sharing arrangements maintained by the International Energy Agency. Since 1995, responsibility for maintaining these reserves has been a matter for the National Oil Reserves Agency, or NORA as it is more com<Col N="862" /> monly called. Although NORA is a subsidiary of the INPC, I have expressly excluded it from the terms of the proposed sale. NORA does not perform a commercial function but acts as my agent and is the custodian of oil stocks which have been acquired on the basis of a dedicated levy on consumers and taken out of the market to be set aside for strategic purposes. Arrangements are being made to ensure that NORA will continue to function within the public sector. The agency, which had separate representation throughout the talks with Tosco, will enter into arm's length commercially based contracts in respect of storage of a volume of its stocks at Whiddy and Whitegate. This is only to be expected as NORA needs to have stocks in Ireland for strategic reasons and the main available tankage is situated at Whitegate and Whiddy. NORA has other commercial storage contracts at home and abroad and will continue to welcome further competitively priced bids from storage providers.</P>
    <P>To provide a clear legal basis for the safeguarding of strategic stocks in the context of the Tosco transaction, I propose to table an amendment on Committee Stage which will allow me, notwithstanding the provisions of any other legislation, to order, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the transfer of the agency and its stocks out of the INPC. The proposed amendment will also provide for the transfer from INPC of the stocks which were acquired by the corporation in 1990 during the Gulf crisis specifically for strategic purposes, before NORA came into being. The intention is to ensure that these stocks can continue to be reserved for Ireland's strategic purposes as part of NORA's overall stockholding in the wake of the disposal of INPC's other assets to Tosco Corporation.</P>
    <P>These are the provisions of the legislation that impinge directly or indirectly on the proposed sale. At the same time, some account has to be taken of the possibility, however unlikely it may be, that the proposed transaction for one reason or another might not proceed to completion. I am, therefore, taking the opportunity to include provisions in the legislation to permit a share sale to another purchaser or purchasers in the future and to allow INPC to implement an ESOP, in the event that the sale to Tosco is not completed.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, these particular provisions will not have to be acted on and the transaction will go ahead to completion. For too long, the INPC facilities have had to operate a stop-gap arrangement characterised by uncertainty, limited planning horizons and less than optimum levels of investment. We now have the opportunity for the refinery and the terminal to thrive in their natural environment, as part of a major oil company, which has the resources, the incentive and the cultural disposition to invest in and develop the business. These strategically significant resources will be retained for the country, but on the basis of robust business models rather than artificial and ultimately inadequate support mechanisms. I am particularly gratified that the Government, in <Col N="863" /> sanctioning the essential auto oil investment back in 1999 and in directing INPC's attention towards the potential for new commercial arrangements, was instrumental in bringing us to a position where we can look forward with confidence to a bright future for INPC's business and facilities and the contribution it makes to our economic life.</P>
    <P>In some important respects, however, there will be no change. The facilities at Whitegate and Whiddy will continue to operate under existing regulations governing safety, the protection of the environment and the use of stocks in the event of an emergency, irrespective of the new ownership, and with the existing INPC personnel still at their posts.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all those in INPC who have kept the oil flowing over the years. It is remarkable that despite what must often have seemed a bleak and dispiriting outlook, INPC and its staff can look back on an exemplary record on productivity, industrial harmony and safe and environmentally friendly operations. I know others join me in that tribute which is very deeply felt. I was twice there and I found the whole working environment extraordinarily friendly and co-operative. There is a great atmosphere in the place and all of the employees were extremely forthcoming and open. They are a great bunch at all levels including workers and management. They work very closely together and there are very few blocks between them. They seem to ebb and flow between each other in an extremely open way.</P>
    <P>Now, for the first time in 20 years, there is the prospect of job security and career development as part of a major oil company that has the ability and the motivation to invest in its people and its plant. I congratulate INPC management and staff past and present on their achievements over the years. A word of appreciation must go to the board and its chairman together with the chief executive officer and all those whose enthusiasm, dedication and sound instinct for a good business opportunity have brought us to the threshold of a new lease of life for INPC and its people.</P>
    <P>Last week, senior officials of my Department and the chairman and chief executive officer of INPC met the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport to explain and discuss what is involved in the current proposals. They were very courteously received and I know my officials considered the forum to have been a very positive and useful means of addressing and clarifying concerns, which are no doubt shared by other members of the House. I hope the committee members found the occasion equally worthwhile and that it will have compensated in some measure for the limitations, which have of necessity been placed on the time available to debate the matter here in the House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to participating in this evening's debate.</P>

It is our one and only State oil refinery.

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am not stuck for anything to say and if Deputy Daly holds on he will see that I have plenty to say about it. Would it not have been much better and wiser to wait until we have a definitive decision from the workers next week as to whether they will accept the proposals on offer?</P>
      <P>There are three vital considerations as regards the sale of the INPC assets: the economy, the consumer and the employees. From the point of view of the economy, oil is both metaphorically and literally vital in order to grease the wheels of the economy. It is as essential to the economy and the national interest as food is for human survival. It was that strategic consideration that dictated the take-over of the Whitegate refinery by the Government in 1982. In the intervening 19 years Whitegate has served this country well.</P>
      <P>Various Governments have emphasised the strategic importance of having our own oil refinery. It provided a crucial guarantee and insurance during times of oil crises. Its benefits were evident most recently during the Gulf crisis. Its relevance has become even more important in the context of the contraction of refining capacity over the past 20 years. The Whitegate refinery produces propane, butane, premium, super and Euro unleaded, gasoline, diesel, heating oil and heavy fuel oils. It also has the capacity to produce aviation jet fuel.</P>
      <P>It has 157 permanent employees. As the Minister said it operates in a very positive culture and environment for 365 days a year, 24 hours a day and produces products, which can compare favourably and compete with the best imported products on the international market.</P>
      <P>Whitegate has a long history of safety and trouble free working conditions. This includes an impeccable industrial relations record. The refinery provides training for apprentices and third level students. The staff is extremely well skilled. Whitegate provides fire and safety training for most of the marketing oil companies as well as the chemical plants in the greater Cork region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key features of the refinery is the manner in which management has displayed an <Col N="865" /> acute awareness of its environmental responsibility. Oil refining by its nature is not an environmentally friendly industry. It poses obvious and considerable challenges to the environment. Considerable emphasis has been placed by Whitegate management on keeping the environment clean. Local beaches such as Whitebeg and Corkbeg have not been affected by the proximity of the refinery. The very successful Trabolgan holiday complex is located nearby. Whitegate has its social clubs, playing pitches and pitch and putt course, most of which are made available to the local community. Its safety record is second to none and has won numerous national and international safety awards.</P>
    <P>The importance of Whitegate is obvious from the point of view of the economy of the region in which it is located. However, it is the national strategic interest that is really important. As an island nation should we sell off our one and only State owned oil refinery? Is the sale of the refinery as inevitable as the Minister is telling the House today? Would it not have been much better from the point of view of guarantee of oil supplies and stocks to have entered a strategic alliance rather than a complete sell off?</P>
    <P>First of all, there is the sale price of $100 million. However, when one sets against the sale price the fact that the State is to pick up the tab for the outstanding liability of £70 million, one sees clearly that there is little if any financial return. Furthermore, the State has agreed to underwrite the costs of possible environmental claims against the company.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat intrigued by the elaborate deal that has been worked out whereby risks that pre-date the sale will be covered by the State and risks that post-date the sale are to be covered by Tosco. When a company is making such an acquisition, why did it not carry out a very comprehensive investigation of all aspects of what it is buying? If I were buying a house, I would get an engineer to go in and ensure that all aspects of the construction and delivery of the house were complete. For example, why was a full inventory not carried out covering the building, plant, machinery and the site? Is there something latent there that might at some stage erupt?</P>
    <P>The Minister said she is optimistic and will bring before the House the details of whatever insurance arrangements are put in place. However, one has to ask why should the taxpayer, even in a pre-dated agreement, have to bear the cost in respect of a take-over by a multi-million pound conglomerate as large as Tosco? </P>
    <P>With regard to the value-for-money argument which has been put forward, section 7 of the Bill gives a guarantee that the State will cover possible further liabilities up to a maximum of $75 million. Then, as the Minister has said, there is the NORA consideration. The 90-day oil reserve guarantee has been crucial to the national interest. Since 1995, the National Oil Reserve Agency has had responsibility for overseeing this guarantee. In spite of such a vital strategic con<Col N="866" /> sideration, this was not included in the agreement with Tosco in its present state. Poor NORA seems to have been divorced from the deal, cut adrift completely and is now the victim of some kind of convoluted marriage with a whole series of different agencies. The price at which oil can be bought on the spot market is also a factor.</P>
    <P>Of course, the deal which is before the House today has our good wishes, but the legislation does not spell out the specifics. What we are seeking &ndash; this will be teased out on Committee and Report Stages &ndash; is publication of the maximum possible amount of information, including, if possible, the actual agreement between INPC and Tosco. This is a vital national asset and there should be an obligation on the Government to make available the agreement which the Government and the INPC are entering into with a private corporation, including the small print.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the people of Ireland, we want clarification as to how well copper-fastened are the guarantees and assurances which are supposed to be part and parcel of the deal. Does the agreement between Tosco and the INPC guarantee continuity of supply and a supply of the full range of existing products? Does it retain and offer the output of the refinery to the domestic market prior to exporting the product? Does it ensure that refining products sold in Ireland are allocated fairly and offered at market price? Does it respect existing customer relationships? Does it take account of the strategic role of the national refinery in meeting the energy needs of the State not alone in normal times, but also in times of crisis? Does it recognise the important role the national refinery plays in meeting commercial needs of Irish owned fuel companies? Does it recognise the impact of the national refinery operations and competition in the retail price of fuel? Does it establish and respect an independent dispute resolution mechanism for disputes between consumers and the national refinery? Does it allow Irish fuel companies to contribute to and use the facilities of Whitegate to distribute fuel by road and sea?</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the sale of Whitegate will have enormous implications for the indigenous Irish fuel companies. These seven companies are extremely worried about this deal. They operate and compete in a market that is dominated by four large foreign owned companies, Esso, Shell, Texaco and Statoil which, between them, hold the lion's share of the market, a combined share of 74%. Being able to source fuel supplies from the national refinery in Whitegate is essential to the capacity of these seven indigenous companies to compete with major oil companies. The national oil refinery has given Irish companies an opportunity to offer vigorous competition and choice to their customers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The new owners of the INPC facilities in Whitegate will have a monopoly over oil refining from now on. If they place restrictions on the supplies available to the indigenous Irish companies, <Col N="867" /> the consequences are obvious. These Irish companies will be squeezed out of the market and the customer will lose the benefit of competitive pricing which exists at present. I fully empathise with the fears of these Irish companies. Have guarantees been sought or given that this will not happen? Surely, protection for the indigenous companies must be built in? That is something which Fine Gael will seek to enshrine in the legislation and we will bring forward constructive amendments on Committee Stage to give effect to this. The sale of the INPC assets raises many issues of national and regional importance concerning the sale and supply of fuel in Ireland. There are serious national strategic issues involved in the disposal of such a State asset to a non-national, indeed a non-EU, commercial undertaking that will operate such an asset on purely commercial grounds.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider a new role for the INPC, which is to remain in existence after the disposal of its refining assets. We are entering a very exciting phase for oil and gas exploration off the Irish coast. The Corrib gas find is a major incentive and encouragement for exploration companies to drill more wells here. Coming in the wake of the expiry of the Old Head of Kinsale gas find, it has invested the industry with huge new and welcome credibility that Ireland is carbon rich terrain. However, when one examines the tax regime enshrined in the Finance Act, 1992, one could be forgiven for thinking that we have given away the family silver. We have no royalties in this country. Our corporation tax is a mere 25% compared to a world average of 50% and a Norwegian rate of 70%. Furthermore, the exploration companies can offset all their exploration and well development costs against their tax.</P>
    <P>Now that a whole new era of oil and gas exploration is about to unfold along the west coast and elsewhere around the Irish coastline, surely the time is opportune for the Government to create an entirely new role for the INPC. The Government should seriously consider encouraging the INPC to enter the exploration stakes with the oil companies on a shared risk basis, thereby ensuring hands-on control for the first time since exploration began in the 1970s, but will the Government embark on such a course or will it simply abjectly succumb to the dictates and dominance of the oil and gas companies which are about to harvest excellent returns for their investment on the offshore waters of Ireland?</P>
    <P>I wish to be positive and supportive in this development and I am delighted that the workers and their jobs are to be safeguarded. I wonder how well copper-fastened is the 15 year guarantee in relation to the jobs? Is there an absolute assurance that that guarantee is nailed down? Are we absolutely assured that the full complement of existing workers will be retained come what may? These are vital considerations. We need confirmation of the Minister's assurance to the House <Col N="868" /> that this is the best possible deal in the circumstances. We wish it well and hope it has a bright future. There was great optimism prior to the ISPAT saga and tragedy last week. Perhaps there are parallels, but I hope they will not be borne out on this occasion and that this enterprise will have a much longer, brighter, more productive and profitable existence than ISPAT, literally down the road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the staff of the Department for the briefing which they gave me. I particularly thank the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Brendan Tuohy, who made a presentation to our committee. Having listened to the Minister's speech, I realise that the Minister also prepared the statement for the Secretary General, which was very similar to the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is supporting this Bill, which is an enabling measure to allow for the sale of Whitegate and Whiddy to Tosco. The two issues which need to be addressed and are indeed being addressed by the proposal are security of supply for an island nation and stock reserves. The history of the refinery in Whitegate and the company is rather strange. I do not think it has a parallel with any other company or State enterprise in Ireland. It happened more by accident than by Government design. The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Des O'Malley, found that some of the Arab supplying states would not supply oil except on a state to state basis. Even though he would not be a strong advocate of State enterprise, he was obliged to set up a company called the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, in State ownership, which was able to do that trading. That was in 1979. Subsequent to that, the companies which owned the old oil refinery at Whitegate decided to close it down and upgrade their facilities in Britain. The State wisely took ownership of the refinery for quite a high price at the time.</P>
      <P>The refinery has, effectively, limped forward on a non-commercial basis since then with the mandatory regime which requires the distributor companies in Ireland to buy part of their supply from the refinery. That is a requirement in law. There is also a levy on every consumer for every litre of petrol they buy. At present 0.4p of the price goes towards the refinery and its maintenance. It is a relatively small amount but it had to be adjusted on a regular basis, certainly when I was in the Department, because of the volatility of the margins on refining. I remember hoping the margins would be up and we would not have to put up the price by another 0.1p or 0.2p. It was artificially maintained and there was a continuing need for its artificial maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst part was that the refinery was effectively under constant threat of closure from the commercial point of view and the possibility of a new court action. There was always the possibility that another court action would be taken and that the next one against the management regime that was required for its operation would be success<Col N="869" /> ful. This unusual State enterprise came out by virtue of the failure of the private sector, as did nearly all our State enterprises, including CIE, the gas company and so on. In this case, the oil companies decided to close the refinery and the State stepped in for a security of supply reason.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute, as others have done, to the workers and management in the company for their very special devotion to this enterprise in Cork over a long period of time. I am not using the word &ldquo;devotion&rdquo; unadvisedly &ndash; I witnessed devotion to the project which I have not seen anywhere else. Arising from that, the safety and environmental record, as Deputy Jim Higgins and the Minister have said, were unequalled anywhere. The leader of that group for a long time was the chairman of the board, Ed O'Connell. He had a very positive relationship with the people who worked there and he did an excellent job. I do not know what will happen to him now.</P>

      <P>The Tosco Corporation deal gives a 15 year guarantee to this refinery. This time last year it had a one year guarantee and at any other time it would have a one year guarantee. The refinery and the oil terminal will continue to be available to and used for a security of supply point of view for the Irish market. There will be an end to the mandatory regime and the levy, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>The setting up of the European headquarters of Tosco in Dublin is welcome. That will create additional employment and a power base in Dublin which is welcome. The Minister referred to the emergency powers that are still available to the Minister and the taking of other powers that are required. I welcome the advanced stage of negotiations for the workers' ESOP and the security of tenure they will now have which they did not have before. They worked on a year by year basis and could not plan a career in any real sense of the word because at any time a Minister could have ended the mandatory regime. When I was Minister, it was proposed to me. I think civil servants proposed it to every Minister since the time the mandatory regime was brought in.

      <P>&mdash;-the other Department in charge of competition regularly said the mandatory regime and the levy created real problems for competition and should be ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current phase of this started in 1999 post the £70 million investment. There were prior attempts to find a partner or a buyer, but they were not successful. If the deal before the House and the legislation to allow it to be implemented <Col N="870" /> were available when I was in the Department, I would have jumped at them. It is a good deal and is better than the best for which we could have hoped. I say that in all sincerity and I compliment all the people involved in that and in getting that result for Ireland incorporated, the workers in the company and the strategic interest of Ireland from an oil supply point of view.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the 90 day oil reserve. I welcome the retention of our old relation Auntie NORA. It is wise it is retained separately and that it continues to have enhanced powers in the job it does. I urge that we should try to have real reserves rather than ticketing in international markets which is a lot less certain than having the real thing. There is a need to keep a firm eye on the oil companies which have a requirement in Ireland to hold certain reverses for that 90 day period on behalf of NORA. When we had a mini-crisis in the mid-1990s, we found that the oil companies which were supposed to have reserves did not have them and were running out of oil in a matter of three weeks rather than three months. That was caused by a refinery being destroyed in an explosion fire in England, there was a shortage arising from that. We did not have the reserves we thought we had and which the oil companies assured us of. That needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The State unusually gets involved to protect strategic interests or sometimes to pick up the pieces when a private enterprise has failed. However, the wheel has turned full circle in this case and private enterprise is moving back into an area that it is rightly in its interest to be in. In the context of the oil industry, a small stand-alone refinery is practically impossible to operate commercially. Without subsidy, it cannot operate. If we can ensure it operates over a 15 year guaranteed period and with the very good prospects that it can operate well beyond that, we should go for it. That demonstrates the pragmatic position of the Labour Party in regard to State ownership. We support this move and we also supported the Trustee Savings Bank Bill. Due to the timescale of the commercial imperative, I am prepared to support the Bill's early passage through the House. I say that with another hat on, my Whip's hat. Given the safety net amendments the Minister has suggested she will bring in on Committee Stage, I am happy to support the measure.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Aer Lingus: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Jim Higgins on Tuesday, 19 June 2001.</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">recognising the success of the national airline, Aer Lingus, the company's proud <Col N="871" /> record of quality service since the airline was established 65 years ago and the importance of the national airline to an island nation, condemns the Minister for Public Enterprise for:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;her failure to protect or promote the welfare of the company over the past four years;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;her failure to promote a positive industrial relations climate within the company;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;her total confusion and lack of vision as to the airline's role and future;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;her decision to allow the company to be sold by way of a trade sale;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;her failure to ensure that the Aer Lingus workers are made aware of the Government's intentions and calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;abandon immediately any plans to sell off Aer Lingus by way of a trade sale; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;make a clear statement as to what Government plans are for the future of the airline.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy J. Higgins, <i>Mayo</i>).</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann:&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes the Government decision of December 1999 authorising the Minister for Public Enterprise to initiate an initial public offering &ndash; IPO &ndash; of shares in Aer Lingus;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes the Government's decision was heavily influenced by the need to strengthen Aer Lingus' capital base and to position the company to prosper and grow against the background of radical restructuring in the global aviation industry;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes that the company's trading position in 2001 has been severely affected by the impact of industrial unrest and the foot and mouth outbreak and increasingly by external market conditions;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognises that, as a result, it will not be possible to complete the IPO in the near future;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;commends the Minister for Public Enterprise for taking action to address the needs of Aer Lingus in its changing environment by having her advisers examine all sale options, in addition to an IPO, to ensure the company's future going forward and to report back to the Minister for Public Enterprise on their findings; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="872" />&ndash;welcomes the fact that arising from the Minister's recent discussions with unions, agreement has been reached on the resumption of negotiations on the increased shareholding of 9.9% of the company for Aer Lingus employees.</P>

      <P>The substance of my remarks last evening was that Aer Lingus, its staff and all those who have looked after its progress over the years deserve the clarity and support of a Government policy that will assure its future, which can best be done by keeping it in public ownership. I would like to share what remains of my time with Deputies Seán Ryan and Broughan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Private Members' motion on Aer Lingus. I am a very angry Deputy. I am angry at the antics of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, in recent years, particularly in recent months. If the Taoiseach allows this to continue it will have a detrimental effect on the future of our national carrier, Aer Lingus, and its workforce of approximately 6,000 people. I acknowledge that Aer Lingus has experienced trading difficulties this year. The primary reason for these difficulties was the fall-out from foot and mouth disease, which resulted in the cancellation of 70% of bookings on the Atlantic route. Since the foot and mouth disease crisis began, holiday bookings have literally ceased and have not yet restarted. This season will be a disaster as far as the American tourist trade is concerned. The downturn in the aviation industry worldwide has been another factor in trading difficulties for Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made great play of the industrial relations issues at Dublin airport. Obviously I am concerned at any breakdown in industrial relations, especially when the resolution of these disputes necessitates the withdrawal of labour. It is very easy for the Minister to blame the workers, however, it takes two to tango. The frustration that built up in the workforce as a result of low pay has origins in the Cahill plan in 1993 whereby the workforce made major sacrifices to save the company at the expense of the introduction of a low pay regime at the airport. It was always obvious that in the so-called Celtic tiger economy the workforce would not be prepared to continue on this low pay strategy indefinitely. In that regard, it was imperative that the Minister and the board and management of Aer Lingus should have been in a position to acknowledge this problem and enter into meaningful negotiations at the time to reach an agreement with the various workforces and thus prevent the inevitable withdrawal of labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was there in 1993 when the workers were pressurised into making decisions. They made <Col N="873" /> decisions which necessitated them leaving Aer Lingus. They were harassed if they did not vote a particular way. There was blood, sweat and tears. There were resignations from the company from some who did not want to leave. It was a sad experience and one I never wish to see again. The Minister's proposals for a trade sale would be an utter disaster. It would set a confrontational atmosphere at the airport which is in no one's interests, particularly the State and the people.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the industrial relations problems which were highlighted by the Minister in her speech were the least significant of the other factors affecting the profitability of the company. There is a perception, encouraged by the Government, that hundreds of millions of pounds were poured into a black hole called Aer Lingus in north Dublin. Nothing could be further from the truth. In its 60 years, the company received £175 million in 1993 as part of the Cahill plan and £60 million in the previous years. Compare this to the investment made by Governments throughout Europe and it will become clear that we are not at the races.</P>
    <P>I want to put this investment into perspective. The 6,000 employees within Aer Lingus have paid more tax back to the Government in the past five years than the total investment made by Governments since the establishment of the company. I want the Minister to involve the workforce and the unions in trying to ensure the future of Aer Lingus and jobs in it and in this country. We will not achieve this under the proposals emanating from the Minister. I look forward to the comments from Government backbenchers, including my colleagues, Deputy Wright and Senator Glennon, on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Order of Business this morning we had for a brief time a Progressive Democrats majority on the Front Bench when the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, were two of only three Ministers present. It is fair to say that a fairly harsh right-wing ideology has emanated from those two Ministers over the past four years. It shows bitter hostility to the European social model and to workers' rights generally, especially the right to belong to a union, and there is a long-standing determination to wipe out the State enterprise system completely. A key aim of theirs is to leave no strong State enterprise behind when this shaky and discordant Government ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the fiasco of the Eircom sale and the rip-off of hundreds of thousands of Irish families. Below these political figures, we have a flock of circling vultures, several of them Fianna Fáil placed men, who have been stuffed on every available seat on semi-State boards and whose only aim is to hit the jackpot when privatisation occurs. In the past few weeks we have been faced with the farcical attempt to get rid of Aer Lingus in a quick trade sale. This is the culmination of the Minister for Public Enterprise's complete lack <Col N="874" /> of planning, or even thought, with regard to State enterprise, especially our national airline.</P>
    <P>Why did this crazy idea of a trade sale arise at this point? It can only be that this shaky Government knew it could not go for an IPO at present because of general economic problems and the downturn in tourism and travel. Fearful of the imminence of the general election and its certain defeat, the Government hatched the mad trade sale plan to privatise Aer Lingus as quickly as possible and facilitate the privatisation of the whole air travel business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Stagg, I was amazed to hear the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, on early morning radio last week. I was sure it was one of the wonderful actors from &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo; imitating the Minister. I was stunned to realise on Wednesday morning that it was the Minister herself waffling about Martina Hingis's shoes. At that very time she was proposing one of the most serious changes to the Irish economy and, as Deputy Stagg rightly said, a plethora of legislation remains with the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus's possible trade sale prices, as quoted by financial journalists, are laughable. Due to our island status the company has been indelibly linked with the reputation of Ireland since its formation in 1936. On every airport runway in Europe and America the magnificent workforce of Aer Lingus upheld the highest possible images of our nation. Since 1994 the workforce has made great sacrifices in return for Government investment and their own ESOP. The 1999 annual report shows the fundamental soundness of Aer Lingus, with one million passengers on the US routes, passengers on European routes up by 18% and more than two million passengers travelling with the company on the London routes despite fierce competition. It is only one year into Aer Lingus's participation in the One World alliance with distinguished airlines such as American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Iberia to name a few.</P>
    <P>I accept that late last year and early this year there have been difficulties. Cabin staff have moved from SIPTU to IMPACT and there have been a series of stoppages when workers tried to participate in what they rightly perceived was the additional revenues of Aer Lingus. In the past few months there has been a downturn in tourism due to the foot and mouth disease crisis. The company has also been affected by the downturn in the American economy and latterly the difficulties experienced by the chief executive. Despite this, Aer Lingus remains a remarkably sound company. We need a national airline because irrespective of what happens on the investment front, there are major obstacles to allowing our national airline to fall into private hands. Thankfully, as an island nation we have a series of bilaterals with other Governments. A key responsibility of the Government is to protect our national interests. Can we depend on airlines such as Ryanair, which threatened to move to <Col N="875" /> Stansted or Charleroi when the slightest difficulty arose, or on an airline that pursues a hypocritical and vicious anti-union policy? </P>
    <P>There is a bright future for air travel generally. It is projected that passenger numbers will rise by at least 50% over the next decade and new aircraft have come on stream. In that context, Air Lingus should have a bright future, but it needs a Minister and Government that is committed to national economic aims and is not prepared to wipe out a body of achievement in the area of public enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's vision and policy on the airline is clear. It wants to secure the future of the airline as the key carrier to Ireland's main markets in Britain, Europe and the United States. Due to its small size, the nature of the industry and its capital requirements, the best option is for the airline to be privatised. All privatisation options for the airline, which include a trade sale option, are to be examined. The Minister for Public Enterprise has not been panicked into announcing that she will examine a trade sale option for the airline. She would be negligent if she did not examine all possible options for the airline. She has asked her advisers to examine other options for the sale of the airline, to take soundings of interest from potential investors or buyers and to report back to her in a number of weeks. The Minister has apprised the Aer Lingus unions of her intentions regarding the privatisation of the airline and she has reopened discussions on the increased shareholding for Aer Lingus employees.</P>
      <P>During the past four years Aer Lingus has expanded its services. It has opened new routes to Munich, Stockholm, Madrid, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, Cork and Washington. New aircraft has come on stream and further new aircraft is to be delivered in 2003. In addition, the company has become a full member of the One World alliance of airlines. The strategic alliance offers significant benefits for Aer Lingus passengers travelling to and from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that the airline has stumbled from crisis to crisis. Aer Lingus has returned operating profits over the past four years, it has purchased new aircraft and upgraded services. TEAM Aer <Col N="876" /> Lingus was successfully sold to FLS Aerospace. The current trading difficulties of the airline are attributable to industrial relations difficulties in the airline, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and softening economic conditions, particularly on the important US market. Aer Lingus recognised that it had a low pay problem and this is being addressed. Regrettably this has resulted in strikes which have disrupted passengers. The Minister cannot be blamed for the industrial relations difficulties in the airline. The State's industrial relations machinery was available at all times to assist the resolution of the industrial relations difficulties.</P>
    <P>The possibility of British Airways or any other airline purchasing a share of Aer Lingus is pure speculation and premature. No decisions have been made about a trade sale and any sale process would be conducted in an open and transparent manner by the Government. To suggest that the Minister is hawking the airline around the world is a gross insult to our intelligence.</P>
    <P>The question of continuity of senior management in Aer Lingus is a matter for the board of Aer Lingus. The Minister has no function in relation to the appointment of the chief executive of Aer Lingus Group plc. These are matters for the board of Aer Lingus. Casting aspersions on particular board members is not appropriate. Board members are taking on public service obligations for relatively little remuneration and the board of Aer Lingus is to commended on its stewardship of the airline. The board is to be congratulated on the measures put in place last April to stabilise the trading position of the company given the difficult trading circumstances facing the airline. There is no evidence to suggest that management in Aer Lingus is bureaucratic and over-centralised. It is the duty of the management and board of the airline to maximise their resources for the commercial benefit of the business and all stakeholders.</P>
    <P>The valuation of the company depends on its business plan, profitability and market sentiment towards the airline sector. Airline valuations have declined on the capital markets and Aer Lingus is no exception.</P>
    <P>Despite the overall difficulties being experienced by Aer Lingus it is gratifying and reassuring to know that many parts of that company are performing well and are contributing positively to the economy. For example, Aer Lingus employs 200 people in its operation at Cork Airport. That number has grown consistently in line with the phenomenal growth in traffic through Cork Airport in recent years. Passenger traffic has doubled in the past six years and will reach 1.8 million passengers this year despite the difficulties posed by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease earlier in the year. Aer Lingus handles the bulk of that traffic and is consistently striving to improve the service to customers.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Aer Lingus is involved in serious consultation with Aer Rianta at present <Col N="877" /> about the facilities that it requires for the imminent airport expansion project. This will include airbridge access to ensure passengers can board flights without getting wet, as we all do on occasions.</P>
    <P>While that development is awaited, Aer Lingus has not stood still. It has provided three sets of covered steps to protect passengers from the elements. It has made a significant investment in an upgraded gold circle lounge for business passengers, which is a welcome improvement for the growing number of people who fly in and out of Cork Airport daily. Even more significantly, it has doubled capacity on the Amsterdam-Cork route to a twice daily return service, all Heathrow flights are now served by the new airbus fleet which has increased capacity, the Cork-Dublin route benefits from increased capacity and, in conjunction with Aer Arann, there are eight return flights daily between Cork and the capital. Fokker 50 aircraft have been replaced by the BAE 146 four engined whisper-jet and Boeing 737 has been largely replaced by the larger state-of-the-art Airbus 321 and 320.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has invested heavily in the latest computer technology and this will also result in improved customer service. Internet reservations are now available and the involvement of Aer Lingus in the One World alliance, with partners such British Airways, means that a wider range of code-sharing services are available to would-be flyers.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 200 direct employees at Cork Airport, Aer Lingus has approximately 100 air crew based in Cork. This is a welcome development and is an effective boost to the local economy as well as a sensible arrangement whereby staff can live and work in their chosen local area. Further contributions to the Cork economy comes from the purchase of goods and services. It is not insignificant that approximately 20 air crew stay overnight at Cork hotels seven days a week, 365 days a year.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus's investment in Cork, together with the unprecedented investment in airport infrastructure and allied to other public investment in roads such as the Jack Lynch tunnel, is evidence of confidence in the future of its Cork operation. It is not alone in having such confidence because new airline inquiries are coming fast and furious into Cork.</P>
    <P>Overall, despite passing difficulties, the staff of Aer Lingus in Cork are a well motivated group of people dedicated to the highest standards of service. They are committed to the safety, quality and personal service that has been the unique hallmark of generations. The current Aer Lingus staff are living up to our highest expectations and Cork is the best example of this.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has committed, through Aer Rianta, £60 million for the development of Cork Airport. The development has started and machines are on site &ndash; Deputy Noonan was there a few months ago and could not see any machines on site, but they are there now. By the time it is finished and taking inflation into account, the development will be worth £100 million.</P>
      <P>The Great Southern Hotel was opened by the Minister a few weeks ago and I was delighted to be by her side and witness the praise that was heaped on her by the different local sectors, ranging from Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and the chamber of commerce to the various other bodies associated with Cork. The development will involve a new terminal, a new departure area, six airbridges and a new runway extension and alongside that there is the wonderfully constructed e-commerce park which was built in partnership with Aer Rianta, the ICC and private investment. A new director has been appointed to Aer Rianta for the operation in Cork. That was done at the behest of the public representative of Cork who wanted a director for the Cork operation on the board of Aer Rianta. I am delighted the Minister responded positively to that request. I commend the airport manager, Joe O'Connor, and John Smith of Aer Rianta, all the staff of Aer Rianta, the Aer Lingus staff station manager and the helpful Aer Lingus staff in Cork Airport for the excellent service they give.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years the workforce has had to deal with serious situations at the airport and has implemented the Cahill plan through much difficulty and great sacrifice. As a result, large profits were achieved by the management team <Col N="879" /> and workforce in recent years. I believe that despite the difficult circumstances of the past year, the management and workforce of Aer Lingus can bring the company back to profitability and reach the solutions that are required for its future development.</P>
    <P>As the people of Fingal know, Aer Lingus has always been a proud and determined symbol of the State and the forward-looking vision that continues to inspire Irish people. Our location at the edge of the Atlantic and Europe was never seen as a disadvantage so long as the national airline was available to provide a link over miles of ocean.</P>

      <P>The company developed into the jet age under Seán Lemass and wide-bodied aircraft were introduced in the fleet under Jack Lynch. Under the Administrations of Charles Haughey and Deputy Albert Reynolds, the Aer Lingus route network grew to encompass extensive services throughout Europe and America. Under the current Administration and with the implementation of the Cahill plan, the company has moved from the extremely difficult position of the early 1990s to making profits of £60 million in 1999. Aer Lingus flies to six destinations within the United States. Two of these were inaugurated under this Administration.</P>
      <P>There can be no argument that the airline has benefited from the Cahill plan. Agreed and advocated within Europe by a Fianna Fáil-led Government, this plan forced the airline to make the radical adjustments that were necessary to operate an airline in what must be one of the most challenging and changing business environments. The staff of Aer Lingus had to subordinate their ambitions to ensure the ongoing viability of the airline. That is seen in the sacrifices made by many families in the Dublin North constituency and elsewhere to ensure the company survived. As a result they saw the airline re-establish itself, refocus on its core business&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;after the former party leader's promises in 1992. However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
      <P>The Government's objective in selling the airline was to provide the airline with a capital base to grow and expand within a worldwide aviation industry that is extremely volatile and unpredictable. It is well known that virtually £300 million is required for reinvestment in the company. That capital funding must be found and it is incumbent on all Members to support the Minister in ensuring that all options are on the table to secure the best interests of the company. We must ensure the capital funding is made available.</P>
      <P>Proof of the volatility in the market can be seen in the formation of the One World alliance, in which Aer Lingus joined with British Airways, Quantas and other prominent world airlines to find security and prosperity in integrated services and support. A year before Aer Lingus joined this alliance, the largest global airline alliance, Opposition Members believed that nobody would be interested in Aer Lingus, that it was too late and that an alliance would not be secured, but they have been proven wrong.</P>
      <P>Circumstances have not been favourable for the national airline in the past few months. After years of patience and restraint under the strict regime of the Cahill plan, some employees have demanded that their needs should become the focus for the airline. Unfortunately, this led to industrial action in an era which is now intolerant of such activity. It has created a crisis of confidence for the airline among its customers as to whether its services are reliable. No airline, regardless of how large or prosperous it is, can afford such a crisis in today's demanding environment.</P>
      <P>Among the circumstances which have led to the difficulties that exist is that this House unanimously asked people not to travel abroad during the foot and mouth disease crisis. That request was made in the national interest. Other factors such as the cost of fuel, industrial unrest and the costs incurred to overcome that unrest have caused great difficulties for the company.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister is right to ensure that all options for sale are fully discussed&mdash;</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister on the forthright manner in which she outlined the position last night. It is right that the cards are put on the table and that we examine the facts. There is no merit in pretending there are no problems or in refusing to face up to reality. It is even less helpful to pretend that the company is in terminal decline, as some have sought to do, or that a magic wand of State intervention can be waved as a type of cure all for the current difficulties.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is an excellent brand name. On balance, it is a good company which has served the country well. It has a first class workforce which takes pride in the company and in their work. It has a wonderful record of customer service &ndash; customer service tends to be synonymous with the brand. The company is fully capable of providing a world class service in terms of quality and competitive price. Ultimately that will be required of the company in the long-term. However, it is a small airline in international terms and is in urgent need of investment and, perhaps, outside expertise.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to mention the difficulties in the Irish airline general employees' superannuation scheme which were outlined to Members by the Retired Aviation Staff Association. Their demands, which were initially quite wide, have been modified considerably. I consider them to be just demands and they must be addressed. The current difficulties in Aer Lingus cannot be used as an excuse for not dealing with obligations to former employees. It is well to remember that many of these people became former employees or retired during the Cahill plan era when 1,200 of the workforce left their employment. This must be faced up to regardless of difficulties which might be encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> The airline business is notoriously cyclical and many Members will have been surprised and even shocked by the April figures released by the Association of European Airlines which are both sobering and worrying. It is the first year-on-year decline in passenger volumes since autumn 1991 for all the major European airlines combined. Those figures incorporate a 4% decline on the north Atlantic route. The Minister is quite right to take account of these figures. Everybody is aware of the difficulties which arose because of the foot and mouth crisis and, as previous speakers have said, people were being urged not to travel. It was inevitable there would be a greater effect on Aer Lingus than on any other airline. It would be very foolish to take the view that that is likely to continue. We can have a deal of confidence that when that difficult period has been put in the background, there will be an improvement in the figures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the unions have re-entered negotiations in relation to the additional 9.9% of worker shareholding which they were negotiating up to the middle of last year. They already hold 5% in the company and I believe it is encouraging that they are talking to the Minister about an increase.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the urgent need for fleet replacement and the balance between aircraft owned and leased must be altered. We must also face the fact that all the major European airlines, some of which are huge in comparison to Aer Lingus, have sought private capital in their own countries and elsewhere and it is inevitable, and perhaps desirable and necessary, that Aer Lingus goes down the same route.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister indicate very strongly that she will ensure that whatever option is taken at the end of the day &ndash; all options are being examined &ndash; the airline will continue to comply with EU licensing regulations. I understand this requires that it be owned directly by an EU state or by nationals in the state. In order to continue to have rights within the EU the airline will have to comply with these requirements. For those of us who live in the Shannon region it is equally important that the requirements of the bilateral air service agreements be met in terms of the airline being substantially owned and effectively controlled in the country. The bilateral agreements which have been exercising the minds of many people in my area have not been examined in great detail and it is not entirely clear what is meant by that requirement.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister indicating last night that the intention is that the airline will continue to comply with the requirements and that whatever clarification is needed will be sought in advance of any decisions being made. On foot of the Minister's speech last night and what she has told me in conversations over the past several months I am confident she is on course to ensure the future viability of Aer Lingus and the company's workforce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past eight years or so Aer Lingus has had a very successful run of business and I wish to avail of the opportunity to put on record our appreciation to the board, management and staff of Aer Lingus for restructuring the company. In common with most other international airlines it is now apparent that there is an international business fall-off which is affecting long haul and business travel in a significant way. An international slump in business travel is predicted. It is expected that next year will be one of the toughest years since the Gulf War, and experts are predicting it is time to fasten the seatbelts and prepare for a fairly bumpy time. It is hard to expect Aer Lingus to avoid the effects of this.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Swissair announced it is shedding a fairly major part of its business. Currently it has debts of $3 billion and is trying to concentrate on its core business to avoid a collapse of the company. Two French companies went into bankruptcy this week. Sabena and TWA, two very strong international airlines, have scrapped plans this year for putting a new fleet in place. There is a big battle at present for control of Air New Zealand, with Singapore Airlines, Qantas and others in competition for the airline which is suffering very severe difficulties.</P>
      <P>In such an environment it is understandable that Aer Lingus is having difficulties. Part of its problem is that the planned expansion anticipated this year did not materialise. In an effort to bring up the numbers travelling they reduced fares but I do not believe that strategy will now work. The business Aer Lingus is anticipating this summer will level off. The strong US dollar has affected business between here and the west, and the main concentration must now be on consolidating its business and endeavouring to concentrate on next year. It is obvious there will be a necessity to take some remedial action to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>In my view, and in the view of most commentators, the basic structure of Aer Lingus is sound. It will probably have to tighten up in terms of operating costs and it needs some funding, which it has always identified as necessary, to ensure its fleet expansion. Given that there will be some difficulties in the business for some time, it is important we keep in constant touch with developments in Aer Lingus and endeavour to support the airline in so far as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing can be more damaging to the future of the airline than negative comment and the kind of tabloid headlines we have seen about the future of the airline over the past few weeks. The one thing the airline does not need at this time is that sort of negative comment. The management requires that we in particular, as Members of the Oireachtas, give them our backing and the confidence to face the challenging times ahead, recognising they will have difficulties but that they have had very good years. It should be possible to find an opportune way to support the airline in this difficult period. The basic structure of the <Col N="884" /> airline is sound. It may need to carry out some reorganisation, but I am confident the current difficulties in the airline can be overcome and that we will soon have Aer Lingus back to its full strength.</P>
    <P>How does one deal with the problems in international business if travel numbers are in decline? The indications are that this decline is regarded as temporary. This week at the Paris air show, Airbus Europe received one of the biggest orders ever, worth over £6 billion, for the provision of new aircraft. The order books for new aircraft at Airbus Europe are at record levels. The people manufacturing and leasing aircraft are confident that while there are difficulties in the aviation business, they are temporary and the long-term prospects for international aviation and travel are sound. That is borne out by the fact that manufacturers who make the aeroplanes, such as Airbus Europe and Boeing, have full order books, are expanding their services and are providing more aeroplanes. The large international leasing companies are placing orders such as that placed yesterday for 111 new aircraft. This shows that in the long-term the international aviation business will thrive and develop. There is a temporary situation which needs to be addressed and I am sure that the Minister and the Government, in their wisdom, will ensure that the temporary difficulties of Aer Lingus will be overcome and the long-term viability of the company will be secured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Cosgrave, Ring, Crawford, Sheehan, Sargent, Ó Caoláin and Higgins.</P>
      <P>I am please to have the opportunity to speak in support of the motion put forward by my party colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins. We must admit that there is a problem in Aer Lingus but it would be wrong for the Minister to react in panic, saying that she has tried everything else and now we should put the company up for sale to the highest bidder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must return to basics and look at why we have a national carrier in the first place. Ireland is the only nation in the European Union which depends on access by air and sea. Therefore we have a unique interest in maintaining a national carrier and in ensuring that air access is not threatened in any way. That is a important strategic interest which overrides much of what has been said here tonight. Our trade links depend to a large extent on maintaining these connections. The tourism industry depends on there being access to our country from abroad. The so-called Celtic tiger economy depends on executives and others being able to travel quickly, conveniently and safely between Ireland and the United States, other countries in Europe and countries around the world. If Aer Lingus is to be sold off and then possibly broken up, the likelihood is that it would disappear, we would be totally dependent on other airlines to service Ireland and we might actually end up setting up a national carrier again in order that the economy would survive. There<Col N="885" /> fore, let us go back to basics and be terribly carefully about what we are doing. There is a great deal at stake here. The argument that there is a strategic interest must be made.</P>
    <P>We have seen what happened, for instance, when the railways were privatised in Britain. Now even the Tories are saying it was not a good idea. We have seen what happened in California when the electricity sector was totally deregulated; that has not worked out well.</P>
    <P>What we need to know now is where lies the future for Aer Lingus and what kind of package can be put together to ensure its survival as an entity. This is not the time to flog Aer Lingus to the first company which offers to buy it. We must be very careful and hasten slowly.</P>
    <P>I note that in the past number of years, particularly since 1998, the Government has been searching for a strategic partner and looking into the possibility of an IPO, and now it is talking about getting rid of it. The impression one gets from this Minister is of a child who gets a new toy, plays with it for a while and when it gets broken wants to dump it.</P>
    <P>The foot and mouth disease crisis definitely affected Aer Lingus and all airlines operating in Ireland. The downturn in the economy of the United States is also certainly affecting the company and the industrial disputes have not helped either, but I would suggest that this is a time to stand back and take stock.</P>
    <P>I note for instance that, due to the way we in the Oireachtas conduct our business, we have not be able to invite Aer Lingus before the Oireachtas committee to examine the issues at that level. The committees have not been given the resources by the Government and therefore we are totally dependent on the civil servants. The civil servants are doing their best but, with all due respect, when a political decision must be made the resources should be made available to the politicians in order to help them make those decisions. All along, the committees have not been able to do their work because two Oireachtas inquiries have sucked up all the resources and this is not good enough. This House has an obligation and a duty to oversee the work of Ministers, Departments and semi-State companies such as Aer Lingus. If we are not being provided with the resources to do that, then we cannot do our work properly. Hence we are left with the mess we see before us.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus joined the Oneworld alliance about a year ago. I would contend that that development should be given a chance to work and expand. It is too soon to discard it. We should expand that alliance, which has already proved successful for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I fear for what will happen if we go down the road suggested by the Minister. She is cute the way she has put out the suggestion of a trade sale. She has decided to throw it out for discussion and eventually, unlike a rolling stone, it will gather moss. Eventually people will begin to accept that it is a good idea and before we know where we <Col N="886" /> are, the company will be sold. I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    <P>There are other issues concerning Aer Lingus and many colleagues on both sides of the House alluded to these in this debate. If one travels to any airport in the world, one will come across the Aer Lingus logo. Aer Lingus has been a great ambassador for Ireland over the years. It has also been a very safe airline and that is one of the things foremost in my mind any time I get on an aeroplane. I know that it is safe to travel with Aer Lingus because it has a great safety record. The Aer Lingus cabin crew and ground staff act as fantastic ambassadors for Ireland the way they welcome tourists, business people and others and the Aer Lingus logo must have been a welcome sight for Irish people travelling abroad down the years.</P>
    <P>I would say this to the Minister and the Government, let us bear in mind what has happened in the past but let us look to the future with confidence and not panic. It is not time to sell or privatise Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Jim Higgins on tabling the motion at this time. This once great symbol of the State is now reduced to a company where fear is the common factor among the workforce. A staff who made many sacrifices now find that their future is uncertain due to the decision of the Minister for Public Enterprise to take the airline to the bargain basement sales. Abandoning the option of flotation for a sale to a trade purchaser is not in the interest of the airline, its staff, the shareholders or the Irish people. The Minister has nothing to offer. She has not ensured the protection of the national carrier at any point during her four years as Minister.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has played an important part in the perception of the nation by the Irish people. It truly was the flag carrier, setting a standard image of Ireland for the people. When times were hard for the company, the staff were prepared to make sacrifices, take controlled wage increases and look at how changes in practices could restore the fortunes of the company, and now their Minister wants to flog them in a little trade deal.</P>
      <P>The Minister has ruled negatively over a climate of poor industrial relations. The staff are unhappy and believe they are exploited and their welfare is exposed. They can no longer see a clean path for the airline. Uncertainty about to the company's destination has led to confusion among the employees about the security of their jobs. That poor level of industrial relations is now having a negative impact on the workforce and on the public perception of the airline itself. This is because the Minister has failed this company.</P>
      <P>The Government must take control and make amends for this mishandling of the situation. The Government must be resolute in stating that no trade sale of Aer Lingus will be allowed. It must set out and chart the future direction and goals of this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> Uncertainty currently exists for the 5,000 or so employees who reside throughout north county Dublin. They are genuinely concerned about their employment, fearful that in a trade sale they will be demoted to second class, employment will be slashed and their jobs will be put at risk. The staff want assurances that they will be able to put bread on the table, that there will be money to meet the mortgage repayments and that they have a long-term future with a quality employer. These people have made sacrifices. They do not now wish to become the sacrifice of the incompetence of this bad and poorly performing Minister.</P>
    <P>A large number of those involved in building this company are now pensioners of it and they, too, fear for their future. They have to put bread on the table. They worked long hours and sacrificed their families in building up the national carrier. They fear their income and security will be damaged by any sell-off. They want this Minister to ensure they are protected, no matter what happens to the airline in the future. They campaigned, for four years, for proper pension rights and have still not obtained them. Those people must be looked after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Higgins for tabling this very important motion. There have been very serious developments in Aer Lingus over recent months at board, company and national level. People are concerned.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus, RTE, the GAA and Guinness are trade names associated with our success. They have always portrayed a positive image of this country. I am not afraid to be Irish and have always been proud of Aer Lingus. We used to call a neighbour of mine Aer Lingus because every time a plane passed over the west &ndash; and many planes passed over bringing our emigrants abroad &ndash; he would say to a child passing, &ldquo;look up, it's Aer Lingus&rdquo;. It did not matter what plane was flying over.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed with Aer Lingus. Knock Airport was let down badly by Aer Lingus when it needed support. It was mean and greedy. Aer Lingus has, in the past, been subsidised by the taxpayer. People living in Mayo and Connaught pay taxes. Aer Lingus should have given us some support when we needed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like to see Aer Lingus turning out like many of the other carriers which operate here. A constituent of mine brought a case to my attention about two weeks ago. He and his wife were to travel to England and had purchased tickets from Ryanair. On the morning they were due to travel, the woman had a stroke and was unable to travel. Both of these people are in receipt of social welfare payments. The woman has recovered sufficiently to be able to travel to see her family in England but Ryanair will not replace the original ticket. That is unfair treatment. We must have competition. We must retain Aer Lingus. I do not think Aer Lingus operates in that <Col N="888" /> way. I have always found Aer Lingus to be fair, decent and honest.</P>
    <P>I am an auctioneer and I know there is a time to sell and a time to buy. Now is not the time to sell Aer Lingus, but to invest in the company. Now is the time for the airport, the board and everyone involved to put their heads together to ensure the company becomes more successful. Sometimes those involved in running Aer Lingus forget about their customers. We witnessed one and two day strikes at Christmas time. Who were they hurting then? They were not hurting the Government or the unions, they were hurting their customers. That is why figures have dropped. People have lost faith in Aer Lingus. People were hurt and disturbed by their actions. They cannot depend on a company which operates in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the Government and everybody involved in Aer Lingus should get their act together. We all want to be proud of Aer Lingus and wish to see it go from strength to strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for the opportunity he has given this House to discuss this very important issue.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has had a proud and good record for providing a quality service since its foundation 65 years ago. It is of paramount importance that we do not put our heads in the sand and say there is no need for change. We have all seen the figures and know of the difficulties currently facing Aer Lingus. One has to question the turnover of senior management under its current chairman and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. That turnover has been extremely frightening in recent times.</P>
      <P>The staff relations issue has caused major problems and has not enhanced the situation at Aer Lingus. There may be a need for staff restructuring. Some would tell us that staffing levels at Aer Lingus, compared with some of its competitors, is too high. Whatever restructuring takes place, those working in the company deserve proper pay.</P>
      <P>My main worry lies in the obvious difference of opinion between the Taoiseach and the Minister concerned. It is fairly obvious from the Minister's comments that she favours a trade sale. The Taoiseach appears to favour flotation. Neither is in the best interest of Aer Lingus or this country. Competition is important. Ryanair and others have helped to reduce prices for travellers, be they business or tourists. Getting some short-term gain from the sale of Aer Lingus will not guarantee a quality service for our people. We are an island nation. We have to have a top quality air service if we are to remain as one of the more prosperous countries in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in Canada on business last year. I will not forget what happened in Toronto Airport where Air Canada operates a monopoly. An aircraft had to be taken out of service as a result of technical problems. Passengers were put up in a very poor quality hotel for 24 hours with no information as <Col N="889" /> to what was happening. Nobody could have cared less about them. It is a clear example of monopoly. We have witnessed companies being forced into situations where the banks become the bosses. People in the farming community have witnessed the take-overs of PLCs. Well run co-ops, maintained through their board members and shareholders, had to go down the road of public flotation. We know what that has meant to the workers and farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>We should ensure we do not make any mistakes with this company. It is one of our greatest assets. Tourist and business people enjoy flying with Aer Lingus. The staff are the most courteous which I or any other traveller have come across. We need to restructure the company. We need to offer it financial support but we need to do so in a meaningful and proper manner. We should not put it up for a quick sale.</P>

      <P>I dtosach báire ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le Fine Gael as a gcuid ama a roinnt and say we will be supporting the motion and the Labour party amendment. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, supports the development of Aer Lingus as a national carrier in State ownership and we will resist the ham-fisted tactics by the Minister or anyone else to sell off the company. I had a parliamentary question disallowed which asked the Minister if she will confirm that any form of privatisation of Aer Lingus will not proceed in advance of the next general election. I and my constituents want an answer to that question tonight. Go pearsanta táim an-bhródúil as Aer Lingus, mar Ghael. Is beag comhlacht a léiríonn cothrom na féinne maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge agus tugann Aer Lingus tosaíocht do chomhlachtaí eile agus don phobal i gcoitinne. </P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has greatly benefited this country through the returns it has made to the Exchequer from its profits and in north Dublin by sustaining thousands of families and local communities, many of whose members work at Dublin Airport. Loyalty and pride in the company are very high but morale is severely undermined by the Minister's prediction of future losses while at the same time advising AIB and Citygroup to find a buyer for this flagship State company over the next month.</P>
      <P>Loyalty has been greatest among the members of the Retired Aviation Staff Association who, as public sector workers, have seen their pensions fall by over 25% since 1989 relative to other public sector groups. One pensioner I know has been left with £70 per month from his time working for Aer Lingus. After 16 months of hollow expressions of concern the Minister has today verbally undertaken to get justice for the RASI through the Minister for Finance. We know from documents disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act that she has failed the pensioners to date and has not been demanding justice for the retired workers of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the workers, pensioners and management can trust the Minister's integrity and ability <Col N="890" /> the company will not prosper. For this reason she needs to renew her efforts on behalf of Aer Lingus and her trust in and respect for the company, which forms a vital part of the country's economic infrastructure. Aer Lingus needs a good Minister and good management, not threats and a sell-off. It does not need absentee landlords calling the shots in this country's commercial and social life, as was the case in colonial times.</P>

      <P>My time is short and my message is brief and blunt. It is very simply, hands off Aer Lingus. I deplore the mismanagement of the national airline by the Government and I vehemently oppose any proposal to privatise the company in any way.</P>
      <P>It is a scandal that the Government and its predecessors could even contemplate opening the doors to the international corporate vultures who cannot wait to get their claws on this national asset. This is a strategic company, one that has the loyalty of Irish people at home and abroad. It has been built up by successive generations of Irish taxpayers into one of the flagships of the Irish economy and it is one of the most respected airlines in the world.</P>
      <P>I support the main thrust of the Fine Gael Party motion but I wish it had gone further. The fire sale of Aer Lingus to the highest bidder, which now seems to be on the Government agenda, is unacceptable. The privatisation by initial public offering is equally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I wish to record my support for the amendment tabled by the Labour Party Members. The shambles of the Eircom privatisation and the questions arising in the Moriarty tribunal about the Esat Digifone mobile phone licence show where this Thatcherite agenda has led us. The Esat Digifone franchise was sold by the Government for the pathetic sum of £15 million. The company was sold on for £2 billion, making a personal fortune of approximately £250 million for Mr. Denis O'Brien.</P>
      <P>No doubt others are lining up to make similar killings with the privatisation of the national airline. Is this how the Government wishes to extinguish the proud name of Aer Lingus? Let it not be forgotten that successive Governments have tied the hands of this democracy by agreeing to EU competition rules which prevent us from aiding Aer Lingus with State funds if we so decide. Stealing someone's property and selling it back to them is simple extortion. That is what the privatisation of Aer Lingus by public sale would amount to and it must be stopped.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Of all the outrageous privatisations undertaken or proposed by this Government, the proposal to privatise Aer Lingus is among the most reprehensible. This Coalition Government, comprising Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, is saturated with the philosophy of privatisation which is at the heart of EU policy. It is driven not by the well being of working people in the corporations pro<Col N="891" /> posed to be privatised nor by the well being of the consumer and the ordinary people, but solely by the drive for more profit and the greed of the major multinnational corporations which dominate the EU. They are organised at the European round table and they have essentially dictated policy to the EU.</P>
      <P>The Government is in hock to big business and despite the rip-off surrounding the granting of the second mobile phone licence to private individuals, it is proposed to proceed with this sale in a similar manner. Private individuals were favoured during the granting of the second mobile phone licence and cronies of the Government were given a massively valuable asset to speculate with, to sell to multinational corporations and to make a fortune for private individuals. Doubtless it will be shown that, legal or not, there was corruption at the heart of that transaction. The people who benefited demonstrate their patriotism by being tax exiles. They will not even stay in the country to pay their taxes.</P>
      <P>I call on Aer Lingus workers to resist the piracy being planned by the Government on their airline. I also call on the people of north and west Dublin to support the workers in a massive campaign to defeat this proposal by the Government. Aer Lingus should be maintained in public ownership but with significant changes. The management needs to be completely changed. The hacks and cronies of the major Establishment political parties should be unceremoniously ejected from the board to begin the process of reformation. It is incredible that the major political parties continue to fill the boards of semi-State companies with people who have no expertise in the companies concerned and whose only claim to be on them is their cronyism with the parties appointing them. If that is not corruption what is?</P>
      <P>A board representative of the workforce through a genuine democratic process should be put in place. If the workers of Aer Lingus are brought into the heart of the company in a democratic way the company can be transformed by the infusion of those who know best how it could be run most successfully. Representatives of the travelling public and the communities dependent on the airline should also be included.</P>
      <P>I am glad this motion was put down but the Fine Gael opposition was only to the trade sale and not the flotation. The Labour Party opposes flotation but I did not hear any Labour Party representative say that if the party is to be in Government after the next general election it will be a condition of entering Government that Aer Lingus should not be privatised. That type of commitment is required if the party is serious about keeping Aer Lingus in public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said in her speech, she is prepared to work with all interests to ensure the future of Aer Lingus. In <Col N="892" /> this regard I fully endorse her initiative over two weeks ago to appraise the company unions of her intentions concerning privatisation. The discussions on an increases shareholding for Aer Lingus employees are to be resumed tomorrow. The Minister has clearly stated that the way forward is through partnership, especially between the Government, management and unions.</P>
      <P>Many contributors to the debate referred to the company's current difficulties. These difficulties, which have affected the company's performance this year, arise from the impact of the industrial relations unrest, the foot and mouth disease outbreak and, increasingly, from the deteriorating global economic conditions. They are compounded by the company's increased cost base resulting from pay settlements and significantly higher fuel costs this year. As the Minister said, it is also worrying that the major airlines are reporting deteriorating performances for this year as this would appear to signal an emerging downturn in aviation.</P>
      <P>In light of the deteriorating financial position now forecast for 2001, Aer Lingus management and staff must quickly resolve all outstanding industrial relations difficulties, refocus on the needs of the business and address internal issues over which the airline has direct control. This is crucial if the airline is to have the ability to cope with any emerging downturn. There is no ambiguity regarding the Government's policy for Aer Lingus. It has clearly outlined its intentions concerning the future of Aer Lingus and is committed to the privatisation of the airline. That policy takes account of the realities of the global airline market, the size of Aer Lingus and the need to position the company in the market to ensure that it is able to compete effectively in an industry undergoing significant changes.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that she will not allow a crisis similar to the painful crisis that occurred in Aer Lingus in 1993 to develop. It is clear that strong and resolute decisions are required in relation to the future of the airline to ensure that this does not happen. The House would not be forgiving if the necessary measures were not taken now to secure the future of the airline. It is therefore entirely appropriate that the Minister should explore all possible options for the future of the airline, including a trade sale.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the sequence of events which led to her current position. The IPO has been delayed because of the industrial relations unrest and the financial downturn. Against this background, the Minister asked her advisers to look at alternative sale options for the airline, to take soundings of interest from potential investors or buyers and to report back to her within a few weeks. She said that if there is merit in alternative sale options, having regard to the report of the advisers and other relevant issues, a formal sale process will be launched at the appropriate time, which will be open and transparent. It is too early to speculate on the outcome of the advisers' work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> The Government should be commended for not shirking its responsibilities in clearly identifying that Aer Lingus's long-term future is best served by moving the company to the private sector. This is not part of an ideological agenda to privatise State controlled assets. It is based on a clear realisation of what is in the best long-term interests of the airline as a small niche carrier in a very competitive market.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has made, and continues to make, a significant and valuable contribution to Ireland's economic and tourism development by providing a range of quality services to destinations in our main markets in Britain, Europe and the United States of America. It is the Government's wish that the airline should continue to play this role in the future irrespective of its ownership status. The House can be assured that whichever sale option is chosen, or whenever it occurs, the Government will ensure that appropriate arrangements are put in place to protect Aer Lingus's traffic rights to Europe and the United State of America. These mechanisms have been deployed in the privatisation of State controlled airlines in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to reiterate, as she indicated in replies to questions today, that she has taken a keen interest in the concerns of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners about pension increases. She will convey those particular concerns to the Minister for Finance in due course. The Government is clear in its policy for Aer Lingus, which it believes best guarantees the future of the airline. It will pursue this policy in partnership with management and unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this important matter. There is talk of a trade sale of Aer Lingus, but I hope it will not be a discount sale similar to the sale involving Eircom. Many people bought shares in Eircom but that experience may be one of the reasons the Government is considering a trade sale of Aer Lingus instead of a public flotation.</P>
      <P>Ireland is an island nation and it depends the national carrier to promote the country as a major tourism destination. If the airline is sold, given that business is void of sentiment, any new owner will not have the same sentiment with regard to the promotion of Ireland. The caveats in the sale must be considered given that a basement price has been offered for Irish Steel. The figure of £300 million was offered, which is unbelievably low. The fact that the Minister is having discussions on the basis of such a low figure raises questions.</P>
      <P>The Government is getting rid of the State's family silver. This is being done at a time when the economy is booming and taxation receipts are increasing, but what will happen in ten or 15 years? What is the purpose of the sale? The Government is obviously fearful of taking any risks with regard to a major asset, but the sale is very ill-advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> Sligo regional airport started with the help of Aer Lingus some years ago and I thank the company for its support. Air access and equal access are considered fundamental in any region which hopes to be competitive in the future. Currently, both national and international routes are totally incapable of servicing existing passenger and freight requirements in the Sligo area and the Government must consider the development of regional airports.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition, Fianna Fáil promised to support the development of regional airports. Funds have been allocated under the national development plan, but I am doubtful about when the airports will be able to avail of those funds. Only £11 million has been committed under the national development plan to regional airports. This says everything about the level of support for regional airports and their low level of priority.</P>
    <P>Between 13 million and 14 million passengers come into Dublin Airport while Knock International Airport is hopelessly under-utilised. It has the potential to be a highly important element of infrastructure for almost all the BMW region, but the Government has done nothing about it. The plans to improve the highway infrastructure under the national development plan increase the prospect of vastly increased business from the midlands and other areas. The majority of the 13 million passengers come through Dublin Airport. Why has the Government not decided to direct traffic to the west, starting in Shannon and moving up along the west coast? The necessary facilities are available but they are under-utilised.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the current position at Knock International Airport does not provide the basis for further involvement by the taxpayer. However, Aer Lingus may be sold at a give-away price. There is a lack of commitment to regional airports although they have the potential to generate business in areas that have been marginalised in the past, such as Galway, Sligo, Waterford and Donegal. The potential for development and generation of business should be considered.</P>
    <P>Eircom was sold for a very low price, but the people who bought the company did so as an investment. I know from business that such people are answerable to shareholders. They are not answerable to constituents or the taxpayer. It is a different ball game and instead of opting for a quick sale, the Minister should undertake a root and branch examination of the company. Why must the State sell this asset when it is making money? There is no justifiable case for it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the development of regional airports. When in Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party said it would invest in such airports. However, to date, that has not happened. In Sligo, the support promised by the Government has not been forthcoming and I ask the Minister to explain why.</P>
    <Col N="895" />
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fine Gael motion on Aer Lingus. I concur with the question posed by Deputy Perry as to why Aer Lingus needs to be sold. State enterprise has gone out of political fashion rather dramatically over the past four or five years. Just because it is out of political fashion does not mean there should not be any future for a State enterprise which has played a key role in turning this country around. Many decisions to privatise State enterprises throughout the European Union and worldwide have been correct, but there have also been incorrect decisions made. We need a balanced approach to State enterprise and particularly to our national airline, Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, said that Aer Lingus has made and continues to make a significant and valuable contribution to Ireland's economic and tourism development by providing a range of quality services to destinations in our main markets in Britain and elsewhere. We have to reflect very seriously and give maximum consideration to the future of our national carrier. The references to auctions made by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, in recent weeks regarding Aer Lingus have not been very helpful. Any State asset being put through the auction rooms of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who made some disastrous moves in regard to Eircom, would be met with great reluctance by the public. I hope that the Minister of State, his colleagues and wiser counsel will prevail and that the Minister will reflect very seriously before she moves to sell our national airline, and that she would in particular rule out the prospect of a trade sale.</P>
      <P>I support what has been said by Deputy Perry regarding the regional airports and the need to further develop the regions. At this stage Cork is bigger than a regional airport but I think it needs more investment. I look forward to the time when we will have regular transatlantic flights into Cork. We have the facilities and the runway capacity but we need a stronger signal from Government to our national airline that there should be regular transatlantic flights. It would make a difference to the airport and the region. The other aspect of representation as far as Cork is concerned, relates to Aer Rianta more than Aer Lingus. The point has been made time and again that the Cork region needs representation on the board of Aer Rianta. The Minister has made certain moves in that regard but I would like to see more progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the motion and put on record my view that while public enterprise can be considered for privatisation and outside investment, it should not be automatic that we have to privatise every public enterprise. Just because it is the political fashion throughout the European Union does not mean that it is always correct. I hope the Minister moves with caution in regard to Aer Lingus and that she casts aside the question of a trade sale and if she does move down the route of privatisation, that she will do it with more care and attention than was the case when she went to <Col N="896" /> privatise and sell off Eircom. We do not want an Eircom disaster mark two happening to Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> This is a very sad occasion. This debate should not be happening at all. We should be celebrating the success of Aer Lingus and talking it up. We should be buoyant about Aer Lingus rather than, as the Minister has done, talking Aer Lingus into an early grave. This is like saying the obsequies for Aer Lingus. We came in here yesterday evening expecting that the Minister would sketch out some kind of development plan. All we got from her was a list of the trials and tribulations of the company.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate, particularly those from all sides of the House who supported the sentiment of the motion. I thank especially the Deputies on the Opposition side who unanimously supported the thrust of the motion and will vote for it tonight. I thank the Labour Party and Deputy Stagg for agreeing with the motion. We also agree with their amendment and I think that essentially we are singing from the same hymn sheet. They amend the motion to say that we recognise that the strategic role of Aer Lingus can best be guaranteed by the airline remaining in public ownership. As regards the disposal of Aer Lingus by way of either IPO or a trade sale, the first is not on in either the short or long-term, and the second may be on in the long-term provided we get our act together.</P>
      <P>We came in here expecting a positive response, but as Deputy Stagg said last night, all one has to do is look at the performance of this Minister. It has been one hare-brained idea after the other, excellent from the point of view of photo opportunities but hopeless from the point of view of managing her Department. Look at the Eircom debacle which has left 500,000 small shareholders searching their empty pockets and wondering why did they borrow or why did they use their small savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at her performance with regard to the other State utilities. Deputy Stagg referred to the Minister last night as the Molly Malone of the midlands &ndash; cockles and mussels, selling fish at any price, whether it is ESB or the INPC it did not matter as they were all up for sale. The final insult to Aer Lingus must have been her statement that she is prepared and determined to move the company to the private sector. From 1936 to 2001 this company has given 65 years of excellent and proud service to the flying public and to the welfare of this nation. This is an airline that flew the flag for Ireland and put us on the international stage long before the era of mass communications. It is an airline with an unrivalled service ability and one that has won the affection of the travelling public both Irish and international. It is an airline with an unparallelled safety record. It is an airline that made £55 million in 1999 and £60 million in 2000 and then yesterday evening in the midst of her enthusiasm <Col N="897" /> to sell off Aer Lingus, the Minister informs us that she is putting it up for sale. Whether it is a car boot sale or by way of Dutch auction or jumble sale, she is selling it off with about as much emotion as somebody selling a rag doll at a bazaar.</P>
    <P>She told the international predators out there, the vultures, that Aer Lingus is going to record a loss this year. Imagine any Minister selling a product, talking down their own product, but particularly a national utility, saying it is going to make a loss. We are not six months through the year and do not know what the returns are but the Minister is telling the predators in the international community, the vultures and venture capitalists, that the airline that she is putting on the market to sell off to the highest bidder is going to record a loss this year. Could one be more demeaning to an airline which has done this country proud? Yet that has been the attitude of this Minister.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Stagg said last night, this is coming from the republican party, the so-called Nationalist party, the soldiers of destiny who have absolutely no vision or optimism when it comes to the national airline. Airlines go through tough rocky patches, it is a cyclical business with ups and downs, but eventually if the company is strong enough and gets enough encouragement it will <Col N="898" /> come through. The problem is that this Government has not given Aer Lingus the kind of leadership or support it needs; indeed the opposite has been the case. For the past four years there has been a series of industrial relations problems and instead of sorting them out one by one they were allowed to accumulate and in the last nine months the airline was grounded on successive days, each day costing £2 million. Over the past three years alone there have been three chief executives. When the Government should be investing in and resuscitating the airline all it got was negative comment and little by way of a helping hand.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are debating the demise of an airline which is part and parcel of what we are, an airline which is on a par with Guinness in terms of reflecting Irish and Irishness. It is a brand label which has carried the flag throughout the world.</P>
    <P>We will not tolerate what this Minister is proposing. What we are collectively saying is hands off Aer Lingus; it is not for sale. Take down the for sale sign, put your money where your mouth is, refloat the company and let it go forward into the next decade and on into the century with the sort of confidence shown by those who founded it in1936 who had that pioneering spirit. Give Aer Lingus the role it deserves and the role it must have, a unique national carrier in State ownership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the proposed sale of INPC to Tosco Corporation. My real interest which is in Whitegate Oil Refinery goes back to the 1950s when it was built. I did not have any great interest in the refinery in the 1950s but I had an interest in the sweets I received from those working there. That is something I have never forgotton. Down through the years, the refinery met troubled times and finally ended up closing in 1979. Since then, negotiations have taken place between the Government and the owners and in 1982, the Government decided to take over the refinery.</P>
      <P>In February 1982, I was elected to the Dáil and my first function as a TD was to go to the reopening with the then Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds. Since then the refinery has progressed and stayed in operation. In difficult times it provided a good service to the country. However, it has had to put in large investment to keep it up to date in order to meet the environmental standards and requirements imposed and demanded by the public.</P>
      <P>Without the mandatory regime, it would not have been able to survive. The problem facing this Government and others in recent years was the power of the Government to ensure that the mandatory regime would continue in place. With the refinery facing further costs of about £100 million to £200 million by 2005 to meet the Auto Oil II requirements, it was incumbent on the Government to look at all the aspects of the future of the refinery and especially the issue of whether the refinery, out of its own resources, would have been able to finance the refurbishment and upgrading that would be required in future years. The Government wisely took the best decision to ensure the continuation of the refinery so that the employees would be assured of the future of their jobs.</P>
      <P>As the Minister made quite clear in her speech, over the last year detailed negotiations were carried out with many different bodies that were interested and finally a decision was made that Tosco Corporation was the best of those who were interested. Even though people in this part of the country were not aware of Tosco Corporation, it is now clear that this is one of the big players in the United States and will become even more important following the merger with Phillips Petroleum Corporation. It will be moving into Europe for the first time and I believe it sees Ireland as being the ideal stepping stone to moving to this part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has met the considerations that the Government felt were necessary for the sale. The Tosco Corporation is guaranteeing the operation of the refinery and the oil terminal in Whiddy for at least 15 years on a fully commercial basis and that is without the support of the mandatory regime. It has given a further undertaking to maintain existing jobs and conditions of employment. Those are the two main areas that the workers to whom I spoke were concerned about. I take the <Col N="901" /> word of the Minister that this undertaking copperfastens the number of jobs and the conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>It has given a substantial undertaking to continue to operate the refinery and oil terminal for at least 15 years. We have had an example of another organisation in the constituency, which took over a semi-State company five years ago and that company gave an undertaking to operate for five years. Even though this was a different business, they held to the conditions and I believe that this business will continue to operate after the 15 years.</P>
    <P>Security of supply was raised. Some people have asked whether the national oil reserves will be under the control of the National Oil Reserves Agency &ndash; NORA. I am glad the Minister has clarified that the 90-day stocks of oil, in compliance with international obligations, will be maintained under the control of the National Oil Reserves Agency. The Minister has confirmed that NORA is not part of the transaction and will continue to operate in the state sector. It is very important that the national strategic stocks will still be under Government control.</P>
    <P>The mandatory regime will be abolished and INPC and the State will not be faced with the burden of future investment requirements beginning with Auto Oil II in 2005. As I said earlier, this is a vital element of the decision the Government has made. It would have been an unbearable burden on the State and on INPC to find the finance to fund the upgrading necessary to comply with Auto Oil II.</P>
    <P>An ESOP is being set up and this will be very beneficial to the workforce. From speaking with them I know they are delighted with the approach the Minister is taking on that. Pensioners and current employees raised concern about the pension fund. They wanted confirmation that the pension funds would be guaranteed into the future. From our committee meeting last week as well as the legislation that is in place, I know that the pension funds of the refinery workers come under the current legislation. They have no need to worry about their pensions.</P>
    <P>At our committee meeting last week, I raised the issue of the land. Unfortunately, I did not get a reply as a vote was called. There are approximately 140 acres of land not being utilised by the refinery. Many farmers in the area have been asking if the State could sell some of it to local farmers. Will the Minister comment on that in her reply? Although I would prefer the refinery to be maintained in the control of INPC, we have to look at the facts and judge how future events will develop. In that context, the decision taken by the Minister is the correct one and, in the years to come, we will still have a refinery in Whitegate, with the standards of safety, health and community participation which have operated over the past 30 years. The refinery has been a welcome feature in the East Cork area and if, as we <Col N="902" /> hope, it is maintained by the new management, I have no doubt it will retain that esteem in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on introducing this legislation to the Dáil and bringing it forward before the end of this session. I hope all potential loopholes in the Bill are fully explored.</P>
      <P>The Minister's comments in recommending the Bill to the House highlighted a number of fundamental issues which the Government does not always prioritise.</P>
      <P>I know the INPC company has carefully studied proposals from many companies for the take-over of its business. There are excellent people at the helm of INPC, with their feet firmly on the ground and their hearts in the company and in the localities of Cork and Bantry in which they operate. They have worked against the odds to turn the Bantry terminal and Whitegate refinery into good viable companies that attracted strong interest from prospective buyers. I trust their judgment in recommending the TOSCO oil company to the Department. I know the Minister and her officials meticulously studied this deal and vigorously negotiated it. I have met the TOSCO management and I am of the opinion that they are capable and honest people with serious plans for the Whiddy terminal and Whitegate refinery.</P>
      <P>In recommending this Bill to the Dail, can the Minister assure the workers of the long-term security of their jobs? None of us, on any side of the House, should promote the sale of State assets unless we are satisfied the future is secure and it will blossom to the further benefit of the workers and the State. I represent one to the most beautiful parts of Ireland, where there is the perfect mixed economy of farming, fishing, industry and tourism. The revival of the oil industry in Bantry Bay brings with it hope and anxiety. The Minister, her Department and all of us in this House must ensure that the oil industry will be a good neighbour to all the other native sources of income in that area.</P>
      <P>In Bantry Bay, we have the second largest fishing port in lreland, Castletownbere, which is the country's largest white fish landing port. We have a mariculture and aquaculture industry which is second to none. It provides local employment for almost 500 people, directly and indirectly. The people of that area must be assured that their livelihoods will not be endangered by this new deal. Our very progressive fish farming industry must feel secure. We have a wonderful tourist business based on the beauty of the area and the warmth of its people. All these major contributors to the well-being of our community must be assured that every effort is made to ensure the oil industry is managed and monitored to the highest standards and that, far from being a threat to their business, it will instead bring benefit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister visited Bantry Bay a few years ago and experienced, at first hand, the difficulty of getting in and out of Whiddy Island, where the oil terminal is located. Bantry does not have the <Col N="903" /> facilities to manage and monitor the regular movement of very large tankers and all the harbour craft and tugs that will be required to support such movement of oil. To paraphrase one of the Minister's colleagues, the Government has &ldquo;floods of money&rdquo; and this deal will add to the wealth of the Exchequer. I urge the Government to pay attention to the fundamental needs of the people of West Cork when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is counting out yet more money in his next budget later this year.</P>
    <P>Under the leadership of Dr. Garret FitzGerald as Taoiseach, my party scheduled a budget of £16 million for infrastructure needs around the Bantry Bay area. This was on foot of the receipt of £46 million by the Government at that time from Chevron Oil, who decided to pull out of Bantry bay in 1985. Fianna Fáil, on returning to Government in 1987, immediately pulled back more than half this money and used a portion to pave Grafton Street instead of improving the facilities in Bantry and the Bantry Bay area. I hope this time the Government will leave the paving of Dublin streets to those who amassed wealth from the Celtic tiger and who seem to be exclusively resident in the Dublin area. I urge the Minister to be considerate of the needs of Bantry Bay and West Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should step down from his high horse on the plains of Kildare and try stepping into a boat in Bantry Bay. He would then see how difficult it is to operate that mode of transport in a Bay that is bereft of basic safe facilities for the movement of people and craft. Our Taoiseach is no stranger to Bantry, where he is proud to speak of his maternal relatives. I hope he will remind his Minister for Finance to be suitably considerate of the people of that area in the Government's forthcoming financial provisions. Proper infrastructure is of paramount importance for the survival of industry in the Bantry Bay area. Proper infrastructure consists of a proper pier. The day the Minister went out to Whiddy Island she saw the serious neglect of the Bantry Bay area, as evidenced by the lack of a proper pier. Industry will not survive in any part of Ireland without proper infrastructure being in place. Therefore, I urge the Minister when she gets an opportunity to get extra funding, to outline to the Minister for Finance the need for a special allocation in the budget for the advancement of the pier in question. In order to progress, it is essential that she embarks on that course of action. If the infrastructure is not put in place the future of the Whiddy terminals and of Whitegate will not be so rosy.</P>
    <P>It is also of primary importance that indigenous Irish fuel companies, which have a heavy dependence on fuel supplied from the national refinery in Whitegate, are safeguarded. Purchasing fuel from the national refinery enables indigenous Irish fuel companies to acquire products at competitive costs. This fuel can be purchased at rates that enables the smaller Irish fuel companies to <Col N="904" /> compete with the larger oil companies. The smaller Irish fuel companies which include Tedcastles, Maxol, Emo, Morris, Campus, Estuary and Staffords currently hold 26% of the national market share. The share held by Irish oil companies is higher in rural Ireland. For example, Top Oil holds an 8% market share nationally but this company has a much larger share in the Munster region.</P>
    <P>Competition provided by Irish fuel companies results in lower fuel prices for consumers in the areas they service. They provide alternative fuel supplies to a range of consumers for their motoring, home heating, agricultural and commercial requirements. In areas in which Irish oil companies compete with the major oil companies, they have a lower price for consumers. A recent AA survey highlighted that cheaper fuel prices and competition applies in areas where Irish companies are present. Competition is the life blood of trade as far as any industry is concerned. I urge the Minister to make sure in the regulations she is inserting into this deal with Tosco that those companies will be borne in mind and that they will not be prohibited, maybe in a few years time, from supplying much needed fuel to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of Whitegate to the Irish economy and the consequences of allowing a large multinational company operate it as a private monopoly, it is imperative that the legislation contains some control on the purchaser of the refinery and a mechanism to oblige the purchasers to honour the commitments they seem to have given the State in private negotiations.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the legislation should oblige the new owners to make supply available to the State at the current market prices, to offer the fuel to customers on a non-discriminatory basis and to produce a sufficient range of products to meet strategic fuel needs at a given time. The deal should adhere to a defined arbitration procedure for the settlement of disputes with customers. It should spell out and honour the commitments given to the State as part of the private negotiations between INCP and the new owners. The refinery should operate in a way that recognises the critical role of the refinery in the economic and commercial well-being of the State for as long as the refinery remains the only refinery within the State. Access should be granted to refinery facilities for third parties on a national discriminatory basis in so far as the facilities are not needed for the purchasers activities at any time for as long as the refinery remains the only refinery in the State.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, this Bill does not contain one such provision. The State is relying entirely on the purchaser of the refinery to place considerations that are important to Ireland ahead of commercial issues affecting a global company operating in a volatile environment and driven largely by shareholder concerns. Surely, the national interest and strategic considerations require statutory protection rather than mere <Col N="905" /> promises advanced in the course of commercial discussion.</P>
    <P>We saw what happened in Bantry Bay when Gulf Oil was introduced almost 40 years ago. Gulf Oil got the use of one of the finest bays in western Europe, Bantry Bay, which at one time Great Britain boasted could hold its entire fleet. The use of that bay was handed over by the Government to Gulf Oil without a shilling of compensation. No revenue accrued from the millions or billions of tonnes of crude oil landed at that storage depot in the Whiddy tanks. I guarantee the Minister that if a proper deal had been made at that time not only would west Cork be rolling in riches today, but the country would be rolling in riches as well. Proper legislation passed by this House must include proper procedures. I do not want to see a similar situation emerge where the only return Gulf Oil gave to Bantry Bay was a statue of St. Brendan in the square looking out at the bay &ndash; a marble statue which is still there. However, statues do not butter the bread of those concerned.</P>
    <P>I insist that the Minister make available to the House as quickly as possible the full details of the deal concerned so that every paragraph of it can be scrutinised by the Members of this House to ensure we are not again 40 years on giving another gift to an international oil company without conditions and maybe without guarantees. We all know what international conglomerates can do when they get their foot in the door of certain industrial developments. I do not want us to make the mistake that was made with Gulf Oil. While I welcome this deal with open arms, I would be happier if we had the full text of the agreement which could be read to Members of Dáil Éireann. I have met the company officials and feel that they are honest, active and very proficient industrialists with an enormous amount of experience in the industry. But we are handing over a State jewel. INPC in its wisdom and the Government were very mindful of the development that could ensure that single point mooring be put into operation in the bay. For that I say thank you. It was the first step in attracting this giant American conglomerate into the bay.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give an assurance in this House that she will not sign any deal without having perfect knowledge of all aspects of it. I am not doubting the Minister's capacity, I know her to be fit and able to rise to the occasion, but I ask that the same mistake as was made with Gulf Oil is not made again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of Irish National Petroleum Company, the Whitegate Oil Refinery, its future and that of its workers. The Government had to make a decision whether investment would come from the Exchequer or to sell it off to a company willing to invest and develop the refinery. I know that the Government spoke to various parties and was prepared to approve the investment in the programme. However, it was concerned at the costs involved in upgrading the refinery to allow it to continue to function. A decision had to be made and I welcome it. It is a deal which is progressive and one which gives the workers their pension rights and all the other aspects which will be addressed in this issue. More importantly, we will have employment and an oil refinery in Whitegate for the next 15 years.</P>
      <P>I have a small concern which I hope can be addressed. In a national emergency, or in the event of outbreak of war or any problems associated to the supply of petrol to this country, the Minister has stated that she has a provision whereby she can more or less take over the running of the refinery but I am not sure if that is the case. I know Tosco has given commitments to run the refinery and the oil terminal for at least 15 years on a fully commercial basis without the support from the mandatory regime and there is a further undertaking to maintain existing jobs and conditions of employment. That sounds very good in 2001 but I am concerned about the state of the facilities in 2016. Will we have a dilapidated, run-down oil refinery? The company may fulfil its commitments over the 15 years but is there a continuing programme of reinvestment provided for in the agreement? I would be a sad if in 15 years' time we had an oil refinery that is completely out of date, has been ran into the ground and has no investment forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Effectively, we would have storage depots in Whiddy with the ability to store oil for 90 days but no manufacturing facility. I am hopeful that there is something in the contracts &ndash; which will be published when this Bill is passed and the deal signed &ndash; whereby there will be some form of investment to ensure that we have an oil refinery in the event of an emergency. Suppose something happens in 2014. Tosco will have almost completed its term of commitment but if there was a national emergency we could be taking over something that is non-operational or not able to carry out the function we expect of it. I hope the Minister can clarify that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>INPC, as a small stand-alone company, is certainly exposed to the various changes in the international oil markets. Being taken over by a large company does protect it to a certain extent. The mandatory regime will not be in operation for the support of the refinery. We like to look at the free market and ensure that all projects stand alone. However, if we are willing as a nation to fund Whitegate refinery to the mandatory regime, it would be a pity if, in 2008 or 2009, Tosco were to say it could not honour the com<Col N="907" /> mitments made in 2001 or that it found it impossible to operate profitably. We would then have two choices. It could leave and offer compensation or we could introduce a mandatory regime to support the refinery, then at least we would have something when the fifteenth year is up. I raise that because I believe it is important for an island nation to have a certain level of security which allows it to refine its own crude oil. We have the 90 day storage and the area of interconnectors and dependence on gas is all very fine, but refining our own oil is something we should look at in the overall context.</P>
    <P>The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, maintains strategic 90 day stocks in compliance with international obligations. Although currently a subsidiary of INPC, NORA is not included in the transaction and will continue to operate in the State sector. That is very important but, as I pointed out, if there is no refinery to refine the reserves, we are back to square one. It is something I would like the Minister to clarify in her summing up. Tosco has indicated an intention to establish its new European headquarters in Dublin and to invest in Whitegate and Whiddy on a commercial basis. We all welcome that. If, as things change, there is no commercial basis for investment, we will find that there will be no investment forthcoming. It is something I would also like to have clarified. Having spoken with some of the workers, I believe the commitments the Minister has made and the commitments Tosco is willing to enter into in regard to the workers and their entitlements are welcome.</P>
    <P>There is always great concern when we talk of selling off a State asset. The first fear expressed is protection of the rights of the workers. There is concern regarding the ISPAT plant. A good redundancy package was offered to workers on the sale of Irish Steel to ISPAT, but in the event of the closure of ISPAT the workers who stayed on with that private company for those extra five years out of a loyalty to the company or for whatever other reason will not receive the generous redundancy packages that were given by many State companies. I hope all those issues will be tied down in the meat and bone of the small print of the contract. I could draft something similar to this script, the contents of which are welcome, but it is vague. It is important to ensure that the protection of workers' rights, including pension entitlements, is covered in the small print. Such rights have not been protected in some instances, the position of workers in the ISPAT plant being a case in point.</P>
    <P>Another issue of concern is the impact of the implementation of the Seveso directive, which comes under the brief of another Minister. I am not sure whether the oil refinery comes under that directive. The impact of that directive is something of which we should always be aware. It is not the case at present, but in the event of the downgrading or lack of investment in the oil refinery the implementation of that directive <Col N="908" /> would become an issue. The implementation of that directive in regard to Whitegate oil refinery would have a major impact on the stagnation of development in and around the harbour area. I would welcome clarification on those issues. Tosco must be obligated to ensure that at no stage, because of inadequate investment or changes in policies in regard to the oil refinery, the Seveso directive is implemented in its fullest form as it would stagnate development in Whitegate right across the harbour and down as far as Midleton. When drawing up this contract the officials should examine this issue. Tosco should be obliged to ensure the highest safety standards apply at all times over and above what may be required in terms of normal practice in oil refineries and, more importantly, to ensure that the Seveso directive is not implemented in that area.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and her officials on the negotiations. I hope she will take on board my concerns regarding those issues, particularly the latter one, as I am sure the others are obvious and would be considered in any event. I wish the workers concerned years of oil refining and that in year 2016 there will still be a functioning oil refinery in Whitegate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm to the House that there is major welcome in Bantry for the sale of these assets to Tosco and for the introduction of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited Bill to facilitate that sale. The second major point I want to make is that there will be an even bigger welcome in Bantry when half the moneys that were subsequently axed from the £15 million Bantry package, which I negotiated many years ago, are restored from the proceeds of the sale.</P>
      <P>On the question of the sale of these assets to Tosco, I will not focus on the Whitegate refinery &ndash; I am speaking not as a Fine Gael Front Bench spokesperson on this area but as the local Deputy from south-west Cork. My principal focus is the Whiddy oil terminal. It is clear the terminal is the major incentive for Tosco to buy both it and the refinery. This terminal is not replicated in many parts of the world and probably is incapable of replication anywhere else at present. It is interesting that it began its life in the 1960s. I was a young lawyer at the time and I can remember the buzz and activity when it was being built, and I made a few bob out of it. It was developed with the idea of the transhipment of oil from Saudi Arabia and places in that part of the world to Whiddy and then the transhipment back in smaller tankers to Rotterdam and other refineries in Europe. It is now proposed that large tankers will come to Whiddy Island and there will be a transhipment of oil onwards to the west, heading for the east coast of the United States, which would not have waters, harbours or the draught to accommodate the super tankers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tosco's need is Whiddy's opportunity. The reason I particularly welcome this sale on behalf of west Cork, including Bantry, is that the ter<Col N="909" /> minal was built over 30 years ago and the tank farm is in need of massive investment to update it. The INPC does not have the necessary resources to make that massive investment and under EU regulation the Government cannot probably make that investment. I understand from Tosco that it will make that massive investment. I welcome that. My colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, who is present would probably complain that it should be done by the State or by a semi-State body. I would welcome it even more if that massive investment was to be made by the State or a semi-State body, but there is no possibility of that. I am delighted Tosco is about to make that massive investment which is necessary because the huge tanks at the terminal would be virtually derelict unless it is made.</P>
    <P>This is ideal from the point of view of Bantry, other parts of west Cork and workers at the terminal. I have spoken to them and they are very favourable to the proposal. It is also attractive to the other people concerned who will get a good deal of work from the expansion of the activity at the terminal and the work associated with the tankers. The proposals may involve one tanker coming in per week or every few weeks. A great deal of work will be generated for people associated with that and from the redevelopment of the terminal, which will be a major spin-off for Whiddy, Bantry and west Cork generally. I want to see that and to encourage it in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I will not put down a list of restrictive covenants, but I enter one caveat, that the anti-pollution regime should be in place there and strictly enforced. While I want massive investment in this area and this multinational is very welcome into a harbour in my constituency, it must be subject to the most stringent controls that are currently applicable to the INPC and elsewhere. I understand that Tosco is prepared to accept that, but responsibility will rest on the Government to ensure those controls, whether by regulation or through the Bantry Harbour Commission, are in place and, more importantly, are monitored, supervised and enforced. That is very important because there is a major fishing industry and mariculture industry in Bantry and both would be at risk in the event of any major pollution in the bay. That is the first welcome.</P>
    <P>The second welcome is for the balance of the Bantry package. In 1986, INPC became responsible for the management of the terminal. If recollection serves, a deal was made involving a sum of $44 million from Chevron, the owners who had succeeded Gulf Oil, and the transfer of the terminal for the nominal sum of £1. The deal also involved giving up the reinstatement clause with regard to the jetty which had been damaged in the <i>Betelgeuse</i> incident in 1979. A total of $44 million accrued to the State. I immediately demanded moneys for Bantry from that settlement.</P>
    <P>There were hard negotiations involving the then Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, the then <Col N="910" /> Tánaiste and Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, and Liam Kavanagh, the Minister for the Environment. The negotiations were long and complicated. They started by offering me £1 million. Eventually I put together a development package for the Bantry Bay area. The package was ultimately agreed, after tough negotiations, at £15 million, payable over four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>Yes, the £15 million package was launched in Bantry. I set down the major items to be funded each year from the package. The civil servant who assisted me in drawing up the package, Paddy Teahon, now has another role as chairman of Campus Stadium Ireland.</P>

      <P>He was then the assistant secretary in the Department of the Taoiseach and was made available to assist me in drawing up the package. However, that is history.</P>
      <P>The package was put in place and the £3.5 million for the first year was paid. The £3.5 million for the second year was included in the Estimates. I secured a Cabinet decision on this because an election was due and I was not sure we would win. Efforts were made after the election to chop that money but they failed because the measures which Paddy Teahon advised me to put in place ensured the funds were untouchable. The first two years of funding brought huge benefits to the Bantry Bay area.</P>
      <P>The second two years of funding were chopped by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government. There is £8 million due to Bantry from that package. That is a debt of honour.</P>

      <P>I will be relentless in pursuing this issue. This Government will get money again from Whiddy Island. I do not know how much is involved. My only concern is that it is at least £8 million. There is confusion about the figures. There is talk of $100 million less payment of debts and so forth. I understand that complicated negotiations are involved but my only concern, as the west Cork Deputy who negotiated the Bantry package, is that there will be at least £8 million for the State. The first charge on that money is the balance due under the Bantry package. I demand that money on behalf of Bantry and I will continue to demand it until it is paid. That is the mortgage or first charge on the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I talked to a number of people in Bantry who outlined the priorities for funding from that £8 million. My colleague mentioned the need for a new pier. The new pier will be necessary in any case due to the extra activity that will inevitably occur in the bay following the take-over of the <Col N="911" /> terminal by Tosco. There were plans in the past to improve the old pier but that is not possible. A proposed new pier has been designed and is costed at £5.5 million. A sum of £2 million is in place and there is a possibility of raising a further £1 million. That is the first demand on the restored Bantry package. It is a necessary and appropriate development to benefit from the moneys generated by the sale of Whiddy Island. The pier will be needed in any event.</P>
    <P>The Minister should advise her colleague, the Minister for Finance, that I will tackle him about this. My parliamentary question on this issue was transferred to him so I will talk to him about it next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>I want the support of the Minister for Public Enterprise on this issue. This money is due to Bantry. There is a list of other infrastructure development required for the area. A new sewerage scheme is required for Bantry so we should go ahead with it. The water supply is bad, causing water shortages in some parts of the town and outlying areas in the summer. A new ring road is required. These developments will take place in time so the Minister and the Government should face the inevitable. This money is owed to Bantry. The Government chopped it the last time it was due to be paid. More money is coming to the Government now so it should pay that debt of honour.</P>
      <P>That is the main point I wish to make on behalf of west Cork. We will watch this sale carefully. According to the Minister, a short time frame is involved and the sale could be completed next month.</P>

I will want to see the final account but my interest is the bottom line and that there will be more than £8 million to credit thereafter.

      <P>I will let my colleague, Deputy Stanton, discuss the issues relating to Whitegate. He is from the area and will outline matters of concern to him. My concerns are Whiddy, Bantry and west Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on this Bill. I am a little put out that Second, Committee and Report Stages will be taken tomorrow. That is not the best way to do business. It would have been better to have a break between the different Stages to facilitate discussion and reflection on what is said by Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>We are disposing of an important asset. In March 1982, the then Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, said petroleum products are almost as essential to an economy as food is to an individual. He went on to say that it behoved the Government to guard against the risk that supplies of these products could be interrupted for reasons outside its control. He made those comments when the State was obliged to take over the operation of the refinery. Almost ten years later, Deputy Molloy, who was the relevant Minister at that stage, said in an address to the Institute of Petroleum that there was no room for complacency or &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; attitudes in relation to energy supply and security. He said we could not take it for granted and that it was too easy in times of plenty to question the necessity for efforts and arrangements which had the objective of enhancing security of energy supplies.</P>
      <P>In recent years successive Governments and Ministers have recognised the importance of the oil industry to Ireland. We are an island nation. I understand, and the Minister might confirm this, that the supply of refined product in Europe and globally has become rather tight. I understand refineries across the world have closed for various reasons. Therefore, we could be facing a shortage of petroleum product.</P>
      <P>There are a number of issues which are of concern. When the mandatory regime disappears, the larger companies will no longer be compelled to take product from Whitegate. What will happen if they decide not to take product from Whitegate but to import it? I understand that was a problem in the past. Could we see a situation where the new owners would say they have no customers for their product and that production will have to be reduced or the facility &ldquo;moth-balled&rdquo; or closed? What guarantees has the Minister received and how are they copperfastened to ensure the refinery will be kept in operation for 15 years to the required level? If that does not happen, what can the Minister do? I would like answers to these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the committee meeting we had recently with officials from the Department and INPC. However, it was unsatisfactory that we had two breaks during the meeting due to votes in the House. We could have spent longer teasing out <Col N="913" /> the issues. All sides benefited from the meeting, but I felt there was unfinished business and that more could have been done. An old hobby-horse of mine is the need for more resources for committees. They can do very valuable work but they are not being resourced. In the past few months they have not even been able to meet. Perhaps the Minister in her role in Cabinet can do something in this regard. We cannot do our business. It would be very regrettable if there was something in this Bill which Deputies should have scrutinised but missed due to the lack of resources for committees.</P>
    <P>I mentioned what might happen if large companies decided not to take product from Whitegate. However, there are quite a number of small indigenous Irish companies and I know they have been making representations to the Minister and the Department. They are concerned about their future as some of them are almost totally dependent on Whitegate for supply of refined product. We are speculating, but if at some future date the new owners decide not to supply these small companies, will they have any comeback? Will it result in them going out of business? Would we see a reduction in the number of oil companies selling refined product? Would competition decrease and prices increase? I would like the Minister to address these concerns. I have tabled some amendments on Committee Stage so we can discuss these issues further. In her reply to Second Stage I would like the Minister to give some indication of the safeguards for these companies and her reaction to the representations they have made.</P>
    <P>Regarding the deal itself, we have been told it is quite good from the State's point of view. It is also very good from Tosco's point of view. It is getting a state of the art oil refinery which has just benefited from an upgrade costing $100 million. It will be receiving the business debt free as any debts will be taken on by the State. It will have an exclusive contract with the State to store the national oil reserves at Whiddy, which I understand is worth about $8 million or £8 million per annum &ndash; I am not sure which. Tosco will have the highly prized asset at Whiddy terminal. I understand that needs upgrading, but it is unique in Europe if not in the world. The company will also have guarantees and indemnities from the State, and I would like the Minister to elaborate further on these. Will they be totally open-ended and exist forever? Will the State be standing over these guarantees right into the future? Deputy Kelleher mentioned 15 years from now, but could we be talking about 100 years from now? We have put forward amendments on Committee Stage so these issues can be discussed further.</P>
    <P>Tosco is getting the benefit of commercial contracts negotiated by INPC which are quite valuable. It is also getting ownership of 140 acres of prime agricultural land adjoining the Whitegate refinery. This is probably a good thing as it will leave room for expansion, but this was not really <Col N="914" /> made known until Deputy Michael Ahern asked about it at the committee meeting last week. As a number of Deputies have said, we would like to see the small print. Are there other commitments and aspects to the deal which have not yet been disclosed? This is where a properly resourced committee would be beneficial so we could have the time and backup to examine these issues in detail and to assist the Minister. Our job is to challenge, debate and discuss and not to knock things all the time. We should also be constructive and assist the State in going forward. The issue of the land was never mentioned in answers to parliamentary questions which I tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked quite a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked quite a number. The other issue is the Tosco-Phillips changeover and the impact that might have. I understand that Phillips, by acquiring Tosco, has changed its entire way of doing business. Up to then I think Phillips was talking about getting out of the refining industry. In one sense I understand why the legislation is being rushed by the Government and INPC, namely, to get in before the deal goes through, but one wonders why it has to be done now with Tosco and why we cannot wait until this other deal has been bedded down between Tosco and Phillips. There are probably good reasons and I would like to hear them.</P>
      <P>We will also be turning over the INPC headquarters in Dublin. That is a good deal and it is a good idea that Tosco should have its European headquarters in Dublin. Some people have said to me that this could be the best deal ever for INPC, Whitegate, Whiddy and the country, but we are moving into the unknown and there are uncertainties. In this context it is only right that we raise these questions.</P>
      <P>Another issue is the goodwill and the benefit of the business developed, albeit on a subsidised basis, since 1970. The Minister and others have said that this facility in Whitegate, including the workforce, is almost unique. The camaraderie, the sense of teamwork and the pride the workforce has in the operation is worth a lot &ndash; I do not think such goodwill could be purchased. The industrial relations record in the facility is second to none &ndash; I do not know if there was ever a strike &ndash; and the safety record is top class. There have been environmental issues over the years, but they have been very minor. It is like a family and the INPC management and staff are excellent neighbours and I would like to see this continue. I have been told that Tosco will also be aware of the importance of being good neighbours in the local community. This is a very important consideration. There is also a unique road loading facility, which is very important. When it came on stream it generated a lot of extra traffic on the roads.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for granting me permission to raise this important matter of the provision of a new national school in Daingean, County Offaly.</P>
      <P>On 12 June I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, asking the position regarding the provision of a new primary school at Daingean, County Offaly, the progress which had been made on this issue since the new primary school was sanctioned for Daingean two years ago and the reason for the delay in this development. The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
      <P>Architectural planning for an extension to Daingean National School, County Offaly is progressing. However, it is not possible at this point to give any indication as to the timetable for the provision of the accommodation.</P>
      <P>When I tabled this motion, I outlined that I intended to bring this reply to the attention of the Minister and of this House and that people in the area were very upset of the existing facilities in the school.</P>
      <P>I received queries from a large number of the parents of pupils at Daingean National School. The reason they approached me was that they are anxious about the poor state of the educational facilities provided for their children in the national school in Daingean. The situation is serious. The facilities are very unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents, the teachers and the children want the Minister for Education and Science to provide them with a proper school. These children need proper classrooms to be educated. They need proper facilities for meals in the school and they also need a proper library. The school needs <Col N="916" /> a principal's room. It needs proper toilet facilities and ancillary facilities such as good grounds and sports facilities. It is important to state that this work was sanctioned more than two years ago and the progress to date has been extremely limited.</P>
    <P>There are 228 pupils in the school, which has only six classrooms. There are eight meanstream teachers in the school, a principal teacher, a remedial teacher and a resource teacher. Therefore, there are 11 teachers in total in a school with only six classrooms.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty in that one class is held in a renovated old school, which was opened 18 years ago as a temporary facility. The members of Fine Gael hold their meetings in this school room and members of Fianna Fáil also hold their meetings there. It is not comfortable for meetings, even if there are only one or two held there every year, but it is certainly most unsuitable for children attending classes on a regular basis. In addition, there is a class held in a meeting room above the church which is accessed by a narrow stairway. Furthermore, all of the children and teachers must cross the road on a number of occasions during the day.</P>
    <P>The principal uses a portacabin as an office. The resource teacher also uses a portacabin and the remedial teacher works from a seven foot by eight foot storeroom. The school has long outlived its usefulness. At present it is only able to accommodate half the pupils.</P>
    <P>It is essential that a new school be provided at the earliest possible date. The parents are so upset and annoyed over this that in August, if no action is taken by the Department, they intend to highlight the situation further. They want to see significant progress by August.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the former Minister for Education and Science who is in the House to reply, to use his good offices to do all he can because it is essential that this new school is provided. It is unfair to have those children using such inadequate facilities. They require a new school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Daingean national school. At present, the school has a staffing level of a principal, eight mainstream classroom teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2000 was 220 pupils.</P>
      <P>The school's present facilities consist of six permanent classrooms in the main school building, one classroom in the nearby former school, a GP room, a remedial room and other limited ancillary accommodation on a 1.8 acre site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-term accommodation needs of this school were assessed and in January 2000, the Department of Education and Science approved the commencement of architectural planning for <Col N="917" /> an additional two permanent classrooms and ancillary accommodation at Daingean National School. Provision is also being made in the plans for a further two classrooms should the need arise.</P>
    <P>The initial stage one submission from the school's design team was examined by the Department's technical staff and in November 2000, approval was given to proceed to stages one, two and three of the architectural planning process. When these stages are received in the Department of Education and Science it will be considered as quickly as possible having regard to the very large number of school building projects being dealt with by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in view of the large number of school building projects being dealt with by the Department at present, it is not possible to provide a time scale as to when the improved accommodation will be provided.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the project will proceed as quickly as possible having regard to existing commitments and priorities. The Department of Education and Science is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at Daingean and I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister came into the House to address this important matter. I hope his presence here is an indication that there is good news forthcoming because for the past four years we have not heard any good news about Mulligar General Hospital.</P>
      <P>This hospital was completed in 1996 and commissioned in 1997. Some £7 million of taxpayers' money was spent on it. Unfortunately four floors still remain empty. There is not a bed in them. They are just empty shells.</P>
      <P>There has been one promise delivered after another about the facilities of this hospital. Senator Cassidy issues statements almost on a weekly basis saying the money is coming. I have spoken to the Minister, who says the money is coming and the project is getting bigger. The sum involved now stands at about £40 million. The Senator has brought down the money in his back pocket so often that I do not know where it has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that he met a deputation from the Midland Health Board on 11 April last. On that day he promised he would have a decision within three months. Those three months are rapidly running out. Ten weeks have gone by since that deputation visited the Minister. <Col N="918" /> I hope the Minister will be in a position to deliver tonight and to tell us the result of his deliberation. The situation is intolerable. There is a shortage of beds. Cubicles made to accommodate four beds very often accommodate six beds. They have, on occasion, had to accommodate seven beds. Can the Minister imagine the over-crowding that is causing? Can he imagine the lack of privacy and inconvenience it is causing to patients, doctors and nurses as they go about their job? Can he understand the feeling of staff in this hospital at the appointment of three consultants to the accident and emergency unit by the Midland Health Board? It was expected one consultant would go to each of the hospitals in Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise. It has now been decided to appoint the three consultants to Tullamore hospital. The staff take that as a snub and a downgrading of Mullingar hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister overturned the decision made by the Midland Health Board on breast cancer services. He decided Portlaoise should be the lead centre and allocated a sum of £500,000 for its development. This is another step in the downgrading of Mullingar hospital which is very disappointing. The time for promises is over. The time has come for the Minister to deliver. It was pressure from the public during the 1994 local elections which brought about the appointment of a project team. That team presented its report to the Midland Health Board which, in turn, presented it to the Minister in October last year. Four people from the Minister's Department were on that project team. I cannot understand why there is such a long delay in the Minister coming forward with approval for architectural planning.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has good news.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate tonight. I, like my colleague, cannot emphasise to the Minister the importance to the people of Longford and Westmeath of the completion of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital by equipping, extending and staffing same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase 2A which provided a new accident and emergency unit, x-ray unit and OPD department was completed in July 1997 and it was anticipated that phase 2B would follow. Nothing concrete has since happened except for foot dragging and side-stepping. The original phase 2B development included a certain amount but the Minister then established a project team in May 1999 which reported in November 2000 and his officials commenced processing the brief to bring it to its next stage. I accept that the Midland Health Board, as was its right, expressed the view that in the event of anticipated additional funding being made available for health services expansion under the national development plan, the Department would also commit itself to include ICU, CCU, rehabilitation unit, child and adolescent psychiatry, occupational therapy department, cater<Col N="919" /> ing department and day services in phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital.</P>
    <P>This was a sensible proposal and would lead to comprehensive facilities and health services being available to serve the expanding population of Longford and Westmeath who would only be getting what they deserve. We know the cost of such a project is estimated to be approximately £40 million. All we are seeking is an unequivocal commitment to provide the capital for expansion of this hospital. There is tremendous anger among the nurses who have to look across at an empty four storey block gathering moss. This is a critical infrastructural facility providing as it would an upgraded state of the art facility to accommodate the medical requirements of the people in these two counties. It would mean an additional 90 beds which is of critical importance to this hospital where, during the winter months, an occupancy rate of more than 130% prevails. This creates difficulties for the excellent staff at all levels as doctors and nurses have to work through cramped beds which makes it more onerous and difficult for these people who are already over-stretched and are doing their professional best in difficult and over-crowded conditions. I commend them for their professionalism and competency in such trying conditions. They must be applauded but they and their patients deserve better. The people are seething with anger. The Minister should not be surprised if a major street protest takes place this autumn.</P>
    <P>We were all awaiting, with Fianna Fáil candidates in place, positive news in this regard. Announcement of a decision in this area only means the people are getting what they deserve and what has been promised for the past ten years, nothing more. If the Minister thinks it will amount to a political stroke for electoral advantage, he can forget it. Our people are too wise to be taken in. It is only their money as taxpayers that they are getting back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the arguments made by both Deputies in terms of the overall issue and in particular in relation to breast cancer services and accident and emergency department consultants. The provision of accident and emergency consultants means a huge additional increase for the midlands area. It is a matter for An Comhairle, the body which structures consultancy posts, to decide on the structure and regionalised basis for the allocation of the posts. Just because they are located in one base does not mean they will not service the entire area, they will. That represents a very significant investment and enhancement of services as opposed to any downgrading of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, approved the establishment of a project team to commence the planning of phase 2B development at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in May 1999. In keeping with normal practice in major capital developments of this kind, the project team was asked to prepare a written design brief <Col N="920" /> for the development of phase 2B to include the following departments: pathology, theatres, general medicine, general surgery, day surgery, administration services, isolation facilities, staff changing room, staff rest rooms and acute psychiatric unit.</P>
    <P>The brief was received in my Department in November 2000 and the letter from the Midland Health Board which accompanied the brief indicated that the project team was anxious that the intensive care and coronary care be included in phase 2B. The project team also suggested that in the event of additional national development plan funding or other capital funding being made available, other departments not already included in phase 2B should proceed as part of the contract. These include, rehabilitation unit, child and adolescent psychiatry, occupational therapy, catering department, day services, other than surgical, and ICU-CCU.</P>
    <P>The additional accommodation is a substantial addition to the original phase 2B proposal for which the project team was appointed. That accounts for a huge increase in expenditure. When one adds that to the fact that the Midland Health Board did not prioritise this project in its national development plan indicative funding of £124 million over the period 2000-06, it is quite clear that additional demands have now been placed on the Exchequer and the Government of the day. When we took up office in 1996 there was no allocation for phase 2B. That should be put on the record also. I do not think Deputies on the other side of the House can crow about the situation.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors is under way on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by the Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the social partners. It is primarily focused on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-term. The findings of the review will be submitted to Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Longford-Westmeath project is being fully considered and evaluated in the context of bed review capacity. I can assure Deputies that Senator Cassidy and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, have been vigorous in their representations on this issue on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for the opportunity to raise this very important issue this evening. Elderly patients are being threatened with eviction from nursing homes because of the <Col N="921" /> Minister's failure to make decisions regarding increased allocations to health boards to introduce an enhanced subvention scheme.</P>
      <P>Eleven patients are, this week, facing discharge from a private nursing home in the Minister's constituency in Cork. Last week, an elderly man faced eviction from another nursing home in Cork. At the same time families throughout the country are accumulating massive debts with private nursing homes simply because the Minister is failing to make decisions on the review of the nursing homes subvention scheme undertaken by his Department in association with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The Minister's failure to make decisions means we are now facing a crisis whereby elderly people are being threatened with eviction and families are living in fear and trepidation. The Minister is well aware of the serious situation but is failing to act. He is on record saying he would not be bounced into a decision regarding enhanced subventions. His failure to make decisions means elderly people are effectively being bounced out of nursing homes. The Minister, who is a member of the Government with fat resources at its disposal, is effectively abandoning the elderly, the very people who built the economy. They are being left in a hopeless situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister's failure to act has also brought about a situation where a high percentage of acute hospital beds in all our public hospitals are occupied by elderly people who cannot be discharged home or to nursing homes because of a lack of nursing care.</P>
      <P>They cannot be accommodated in nursing homes because the beds are not available. Therefore, seriously sick people cannot get admission to hospital and cannot get treatment because the beds are occupied.</P>
      <P>This situation is making the waiting list crisis even worse, so I now ask the Minister for Health and Children to take immediate decisions regarding increased allocations to the health boards to ensure that the nursing home subvention scheme can be implemented, as recommended in the Ombudsman's report which was scathing in its criticism of the Minister and his Department. The Minister must also take immediate decisions on the expenditure review of the scheme, recently undertaken by his Department in association with the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate when he will make the resources available to the health boards, especially the Southern Health Board, where there is a crisis so that it can implement the Ombudsman's recommendations on the refund schemes to families who are obliged to sell family properties and exhaust family savings for their elderly parents and relations because of what may be termed irregular decisions by health boards as a result of directives from the Department of Health and Children? He is aware of the situation in Cork where 11 elderly people in their seventies and eighties are sick with worry because of the threat to their future. I urge him to make a <Col N="922" /> decision on the allocation to the Southern Health Board so that their plight and the plight of dozens of families throughout the region can be resolved. These people are sick with worry because of the crisis that has arisen with regard to family resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care.</P>
      <P>However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120, £150 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase since 1 April and is the first time the rates have been increased since the introduction of the scheme in 1993.</P>
      <P>Apart from the basic rates of subvention, a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands on the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, which the Deputy's party introduced when it was in Government.</P>

    <P>I am aware that the issue of paying enhanced subventions has been raised in the Southern Health Board area. I am also aware of, and concerned by, the threat by some nursing home owners to discharge patients. Article 15.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, provides for a minimum 14 days notice in the event of a person being discharged from a nursing home. The purpose of this minimum period of notice is to facilitate the exploration of all avenues prior to the discharge of a person from a <Col N="923" /> private nursing home and to ensure that alternative arrangements can be made. I am disappointed to learn that in this instance it appears that all avenues were not explored prior to older people, who may be vulnerable, being issued with notification of discharge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts will explain. Funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When the Government took office in 1997 the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million and an additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to <Col N="924" /> £52 million. Overall an additional £13 million has been allocated to the Southern Health Board for 2001 for services to the elderly. I do not accept that resources do not exist to prevent the discharge of these people next week.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. In the meantime, I wish to assure the Deputies that my Department will continue to liaise with all the health boards on a regular basis during the course of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise the very serious social and economic problems facing the town and rural areas of Castleblayney. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, for attending the House to reply to this matter.</P>
      <P>The community and family resource centre proposed for Castleblayney is a well thought out, community based and integrated response which the community is putting forward to improve the situation. If ever a town needed a lift in terms of economic and social funding it is Castleblayney, a town with a rich tradition in drama and music but with no performing centre.</P>
      <P>The proposal is for an integrated arts and community resource centre for the benefit of all the people of the town and surrounding area. The centre will include a theatre with two seating options, either of 246 or 86 seats and all the back-up rooms, workshops, crèche, parents and toddler area, Irish language and pre-school facilities, an active learning centre, an affordable fitness centre, computer training centre, administration offices for voluntary groups and meeting rooms. It is also proposed to have a centre foyer with coffee bar and many other facilities. All the main areas of the centre are already booked by groups who are giving invaluable services in rented and inadequate premises around the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Castleblayney has suffered since the formation of the State. Partition of the island in 1920 cut off the economic hinterland of the town and this, together with emigration and factory closures over the years has destroyed the economic base. The last straw for the town was the closure of the military barracks by the Government under the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith. The Minister came to Castleblayney in July 1998 to announce the closure of the barracks. He promised funding of £1 million for the town. He told the people and their political representatives that the funding was for a project or projects pro<Col N="925" /> posed by the people. This project, under the chairmanship of Sr. Celine McArdle, brings together Castleblayney Heritage Group, the drama festival committee, Castleblayney Players, Macra na Feirme and Blaney Blades, covering every aspect of life and training. It also covers Castleblayney Trust for the homeless, needy and unemployed.</P>
    <P>The site has been purchased and planning permission granted. The group has funding of over £0.25 million towards the project and the promised funding of £1 million is vital to gain other funds. The Minister for Defence has already stated on local Northern Sound radio that he supports the idea proposed by the Castleblayney group but he and the Government have reneged on this. There has been no funding of £1 million for the people of Castleblayney as promised. The North-Eastern Health Board is to build a centre on the Army site to look after difficult young people but this is being built under an order of the High Court. As there are no facilities in the North-Eastern Health Board region the matter is being dealt with in the courts. These children are technically known as children at risk.</P>
    <P>The town of Castleblaney has a proud tradition in music and drama including the Castleblaney Players and Castleblaney drama festival, together with personalities such as Paddy Cole, Big Tom, Anna McGoldrick, the late Maurice Lynch and Eamon Toal, who represented Ireland in last year's Eurovision. The important point is that the theatre project is backed by all these people together with and under the supervision of the two McArdles. Tommy and John McArdle, in common with the others I mentioned, have represented not only Castleblaney in Ireland but in a much wider field. John McArdle is spearheading the theatre section of the community project. Given the involvement of the McArdles in RTE and other national projects, his commitment speaks volumes.</P>
    <P>Castleblaney has the highest rate of unemployment in County Monaghan. In May 2000, the town had a total of 465 males and 335 females on the live register, over 45% of whom were long-term unemployed. The level of disadvantage in the county and town has been measured by the County Monaghan partnership board whose central office is located in Castleblaney. Its figures show that on a scale of one to ten, the Castleblaney urban area is at nine while the Castleblaney rural area has disimproved from five to six with the DEDs of Mullyash at ten, Churchill at nine and Annyalla and Cremartin at eight. Many of the town's schools are classified as disadvantaged by the Department of Education and Science. The North-Eastern Health Board's statistics show significant levels of child sex abuse in the town and there is a high rate of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The project has been properly researched. It involves the merger of two separate community based proposals, one for an arts/theatre facility and the other for a family community centre. The troubles have impacted socially and economically <Col N="926" /> and the project will receive funding from the Peace and Reconciliation programme, the IFI and the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The key is the £1.3 million from the ACCESS fund under the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands or the Department of Defence or both.</P>
    <P>The theatre will bring together people from the whole area, North and South of the Border. I cannot over-emphasise the amount of effort that has been put into this project by the people of Castleblaney. It has united the town like never before because everyone sees the need for it for all the reasons I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for giving me the opportunity to discuss this important project in his constituency. As he is aware, an allocation of a total of £36 million has been secured for the arts and culture enhancement support scheme, known as ACCESS, over the four years, 2001 to 2004.</P>
      <P>The primary aim of the scheme is to ensure that all our citizens have easy access to adequate venues for the creation, expression and appreciation of arts and culture, including our heritage. The scheme will assist the four main categories of arts and cultural infrastructure, namely, arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, and funds will be allocated under three broad strands.</P>
      <P>The first strand will address the provision of large scale infrastructure development for arts and cultural facilities to meet the demonstrated needs of a region, county or city. Projects qualifying under this strand will include those which facilitate the development of strategic partnerships between local authorities, the arts sector and other key players while addressing the provision of workshop spaces, studios, rehearsal areas, education and community arts facilities.</P>
      <P>Strand two relates to the redevelopment of existing facilities and venues, including new build, additional build or major refurbishments. This strand will target existing arts and cultural operators to facilitate major refurbishment of existing facilities and venues. As with strand one, operators will be encouraged to examine the possibility of entering into strategic partnerships with other operators in the field in order to share space and resources and maximise revenue funding.</P>
      <P>The third strand relates to community based projects. It will assist the development of smaller scale culture and arts facilities at local and community level, including new facilities or the refurbishment of existing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the ACCESS programme were announced in May 2000 and applications for grant assistance were invited in newspaper advertisements the following month. The deadline for receipt of applications was 31 October 2000 and, by that date, over 170 applications had been <Col N="927" /> received. The committee established to assess the applications for funding under the programme, including the application for the Le Cheile community arts and cultural facility in Castleblaney, County Monaghan, recently completed its work. It is expected that a determination will be made in the near future as to which projects will be approved for grant assistance.</P>
    <P>I take on board the Deputy's concerns regard<Col N="928" /> ing the need for such facilities in the Castleblaney area of which I am acutely aware. I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister, Deputy de Valera. Unfortunately, I cannot give a more definite response to the Deputy but it is anticipated that the Minister will be in a position soon to determine her allocations.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 June 2001.</P>

      <P>The precise information requested by the Deputy is not available. According to the 1994-95 household budget survey the average household spent £70.75 per week on all food items. Using the trends in the price of food items, as measured by the consumer price index, it is estimated that corresponding food baskets would cost £79.97 in April 1999, £81.85 in April 2000 and £88.15 in April 2001. This approach makes no allowance for changes in either the volume or pattern of food consumption in households since 1994-95.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental/Agency Review Group on Public Safety, sponsored by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, recommended,<i> inter alia</i>, the establishment of an office of public safety and that each Department needs to place public safety high among the concerns to be addressed in decision making and the development of public policy.</P>
      <P>In the course of its work, the review group noted the current system of self-regulation of the electrical contracting industry in Ireland. While the Health and Safety Authority has a general responsibility in the case of non-domestic installations in the context of the safety and health of workers, it does not have such a role in respect of domestic installations.</P>
      <P>I have always placed the highest priority on matters of public safety. It is for this reason that I have, through my Department, formally requested the Commission for Electricity Regulation to advise me on the potential of a role for the commission in the regulation of the electrical contracting industry and how it could best approach the performance and oversight of such an additional function in the most cost effective and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>The commission has confirmed to my Department that it is agreeable in principle to assuming this additional function. It has initiated work on devising an appropriate scheme for the regulation of the industry and identifying the financial and human resource requirements, as a basis for its recommendation to me. Additional staff have been recruited to facilitate the carrying out of this task and the commission has assured my Department that work on devising an appropriate scheme will be given priority.</P>
      <P>Legislative provisions for the assignment of this additional function to the Commission for Electricity Regulation could be included in the forthcoming electricity Bill, which subject to drafting is expected to be introduced in the autumn of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, I have received representations on behalf of the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland, RECI, and my officials have met RECI to discuss their proposals on the regulation of the electrical contracting industry. It has been suggested to them that it would be useful for them to contact the commission with any proposals they wish to make, including proposals for any interim non-statutory arrangements, in order that these can be taken into account by the com<Col N="931" /> mission in formulating its recommendations to me,</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office's Strategy 2000-2016 entitled, A Platform for Change, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 2 October 2000 provides an overall planning and investment framework for the development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area. The plan amplifies on the changes and investment necessary for the greater Dublin area set out in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Among the immediate priorities of the plan are the commencement of Luas operations in 2003 and further improvements of the suburban rail network. The Government has also approved, in principle, the development of a metro system by way of public private partnership. Initial planning work for the metro is now proceeding.</P>
      <P>I am also embarking on a process of regulatory and institutional reform to revitalise public transport and to find effective solutions to congestion. These proposals were set out in a Government consultation paper, published in September 2000, entitled, A new institutional and regulatory framework for public transport dealt with regulation of the bus market in the greater Dublin area and set out proposals for institutional reform of public transport. I am awaiting the response of the Public Transport Partnership Forum, a subcommittee of which is carrying out a comparative study in this area before submitting its views and my recommendations to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public consultation is also taking place on the Government proposals for a new authority to deal with land use and transport in the greater Dublin area. These proposals are set out in a consultation paper entitled, New Institutional Arrangements for Land Use and Transport in the Greater Dublin Area, published in April 2001. It <Col N="932" /> is proposed that the new strategic authority would have responsibility for strategic transport and land use planning and independent regulation of public transport.</P>
    <P>In summary, the plans and proposals I have outlined above are designed to spearhead a major investment and regulatory reform programme which will renew and upgrade Dublin's transport systems.</P>

      <P>For privatisation of Bord Gáis to take place it would be highly desirable to have put in place an independent statutory regulatory regime for the gas industry and necessary to have converted the company to plc status. A Bill to transfer the gas regulatory functions of the Minister to the Commission for Electricity Regulation, which is to be renamed, will be published shortly. Plc legislation will not be ready until next year.</P>
      <P>Against this background I am considering the recent submission from the board which favours an IPO and I have asked the board to also consider other means of meeting its capital requirements which are very significant for this year and next.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the contents of the recent OECD report regarding the lack of competition in the electricity industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18117/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland as a constructive contribution to the debate on regulatory reform in general and with regard to electricity in particular. The OECD report acknowledges that much has been accomplished in Ireland on restructuring of the electricity sector. It makes a number of recommendations to complete the process of introducing competition, some of which we have implemented. The more salient of the recommendations in the OECD report may be summarised as follows: decisive structural change, including the diminution of ESB's dominant position in generation, and the option of divestiture; non-discriminatory, cost-effective and independently regulated access to the transmission networks; development of an all-island electricity market; liberalisation of all consumers and consideration of further acceleration; and the independent regulator to be strengthened to speed up competition and investment.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to the liberalisation of the electricity market. I have demonstrated this in the Irish electricity industry by the actions I have taken to promote competition. In July 1999, I sponsored the Electricity Regulation Act as the first urgent step in the process of liberalisation. This legislation repealed regulatory powers that had been vested in ESB and established the independent Commission for Electricity Regulation to oversee market opening and regulate access to the grid.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, I signed the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations, 2000, which implemented the remainder of the electricity directive and which, in the main, provided for the establishment of an independent transmission system operator, known as EirGrid.</P>
      <P>My policy in the electricity sector, as in other sectors that have been liberalised, is to allow the incumbent to compete with market entrants. This policy approach has not prevented the advent of significant competition in the air transport and telecommunications sectors. I am pleased to note that independent power producers and suppliers have shown a keen interest in entering the Irish electricity market. In that regard, it is worth noting that, to date, the CER has issued 27 authorisations to build power stations, granted 32 generating licences, and granted 18 supply licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of access to the transmission networks, the CER is responsible for regulating and ensuring the conditions of access to the transmission and distribution grids and for approving the related tariffs. The ESB, in accordance with EirGrid's development plan, will engage in a <Col N="934" /> major investment programme which will see investment of £500 million in the transmission grid over the next five years. This investment, which will be closely monitored by the Cabinet subcommittee on infrastructure, will fully modernise Ireland's transmission system over this period.</P>
    <P>The achievement of an all-island energy market is a key policy objective being actively explored by both administrations. The final report of the consultancy study commissioned jointly earlier this year, which is expected in the next few weeks, will provide the basis for further progress in this regard. In the meantime, the initiative taken by me and Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey, in December 1999 to expand the cross-Border electricity interconnector from 280MW to 400MW, which will come on stream later this summer, will contribute to the development of cross border trade.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pace of liberalisation, I will be making an order this year to provide for accelerated liberalisation of the electricity market, moving to 40% in 2002, from the current level of about 31%. In accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, this order will require the passing of a resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas. About 1,400 customers will be eligible to choose their electricity supplier when 40% of the market is opened.</P>
    <P>In a little more than three and a half years, every electricity consumer will be able to choose his or her electricity supplier when the market will be fully opened. Both the markets for green energy and for combined heat and power have already been fully liberalised. I am pleased to say that, already, with the existing opening of the electricity market, more than 50% of eligible customers have moved to independent licensed suppliers and almost 6,000 customers to green suppliers.</P>
    <P>The OECD states that independent, well-resourced and well-respected regulatory institutions attract investment, thereby promoting competition. In my view, the OECD report has somewhat misinterpreted the situation regarding the legislative framework for the regulation of the electricity industry when it suggests that its regulatory powers can be withdrawn by me. The commission has been in place for nearly two years now and has been very active in underpinning an open, transparent and accountable regulatory process for the electricity industry. It is fully and legally independent in the performance of its functions and accountable in this respect to a joint committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The overall thrust of the Government's policy on the development of competition in electricity is broadly in line with that suggested by the OECD. I agree with the OECD report that we should move as quickly as we can to achieve full and robust competition. I can assure the House that that is the objective which I and my Depart<Col N="935" /> ment are working towards in an orderly and expeditious manner.</P>

      <P>Consultants, commissioned by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, are currently finalising a strategic plan for the Cork area covering the period up to 2020. My Department is represented on the advisory group for the plan.</P>
      <P>A draft final report has been prepared which places strong emphasis on new public transport projects to support future population growth and residential and other developments in the area covered by the strategic plan. The draft report recommends upgrading rail services on the Mallow-Cork-Cobh rail corridor and developing rail services between Blarney and Midleton which would involve the re-opening of the Cork-Midleton line consistent with the national development plan proposals for the line.</P>
      <P>The draft report also proposes a significant role for bus based public transport, park and ride facilities and bus priority and car restraint measures as a means of increasing the public transport modal share. In this regard, I am particularly concerned that strong and effective bus priority and car restraint measures must be put in place to support and sustain public transport investment in urban areas.</P>

The strategic plan requires to be endorsed by the of members of Cork County Council and Cork Corporation and when the report is published, my Department along with Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann will evaluate the public transport proposals as a basis for future public transport investment in the area.</P>

      <P>In July 2000, the Government approved, in principle, the development of a metro for Dublin on a public private partnership basis. The decision was taken following proposals in the Dublin Transportation Office strategy document, A Platform for Change, in which a metro was identified as a significant component in providing an integrated public transport system to cater for likely demands to 2016.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> Following the Government decision, I asked the Light Rail Project office to commence the necessary preparatory work for the metro. The following progress has taken place to date: a public consultation process was commenced and has met with enthusiastic response; a market consultation exercise has just been completed and the responses received from a significant number of interested parties are being assessed at present and the LRPO development of route alignments and traffic modelling has been progressing. I will be bringing specific proposals to the Government in the coming weeks in relation to the development of the metro with a view to initiating the procurement process for the first phase later in the year.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for procuring the metro will be given to the railway procurement agency when established. The Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001, has been passed by Seanad Éireann and I hope to move the Second Stage in the Dáil later this month.</P>
    <P>The latest projections from the DTO suggest that the cost of the metro, as proposed, would be £5.7 billion, with annual operating cost of £120 million per annum in 2001 prices. The DTO has recommended that most of the system should be completed by 2010 with the first phase connecting the city centre to Dublin Airport and Blanchardstown, at an indicative cost of around £2 billion. The RPA, when established, will provide a more detailed indicative timetable and cost projections for the development of the system.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer provision for railway safety in 2001 is £102 million. This is in line with the expenditure profile in the Railway Safety Programme 1999 to 2003, which was approved by the Government in March 1999. Iarnród Éireann advised my Department on 7 June that it had reviewed its railway safety expenditure priorities in the light of available funding and that it had decided to renew a total of 75 miles of track in 2001, in line with the overall target for this year set out in the safety programme. This would mean that by end 2001 a total of 247 miles would be renewed, compared with a programme target of 242.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to available resources and relative priorities, Iarnród Éireann had tentatively planned to exceed the programme target of 75 miles in 2001 by an additional 12 miles. The return to the original programme target of 75 miles affected an additional 4.5 miles of track renewal on the Westport line and one mile on the <Col N="937" /> Sligo line. No additional mileage was planned on the Tralee line. It is my view that Iarnród Éireann should implement the full track renewal programme for this year and I have asked my officials to convey this view to the company. I have also asked my Department to carry out an early review of the scope for the possible provision of some additional funding for railway safety in 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan, in recognition of the urgent need for additional peak hour capacity, provides for significant investment in suburban rail services, including DART, in the greater Dublin area. Iarnród Éireann has ordered 12 new DART carriages to enter service in 2002. These are in addition to the 26 new DART carriages, which have entered service since October last year. These new carriages will have provided a 50% increase in the capacity of the DART system by the end of 2002. Iarnród Éireann also plan to purchase a further 36 new DART cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Iarnród Éireann has submitted investment proposals to my Department for a major upgrade in the DART network to provide further significant increases in capacity beyond 2002. The proposals provide for the lengthening of platforms to accommodate eight car trains, a major upgrade of the signalling capacity to allow an increased number of trains in the city centre area and increased power supply for operating the enhanced network. My Department is in ongoing detailed discussions with Iarnród <Col N="939" /> Éireann in relation to these proposals. In 2001 £3.5 million was allocated by my Department in respect of planning and design work for the DART upgrades. Further details of the timescales involved will be determined as planning and design progresses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I do not see that the OECD recommendation poses a threat to the development of the two new stations in the context of the closure of the existing ones. The recommendation on the use of peat in electricity generation is one of a number of recommendations contained in the recent review of regulatory reform in Ireland. This review of the regulatory situation in Ireland is one of a series of country reports carried out under the OECD regulatory reform programme aimed at assisting member Governments in improving the quality of regulation.</P>
      <P>The OECD report represents a useful contribution towards the issue of regulatory reform in Ireland. Given its isolated position and island status, Ireland has traditionally followed a multi-fuel policy in the generation of electricity in the interest of security of supply. Peat is an indigenous fuel which has been used to lessen our exposure on the security of supply front. The issue of supply security is acknowledged in the EU electricity directive which allows member states to give priority to the dispatch of generating plants using indigenous fuel up to 15% in any calendar year. In line with this provision and our traditional security policy, it was agreed in early 2000 in the context of the future liberalised electricity industry in Ireland to phase out the existing old peat stations and to replace them with two new ESB peat plants at Lanesboro and Shannonbridge. Preparations for these two plants are on track. The operation of these new plants and the IVO plant in Edenderry will be the subject of a public service obligation, the finalisation of which is currently the subject of discussion with the EU Commission in Brussels.</P>

      <P>There is no arrangement whereby BNFL would provide monthly reports to the RPII on the implementation of the safety improvements recommended in the RPII's report of December 2000 on the storage of high level waste at Sellafield. However, the RPII is continuing to maintain regular contact with the UK nuclear installations inspectorate and BNFL in regard to BNFL's progress in implementing the safety recommendations contained in the RPII report.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 27 on 27 March 2001, I referred to a number of the RPII's safety recommendations which have been carried out by BNFL. While I welcome the progress by BNFL in addressing the RPII's safety recommendations, I would like to emphasise that the long-term storage of large quantities of high level liquid waste at Sellafield is not acceptable to the Government and I am continuing to press the UK to accelerate the current process at Sellafield for vitrifying the liquid waste.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the Energy Security and the Information Society Report commissioned from DKM Economic Consultants.</P>
      <P>My Department, Forfás and the Taoiseach's Department, following a competitive tender process, recruited DKM consultants in September 2000. DKM's bid was the most economically advantageous and cost £54,877.</P>
      <P>The objective in engaging DKM was to quantify and assess the impact of investment in co-location, complex web hosting, web farming, advanced data processing and similar e-commerce related facilities on the energy demand and supply situation in Ireland. DKM was also asked to advise on the appropriate investment, regulatory and legislative measures needed to ensure that Ireland remained competitive in attracting and retaining this type of investment.</P>
      <P>The report was finalised at the end of January and its recommendations studied. The report recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, a full deregulation of the CHP market. I have done this through section 9(f2&gt;a)(ii) of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
      <P>The report has been circulated to all the relevant Government Departments and to EirGrid and the Commission for Electricity Regulation. It is also available on the Department's website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DKM report represents a further contribution to the evolution of policy making in the telecommunications and energy sectors. In the latter regard, all demands for energy continue to be met and the large-scale investment programmes, which are being undertaken by ESB, Eirgrid and BGE over the next five years, will <Col N="942" /> provide the country with an energy infrastructure to international standard.</P>

      <P>I fully support the development of our indigenous energy resources, on or offshore, which have positive environmental and economic benefits. In October last, together with Sir Reg Empey MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I published a joint study of the offshore wind energy potential, Assessment of Offshore Wind Energy Resources in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. One of the headline findings in that report was that at a minimum distance of five kilometres offshore in a maximum water depth of 20 meters there is a potential resource to contribute in excess of 30% of the island's electricity consumption.</P>
      <P>Some months previously my colleague the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahy, had published administrative and licensing arrangements for offshore exploration of possible offshore sites. There are currently four companies with licenses to explore the suitability of seven offshore sites for the construction and operation of wind parks to generate electricity.</P>
      <P>The costs of connecting offshore wind parks to the national grid is a matter in the first instance for EirGrid and the Commissioner for Electricity Regulation. Should any support measure specific to offshore development arise it will require prior clearance by the European Commission under State aid rules. A standard condition of State aid applications is the submission of data on eligible costs and levels of aid intensity. This data can be estimated only under reasonable assumptions after the current exploratory works are concluded.</P>
      <P>I will continue to track progress on the exploratory work. It is my intention to discuss appropriate support measures for the development of the industry once the research data are submitted to me.</P>

      <P>Up to the end of 1999, the Waterford to Dublin line benefited substantially from invest<Col N="943" /> ment of £10.7 million under the EU Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, launched in November 1999, provides £500 million for the mainline rail renewal and upgrading programme and I understand from Iarnród Éireann that work is progressing satisfactorily on all lines including the Waterford to Dublin line.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was spent on the enhancement of the line during 2000 and a further £5 million will be spent during 2001. The work to date has involved the replacement of life expired jointed tracks on timber sleepers with continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers. Iarnród Éireann expects the work to be completed by end 2003 and passengers will see improvements of up to ten minutes on the journey time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the possibility of a public service obligation or PSO flight between Waterford Airport and Dublin. The EU Commission previously rejected proposals for a PSO route linking Waterford and Dublin on the grounds that the distance involved is relatively short and that the route is adequately served by other transport modes.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the authorities in Waterford Airport were successful in securing a new air carrier, Euro-Celtic, for the Waterford-Luton route with the commencement of a daily return service in February 2001. This was increased to two daily rotations last month. I understand Waterford Airport also has plans for the future to develop additional services to the UK.</P>
      <P>I am aware, and I know that the authorities in Waterford Airport are also conscious of this, that any proposal for a Dublin-Waterford flight service, aside from the EU Commission context, could have potential to impact negatively on the authorities' efforts to develop and sustain UK routes. My Department is assisting those efforts through the provision of a substantial marketing grant to the tune of £200,000 this year. Nevertheless, I would have any application from Waterford Airport for a Waterford-Dublin PSO carefully examined and assessed by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Government's Green Paper on sustainable energy, published by my Department in 1999, identified housing as an area requiring a major application of innovation to improve its energy performance and associated greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2000, I launched a consultative forum on the &ldquo;House of Tomorrow&rdquo; initiative, which will provide a programme of energy related research, demonstration and development support actions for the housing sector to meet Ireland's specific needs and circumstances. This is aimed at establishing least cost solutions applicable both to new build and upgrading of the existing housing stock. The forum drew on a wide range of backgrounds <Col N="945" /> and experience from professional, trade, industrial and specialist practitioners in the housing and energy fields. In particular, it invited views regarding priority topics for attention through practical research, demonstration and development support actions, and solar energy was among the topics considered.</P>
    <P>From an environmental emissions perspective, solar heating has obvious attractions. However, from an economic and operational perspective, it is clear that solar technology still needs adaptation and proving under Irish conditions so as to attain wide consumer and building industry acceptance. This will, therefore, be among the topics to be addressed by the House of Tomorrow programme when it is launched later this year.</P>
    <P>In this context, at my request, the Irish Energy Centre is investigating the scope for a pilot programme which would subsidise the installation of a limited number of demonstration solar roofs. If successful, this will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology on a scale sufficient to influence uptake by householders and builders alike and could provide an Irish experience base on which to go forward with further initiatives for solar heating.</P>

Section 76 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, makes it clear that the holder of an aquaculture licence is entitled to the ownership of the stock cultivated in accordance with the licence. Criminal law already provides for the prosecution of theft</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the bottom culture of mussels involves the placement of mussel seed on suitable areas of the sea bed where, in due course, the seed matures to mussels of marketable size. However, as this method of cultivating shellfish does not require any equipment in or on the water, it can be difficult to precisely determine whether a vessel is engaged in dredging within the boundaries of a licensed site or is merely operating close by. Most of the waters in Carlingford are unlicensed and are a public fishery in which any vessel is entitled to fish.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid inadvertent encroachment, my Department has widely circulated the latitudinal and longitudinal co-ordinates of the licensed sites and has indicated to operators within the lough that only the recognised licence holders are entitled to lay, relay or harvest shellfish within those sites.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 88 of 13 February 2001 and to Parliamentary Question No. 102 of 27 March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to those parliamentary questions, I referred to the marine radioactivity monitoring and research programme carried out throughout the year by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &ndash; RPII &ndash; and to the results of the programmes produced and published by the RPII in a series of bi-annual reports. These reports include full results of all of the analyses made and detailed evaluations of their significance. The <Col N="948" /> most recent of these reports covers the period 1998-99. Current results are published on the Institute's website each quarter.</P>
    <P>The significant source of radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea is the discharge of low level radioactive liquid waste from BNFL's nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Since 1994, the discharges of technetium-99 were increased significantly when the UK authorities granted BNFL an increase in their discharge limit for technetium-99 from 10 TBq per annum to 200 TBq per annum. In addition, the remobilisation of radionuclides, particularly caesium-137, deposited on the sediments of the Irish Sea is now an important source of contamination of the seawater of the western Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The consumption of fish and shellfish from the Irish Sea is the dominant pathway through which radioactive contamination of the marine environment results in radiation exposure of Irish people. A heavy consumer of seafood from the north-west Irish Sea would receive an exposure of about 1.5 microsieverts in a year, considerably below the average annual dose to a person in Ireland of about 3000 microsieverts from all sources of radiation. Caesium-137 remains the dominant radionuclide accounting for approximately 60% of the doses received by the Irish consumer and technetium-99 for approximately 20%.</P>
    <P>The continued contamination of the Irish marine environment from the Sellafield plant is totally unacceptable and I am continuing to exert maximum pressure on the UK authorities for the cessation of all radioactive discharges.</P>

      <P>My overall approach to State-funded rail investment in the greater Dublin area is to exploit more fully the potential for the development of the suburban rail network. Clearly low income households depend significantly on public transport and, therefore, decisions on investment take account of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual decisions about rail stops on existing suburban lines are a matter for Iarnród Éireann which is required to operate its services as efficiently as possible within the annual subvention provided by the Exchequer. The Dublin Transportation Office's strategy, A Platform for Change, includes rail stops at Ballyfermot and Inchicore. The Luas line between Tallaght and <Col N="949" /> the city centre planned for 2003 will also service part of Ballyfermot and Inchicore. Furthermore, the DTO strategy recommends a Luas line from Lucan to Docklands via Ballyfermot to be constructed in the period between 2006 and 2010. This would interchange with the suburban rail line at Ballyfermot.</P>

      <P>A condition of completion of the proposed disposal of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation's business and principal commercial assets to the Tosco Corporation is the establishment of an employee share ownership programme &ndash; ESOP. The intention is to enable the employees to hold shares in their employer. Following a series of meetings between representatives of the trades unions and senior officials of my Department and the Department of Finance, the trades unions agreed to recommend a particular offer to their members. I understand that agreement has since been reached between INPC management and trades union representatives as to how the proposed ESOP should be implemented, and that the offer has been sent for a ballot.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the legal provisions in respect of ESOPs generally, and given that, in line with normal practice, the purpose of the proposed ESOP in this instance is to provide an incentive to current employees and to ensure their co-operation and assistance in bringing the proposed disposal to a successful conclusion, it is not envisaged that those who are not employees of the INPC at the time of completion will be covered by the proposed ESOP. INPC pensioners will continue to receive benefits in respect of their former service with the company in the form of their pension entitlements, as the existing pension schemes, which I understand from the company are fully funded, will transfer to the new owner on completion of the proposed transaction.</P>

The ship, to be <Col N="950" /> named <i>LE Niamh</i>, is a replacement for <i>LE Deirdre</i> which has reached the end of its economic life and has been decommissioned.</P>
      <P>During &ldquo;builders&rdquo; sea trials, which take place in advance of customer acceptance sea trials, a problem arose with the port gearbox on the ship. Subsequent examinations indicated that there was also a problem with the starboard gearbox on the ship. The contractual issues in regard to both gearboxes are being addressed by Appledore Shipbuilders Limited with the manufacturer of the gearboxes, Scam Volda of Norway. My Department and the Naval Service are in daily contact with Appledore Shipbuilders Limited on developments in this regard.</P>
      <P>When both gearboxes are reinstated and re-commissioned, the ship will undergo customer acceptance sea trials which will be attended by representatives of the Department of Defence and the Naval Service. These sea trials are now scheduled for the second week of July 2001. When these trials are complete, and everything is going well, the ship will be officially handed over to the Department. The ship will then sail to Haulbowline and will enter operational service as soon as possible thereafter. The ship was originally scheduled for delivery in September 2001.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in this year's Finance Act, the various tax reliefs for third level education were merged into a single relief and the scope of the relief was considerably widened. Generally, the new relief now covers fees paid by undergraduate students in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU. The scheme also applies to fees paid by postgraduate students both here and abroad. In the course of the recent review of the reliefs, I considered whether tax relief should be extended to fees paid by undergraduate students studying outside the EU but decided against this because of concerns about controlling the types and standards of courses which might attract tax relief. I will bear in mind the Deputy's proposal in the context of any future review of the relief.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in County Cork and County Kerry is a matter for the Southern Health Board. As mentioned by the Deputy, the board has adopted a strategy, Ageing with Confidence, for the people of Cork and Kerry for the development of services for older people.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2001-2006, a total of £35.487 million is being provided to the Southern Health Board for capital investment in the development of services for older people. It is a matter for the board to decide its priority developments within the national development plan. Additional revenue funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from £10 million in 1997 to an additional £57.427 million in 2001, including nursing home subvention funding.</P>

    <P>My Department has allocated more than £13 million in additional funding to the Southern Health Board in 2001 for the further development of services for older people throughout Cork and Kerry.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health related services to people with sensory disabilities and the accountability for funding allocated for the provision of such services is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. The health boards may provide services directly themselves or fund a voluntary agency to provide the services on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The two main voluntary service providers currently involved in the provision of services to people with sensory disabilities are the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and the National Association for Deaf People. As well as providing funding to support residential services at St. Joseph's home for the deaf in Cabra, St. Joseph's House for the adult deaf-blind in Stillorgan and St. Joseph's school for the blind in Drumcondra, between 1997 and 1999, a total of £1.051 million has been allocated by the health boards for the development of a range of support services specifically for people with sensory disabilities, including rehabilitation and family support services, social work services, mobility training and psychology services. People with sensory disabilities may also avail of home support services, day care services and respite services if required.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1999, additional funding of £5 million has been provided to the health boards each year for the provision of aids and appliances for people with physical and sensory disabilities. In identifying and processing waiting lists for such aids and appliances, the health boards consult extensively with the voluntary sector, including agencies providing services to people with sensory disabilities. From this funding, a large number of individuals with sensory disabilities have been provided with the appropriate equipment to enable them to live as independently and to participate as fully as possible within their community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the funding outlined, between 1999 and 2000, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind has received a total of £1.25 million capital fund<Col N="957" /> ing for the re-development and expansion of its centre in Model Farm Road, Cork. This funding is additional to the £100,000 ongoing revenue being provided to this organisation by the Southern Health Board since 1999. This level of funding has enabled the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind to reduce its waiting list for new applicants for their first guide dog to be reduced from three years to just 12 months. This centre also provides long cane training to the blind and visually impaired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was not intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120 and £150 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high and maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting <Col N="958" /> increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When the Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000, that figure had risen to £38.479 million. An additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. In the meantime, my Department will continue to liaise with all the health boards on a regular basis during the course of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 requires local authorities to undertake an assessment of the need for,<i> inter alia</i>, transient halting sites for Travellers and to have regard to the provision of such sites in the accommodation programmes adopted under the Act, having regard to the annual patterns of movement by Travellers. It is envisaged that the increased provision of accommodation, including the provision of transient sites, resulting from the implementation of the local accommodation programmes will greatly reduce the incidence of unauthorised parking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 Act also provided new and improved powers for local authorities to deal with incidents of unauthorised Traveller encampments on public land and on the roadside. Briefly, section 32 of the 1998 Act empowers local authorities to act where; an unauthorised temporary dwelling is within five miles of a serviced site provided by any housing authority or voluntary body with the assistance of a housing authority where the dwelling could be accommodated on such site; an unauthorised temporary dwelling is in poor condition or interferes with amenities or is likely to <Col N="961" /> be a risk to personal or public health or safety where the dwelling could be accommodated on another serviced site; an unauthorised temporary dwelling is within one mile of any Traveller accommodation provided by the housing authority or approved voluntary body.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these provisions is to protect residents in Traveller accommodation and those resident in the vicinity of that accommodation. Guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to these provisions.</P>
    <P>There are other powers available to local authorities such as those available under the Planning Acts in relation to unauthorised development and under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, in relation to the prohibition of temporary dwellings in certain areas. Controls under environmental, litter, public health legislation and the legislation relating to the control of dogs and horses are also available to local authorities to deal with unacceptable behaviour which may arise from the use of temporary dwellings. A local authority's powers to make bye-laws in relation to the use of temporary dwellings under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, have been strengthened under the Local Government Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Under the Roads Acts vehicles must not be parked in a manner which interferes with the normal flow of traffic or which obstructs or endangers other Traffic. The Road Traffic Act, 1961, expressly prohibits the parking of a vehicle in a dangerous manner. Enforcement of these provisions is generally a matter for An Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community recommends, in its first progress report, that the operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, should be reviewed in 2002, two years into the delivery of the Traveller accommodation programmes. Any review would therefore include <i>inter alia</i> the provisions dealing with unauthorised encampments. Arrangements for carrying out such a review will be considered in due course.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the new living over the shop scheme, which applies an integrated tax incentive package to tackle the problem of vacant upper storey space over commercial premises in the five major cities.</P>
      <P>The new scheme aims to build on progress achieved under a previous scheme introduced in 1994. The new scheme allowed the county boroughs greater flexibility in selecting streets through the operation of a maximum street length rather than a small number of named streets as had applied under the 1994 scheme. This facilitated the designation of a large number of streets in the various central areas of the five county boroughs.</P>
      <P>Another change is that some limited new build is allowed whereas the earlier scheme comprised refurbishment incentives only. A customised package of tax incentives covering both residential and commercial incentives is available. While the focus of the scheme is on the refurbishment and conversion of existing buildings for residential use, the limited new build is being allowed to facilitate access, to provide essential residential facilities, to restore streetscapes and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Commercial incentives are also allowed but expenditure on this cannot exceed total expenditure on the residential element. Commercial incentives are confined to retail only, excluding financial services and mail order businesses. There are no incentives for office or industrial development.</P>
    <P>The five county borough corporations were asked last September to submit to my Department by 15 December 2000, proposals for the selection of streets in line with criteria drawn up by my Department. The proposals submitted by the corporations were then assessed by an independent expert advisory panel, which made recommendations on the streets to be designated. In the region of 13,000 metres of street were subsequently designated for tax incentives under the scheme, which runs from 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2004.</P>
    <P>Details of the streets designated are available from relevant local authorities. Property owners-developers, etc. who own premises on the streets designated should contact the local authority in relation to their proposals; certification guidelines for the scheme are currently being prepared by my Department and will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 5 March 2001. She has been assessed with weekly means of £44.26 derived from her spouse's earnings and farming. Her weekly entitlement to carer's allowance at the date of her claim was £94 per week. However, as she was in receipt of unemployment benefit at £85.50 personal rate and £13.20 child <Col N="965" /> dependant allowance, there was no advantage to her in claiming carer's allowance at that stage.</P>
      <P>On 28 March 2001 the case was submitted to an investigation officer of the Department for a means assessment and to determine that the conditions for receipt of carer's allowance are satisfied. His completed report was received in the carer's allowance section on 12 June 2001.</P>
      <P>However, arising from the improvement which I introduced this year in the carer's allowance means tests, she qualifies for a personal rate of carer's allowance amounting to £132.80 with effect from 5 April 2001. This represents the maximum weekly rate paid to a person under 66 years of age caring for more than one care recipient.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently being made to have the relevant books issued to her designated post office as soon as possible. She will be notified when the books are available there for collection. Arrears of allowance due will issue shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>Specific training programmes have always been provided for both the specialist and general staff of my Department, with particular emphasis on the operational requirements of the Department as a whole. In recent times much good work has been done to extend various training modules to industrial staff. Courses cover a wide range of topics, including health and safety training, supervisory management, interviewing skills, vocational skills, stress management etc. My Department is also currently engaged in extensive craft apprenticeship training. Support is also given to staff members, at all levels, who are undertaking a wide range of elective training courses, from extra-mural certificate to post-graduate level.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that my Department's embryonic training unit has now been fully staffed. In the coming months all members of my Department's staff will have the opportunity to benefit from this very welcome progress. Shortly, the training unit's new programme of courses will be circulated to staff. Training has been one of the key priorities of my Department's partnership committee, resulting in the establishment of a partnership sub-group to focus specifically on training and development matters. The valuable input from staff, unions and management to this forum has already greatly informed the future strategies that will be adopted by the training unit. It has also been decided to engage consultants to prepare a training needs analysis for the industrial staff of my Department.</P>
      <P>In common with all other Government Departments, the merit award scheme is one that has only applied to staff covered by the Civil Service General Council Scheme for Conciliation and Arbitration. Following discussions with staff and union interests at the partnership committee, I am pleased that my Department took the initiative to have the scheme extended to industrial staff. The Minister for Finance has recently sanctioned my request to extend the scheme and my Department will shortly engage with staff interests with a view to arranging implementation.</P>

      <P>It is quite normal practice to engage clerks of works on large-scale projects. In the case of the Main Guard, it was necessary to engage a clerk of works with a background and experience in conservation of historic structures. It is difficult to procure such clerk of works services as there is little demand for them outside of State-sponsored conservation projects. The retired employee of Dúchas in question was the only such suitable clerk of works known at the time and he was duly commissioned for the project.</P>
      <P>Consultants' services are otherwise normally commissioned from the wider private sector. Consultants' services are commissioned on an WP extended char 4,29as needed' basis in keeping with Government practice and where it is clear that it is more economical to commission consultants for relevant once-off projects, irrespective of duration, rather than recruit permanent staff.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>I will address the case of the first prisoner referred to in the details supplied regarding his application for transfer to Ireland to serve the remainder of his sentence under the Council of Europe Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 and 1997. The transfer application of the prisoner concerned was received in my Department in December 1998. The prisoner wrote to my Department in May 1998 and the formal application was received from United Kingdom authorities in December 1998.</P>
      <P>I approved this application in July 1999. The main delay in this case was due to the need for further documentary evidence to be furnished by the United Kingdom authorities in order to satisfy the requirements of a High Court application. I can confirm that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor has informed my Department that a successful application for the issue of a transfer warrant regarding this prisoner was made in the High Court on 24 May 2001. The warrant will be forwarded to my Department in short course and a transfer can be effected shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>The transfer application with respect to the second named prisoner was received in my Department in January 2000. The prisoner concerned wrote to my Department in May 1999 and his formal application was received from the United Kingdom authorities in January 2000. I approved this application in October 2000. The main delay in this case was again due to the need for further documentary evidence to be furnished by the United Kingdom authorities in order to satisfy the requirements of a High Court application. I can confirm that on 5 June 2001 my Department sent sworn affidavits to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. The Office of the Chief State Solicitor is now proceeding with an application to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the prisoner concerned into this jurisdiction. It is expected that this warrant can be obtained before the courts go into summer recess and that a transfer can take place shortly after receipt of this warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> The transfer application with respect to the third named prisoner was received in my Department in July 1999. I approved this application in March 2001.</P>
    <P>The principal cause of delay in this case arose from the requirement to confirm that the prisoner concerned had sufficient ties in Ireland to justify a transfer. This confirmation is necessary in order to ensure that a prisoner will have sufficient family support upon release in Ireland. It took several months to receive relevant reports, which confirmed that the prisoner's ties with this country were sufficiently strong to justify his transfer. Now that this step has been completed, I have consented to the transfer and I understand that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is now preparing drafts of the affidavits to be sworn by my Department which will be used in the application to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the prisoner concerned into this jurisdiction. My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, hope to complete this High Court application process as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that, under the Council of Europe Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 and 1997, no prisoners have as yet transferred into Ireland from prisons outside the country in 2001. Some 43 prisoners are currently awaiting transfer to Ireland. The average length of time from date of making application to date of actual transfer has been calculated as 18 months. Four applicants are awaiting warrants to be issued for their transfer to Ireland. My Department expects to receive two warrants for transfer before the courts go into summer recess with the actual transfers expected to take place shortly after receipt of warrants. The period a prisoner must wait for a transfer to Ireland varies, according to individual circumstances; however, the longest period was three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lengthy application process is due to the fact that several legal requirements need to be satisfied before a transfer can take place. Under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 and 1997, I must be satisfied that the acts or omissions constituting the offence of the applicant would also constitute an offence <Col N="971" /> under Irish law before I can consent to a transfer.

    <P>After I consent to a transfer, my Department must then obtain the consents of the prisoner and the relevant foreign authorities. These consents are then forwarded to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, which prepares draft affidavits to be amended if necessary and sworn by my Department. With the sworn affidavits, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor can apply for a High Court warrant authorising a transfer into this jurisdiction.</P>

    </P>
    <P>I would point out in relation to the number of applications currently in the asylum determination process that this figure represents applications on hands at 31 May 2001 including applications made up to that date.</P>
    <P>While the number of cases on hands is some 13,300, our experience has shown that the actual number of persons currently awaiting a determination is less than this figure. It would appear that in reality, significant numbers are no longer in the asylum system.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that a large number of persons fall out of the asylum process for various reasons. Approximately 4,000 persons dropped out of the direct provision arrangements in the last year while the rate of applicants who fail to attend for their scheduled interview is on average around 40%. It is reasonable to conclude that many of these left the jurisdiction also.</P>
    <P>I believe that the greatest service we can provide to those who will be recognised as refugees is to ensure that their claims are decided speedily and that our regulations do not serve to attract large numbers of non-genuine applicants to the detriment of the genuine cases. To this end the Government has committed substantial resources to receiving and processing asylum seekers with the recruitment and training of almost 400 additional staff. This will bring the total number of staff serving in the asylum and immigration areas to more than 600.</P>
    <P>The Government now has in place a comprehensive asylum strategy, which is aimed at greatly increasing processing capacity to deliver more speedy decisions in relation to applications for refugee status leading to: the completion to finality of the processing of all new asylum applications within a six-month period; the processing of the asylum applications currently on hands as soon as possible; and dealing with the increased numbers of repatriations, which are expected to arise in respect of persons who do not qualify for refugee status.</P>
    <P>The major impact of this strategy will be progressively in evidence from the autumn onwards.</P>

A special rate of remuneration is being made available to teachers and special needs assistants participating in the delivery of the July programmes. In addition, extra remuneration is being offered to principals of participating schools in respect of the preparatory work involved in developing the July programmes. Schools participating in the programme will also receive a special rate of capitation funding in respect of participating children, amounting to 1.5 times the normal monthly captitation rate for children with autism. Funding is also available for transport arrangements for participating children. I am confident that this extension of service through the month of July will prove to be of major benefit to the pupils concerned.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of schemes, administered by the local authorities and vocational education committees, which provide for means-tested higher education grants to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice of recent years has been to increase third level maintenance grants at least in line with inflation and the reckonable income limits at least in line with movements in the average industrial wage. My Department expects to issue the 2001 higher education grants scheme shortly, with details of revised rates of maintenance grants and revised income limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> Also, I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present-day third level students.</P>
    <P>This review, which is in progress, is wide-ranging and covers many topics. These include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation.</P>
    <P>Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. For example, costings of the effect of changes in the income limits, below which applicants become eligible for a grant, have been commissioned and carried out for the special review. However, I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    <P>With regard to accommodation costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government has introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student-rented residential accommodation in the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and as such represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act, 2001, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for tax relief in respect of postgraduate fees paid for third level education in private and publicly funded third level colleges in non-EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extension of the scope of tax relief on tuition fees, to include fees paid in respect of study in non-EU countries, at undergraduate level, is a matter for decision by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. In this regard, I understand that the <Col N="978" /> Deputy has put down an identical question for answer by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 515 of 12 June 2001, the concerns raised by the Deputy on behalf of Dialogue Ireland relate to curriculum provision. I suggest that the Deputy makes contact with the office of the Secretary General of my Department so that a meeting can be set up between Dialogue Ireland, the relevant officers of my Department and representatives of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. I hope that this meeting will give Dialogue Ireland the opportunity to discuss all matters that concern them.</P>
