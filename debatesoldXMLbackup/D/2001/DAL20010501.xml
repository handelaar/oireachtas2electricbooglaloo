      <P>The number and grades of staff vacancies which exist in my Department at present are set out in the following schedule and are generally consistent with day to day variations arising from promotions, departures etc. Recruitment to fill posts in my Department is in line with the normal procedures that apply to the Civil Service. Staff are assigned by the Civil Service Commission and recruited through FÁS in the case of services officers, services attendants and cleaners. Internal promotions are effected in accordance with agreed procedures in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present my Department has a small number of requests with the Civil Service Commission for staff to fill posts at entry level and competitive promotion interviews are also ongoing in respect <Col N="2" /> of other vacancies. I am circulating with the official report, a table setting out the vacancies by grade in my Department.</P>

    <P>*The job sharer at AP level has recently decentralised to another Department.</P>
    <P>*Arises mainly from recent promotions to Assistant Principal.</P>
    <P>Note:</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to consolidate the posts of Secretary General of the Department and Secretary General to the Government, following the appointment of the current Secretary General to Secretary General of Foreign Affairs, and to create a new post of Second Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for Northern Ireland, EU and international affairs.</P>

    <P>Mr. Noonan: Is the Taoiseach aware that last March the CPSU, which represent 11,000 civil servants, voted by three to one to withdraw from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness because the pay of its members had fallen significantly behind that of other public servants? </P>
    <P>Will he confirm that the low pay for clerical grades is the main reason for the haemorrhage of staff from the Civil Service, which led to 1,794 vacancies, according to the Minister for Finance, when he answered the Parliamentary Question in this House last October?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: A recent survey on retention within the grades of both the civil and public services was undertaken by the Civil Service Commission. This survey was agreed by the SMI implementation group and it highlighted the areas where there was a difficulty in retaining staff. Numbers were fairly stable across all grades except in the clerical grades. There has been choice and opportunity in recent years for young people to move around and earn better salaries and wages. I am aware of the CPSU demand. Its case is part of the benchmarking process and should help that situation. In recent years because of the level of Civil Service pay rates and the better rates available elsewhere, the security and stability of public service employment has not had the attraction it once had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has accepted that the main haemorrhage is from the clerical grades and that the CPSU has correctly reflected that its members are going elsewhere because their pay is so low. What steps is the Taoiseach taking to ensure that the CPSU does not take the industrial action it has threatened? As the Taoiseach is aware, the clerical grades are absolutely essential to the working of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that. The clerical staff are highly respected across all Departments and none of us would be able to undertake our daily duties without them. This has been the case when they have undertaken industrial action in the past. The CPSU submitted its case in the benchmarking process and will compare that with the issue that has caused the problem. People have left the Civil Service not only to take up employment in the private sector but to work in other public sector areas where remuneration is higher. The CPSU has a case to put within the process. Everything that was agreed on 4 December, the PPF and the new taxation levels have all been of benefit to people in the lower grades. They will see the difference this month in their wages and salaries cheques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that one of the biggest difficulties facing any junior entrant into the Civil Service which is largely based in Dublin, is the impossibly high cost of <Col N="4" /> accommodation. What plans has the Taoiseach to address this issue? </P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach inform the House of the number of vacancies currently in the office of the Chief State Solicitor? We were told last month by way of a parliamentary reply that there were 40 vacancies. Will the Taoiseach confirm that those 40 vacancies in the Chief State Solicitor's office are having a serious impact on the administration of the State's business and the administration of the justice system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have those figures available today but I gave that information to the House quite recently during Question Time. There are a number of vacancies in the office of the Chief State Solicitor. An additional recruitment competition has been held which has helped to fill a great number of the vacant posts. The vacancies in the Department of the Taoiseach number about nine at the moment, and about three or four will be filled. I do not wish to either understate or overstate the problem in the clerical grades in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 40 vacancies in the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the posts in the office of the Chief State Solicitor are at solicitor level. Following negotiations which have been ongoing for the last year or year and a half, there has been a dramatic increase in staff numbers in the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office and the changes arising from the Nally report have been implemented. While it will take time, the posts will be filled. The offices are now working at a much higher level. When we conduct recruitment campaigns it would be nice if we could recruit staff, but at the level of the marketplace and the successful economy we cannot do what the private sector can do and pay the rate for the job regardless. All the rates and salary levels are linked and we have to stick to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Taoiseach is familiar with the proposal of the Commission on Public Service Pensions which recommends that retirement at 65 years of age should be compulsory for all public servants. He is, probably, aware also that this is opposed by many individual public servants and the trade unions which represent them. Does he consider that this would be an inappropriate time to reduce the retirement age for some civil servants when the Civil Service Commission is finding it difficult to fill certain specialist posts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always held the view &ndash; I dealt with this issue, as the Deputy will be aware, in 1993 &ndash; that a retirement age of 65 years is fair and I do not see an argument for changing it. In most European countries the debate is that it should be higher. Perhaps, it will also become an issue here. It is not at present. Most European <Col N="5" /> countries, including the Swedish Presidency, are arguing that it should not be reduced at European level. I do not see anything wrong with a retirement age of 65 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the staffing crisis in clerical grades in all Departments, will the Taoiseach confirm or deny that senior management within the Civil Service, including his own Department, is informing members of junior grades that they are entitled to claim family income supplement and that this particular mechanism is the only way through which people can be part and parcel of various Departments? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on family size. From the start family income supplement could have been paid to those on low salaries depending on family size. The same applies to clerical grades in the Civil Service. Let us not move away from the reality. If one looks back over the last 20 or 25 years, when times were good there was a flow of younger people from clerical and other grades. When times were a little harder there was no flow whatsoever. It is the attractions in the various sectors that give people the choice to move. In recent years they have had enormous choices. Some 300,000 jobs have been created and people saw opportunities to move.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin asked about prices. The only logical and useful way to help is by way of the issue of decentralisation, which has proved successful for those who have been able to move. It is not what everybody wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stopped it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Government which pressed decentralisation. A fortnight ago the Minister for Finance gave a detailed reply on the proposals he is examining on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disgraceful that those with families who act as clerical staff across Departments have to rely on family income supplement in times of prosperity. A further difficulty they are experiencing in the Civil Service is the total lack of child care facilities in Departments. What proposals does the Government have to provide crèches across Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Family income supplement has been made quite attractive by the improvements the Government has made and which have been beneficial to those availing of it. There is not any indication that more members of the Civil Service are applying for it than there were but it is more beneficial to them now. The number who would take it up would depend on the number of children. It is useful for some people and it is an attraction for them to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government dramatically increased the amount of money for child care facilities, particularly in the public service. We assist people providing facilities and, where possible, provide the <Col N="6" /> resources to provide more crèche places. I agree with this policy and substantial funds have been made available for it. In addition to providing crèche facilities, the Civil Service leads the way in facilitating career breaks, job sharing and pool arrangements for work and in implementing family friendly policies. These are increasingly utilised.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission is working to increase the attractiveness of the Civil Service through a range of measures which it announced recently. It held an exhibition to show the attractions of the Civil Service. We should not talk down the position. A career in the Civil Service is an attractive career which allows people to move through the career scales. The vast majority of people in the upper and middle ranks of the Civil Service joined the service at low levels. That has always been and will continue to be the case and it is the reason we should put it forward as an attractive career.</P>
    <P>There are some difficulties due to the success of the economy elsewhere but those issues are being addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Last October, the Minister for Finance informed the House that a total of 1,794 vacancies existed throughout the 15 Government Departments. Has that figure increased since October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the figure but in my Department the figure has been reduced significantly. There are a number of reasons for that. The Civil Service Commission has conducted additional competitions, which has assisted matters. It is also looking at other issues, such as retention levels. We did not do well over the years with regard to giving employees proper training and opportunities in their early years and it has been recommended that this should take place. We have not done that since the foundation of the State&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The vacancies have not increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number in my Department is nine and only about three of them are in clerical areas. I do not have the figures for the other Departments but the additional competitions held by the Civil Service Commission over the winter led to an improvement in the position in my Department so I presume that is happening elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I chaired a meeting of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board on Friday, 16 March in Washington. The meeting included a discussion on developments in both <Col N="7" /> the Irish and US economies, and on Ireland's strategy for research, development and innovation. I also took the opportunity to brief members on the peace process.</P>
      <P>Board meetings are normally arranged to coincide with visits by the Taoiseach to the United States. I currently plan to visit New York in early November and, subject to scheduling constraints, I hope to hold a further meeting of the board during that visit. I expect that a board meeting will be held, as is normally the case, over the St. Patrick's Day period next year.</P>
      <P>On an ongoing basis, the board constitutes an important resource upon which the Taoiseach can draw, as required. The Irish Embassy in Washington maintains regular contact with board members, and I may also have the opportunity to meet individual members if they are visiting Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent months there has been a series of down-sizing announcements by US companies which have significant operations in Ireland. They include Gateway, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard. Intel let a construction work force of 2,500 people go when it shelved its plans to develop another plant at Leixlip. Given these occurrences and the ongoing concern people have about job security in some American companies in Ireland, does the Taoiseach believe more regular meetings of the board should be convened so there would be some advance notice of the likely intentions of these companies? Is his Department in ongoing contact with members of the board outside the organised meetings to ensure there is an early warning system available to Departments on any adverse announcements that such companies are making or are likely to make as the American downturn continues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally one or two meetings a year take place, which is sufficient in a formal sense. Topics usually take a good part of a day to discuss. I can confirm that there is regular contact with my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A number of committee members also give of their time to come here fairly regularly, such as Brian Thompson, who chaired the discussions on the first telecommunications report, which was very successful. He is now working on the second report. Many of the committee members are involved in education and in their separate ways have built their own links and contacts, which are very useful. Whether times are good or bad, this has been built in the last decade and they liaise with us and feed information back. We appreciate this. Whether the news is good or bad, it is important that we receive forecasts and early warnings. Usually most of the individuals concerned come to Ireland during the summer and I always make time to meet them, either individually or as a group.</P>

      <P>I draw the Taoiseach's attention to a statement by the Minister for Finance on Friday, 20 April 2001. When speaking in Malmo, Sweden he said that he considered the views of Mr. Duisenberg, the Governor of the European Central Bank, to be simplistic if he thought that the euro zone could escape the effects of an American downturn. He went on to say that he believed that a sustained downturn in the United States would have an effect&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am stating that I am not quoting. I am using, as I always do, an <i>aide-memoire</i>. If the Chair wants to see the text, he will see that I am not quoting. I am drawing the Taoiseach's attention to a statement made by the Minister for Finance in Malmo, Sweden, where he criticised the Governor of the European Central Bank, saying that he thought the Governor's views simplistic and that he expected there would be a considerable adverse effect for the euro zone, including Ireland, from an American recession. Has the Taoiseach been briefed by the Minister for Finance on the effects of this? The Minister for Finance has strong views on the matter. What precisely are the adverse affects he is talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that it is not fair to take a line out of the full text of what the Minister for Finance said. The reality is that across technology and dot.com companies many of the announcements made since the beginning of the year were based on the results for the last quarter of last year in the United States when there was marginal growth and on the basis that worldwide operations, including Asia and Europe, have had percentage cuts in staff. There have been holes in many operations, which will have an impact on Europe, about which there is no doubt, though we hope it will not be as bad as some people say. <Col N="9" /> According to our Central Bank and OECD projections for this year, there will still be over 6% growth, three times the European average. That would be an enormous achievement in a year in which there has been a downturn or tightening in the United States. Any sensible person would see that is the position, but so far so good. We have experienced some difficulties, but they have not been as harsh as was indicated prior to Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not been affected as most companies will continue to spend much of their budgets on research. If anything, there has been an upturn in that area because of the amount of money that was put into Technology Foresight Ireland and into research. Luckily, the moves of recent years have enabled us to improve our position in an area which is relevant to the jobs and products of the future. There has not been any effect from the US slowdown.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 8 January 1998 the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, announced that he had asked officials to examine how best to encourage and facilitate an understanding of the Battle of the Boyne and an appreciation of the environment in which it took place. An interdepartmental committee, made up of representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of the Environment and Local Government as well as the Office of Public <Col N="10" /> Works and Bord Fáilte was established and held its first meeting on 12 March 1998.</P>
    <P>The mandate of the committee was to examine how best to develop the historic site of the Battle of the Boyne. The committee, which is chaired by a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs, has met on a regular basis for the past three years. My Department is represented on the committee at assistant principal level. Very importantly, the archivist of the Orange Order participated fully in meetings of the committee from an early date. Consultants have been appointed to carry out a planning study of the site. Advertisements were placed in newspapers, North and South, inviting individuals and groups to make submissions to the consultants regarding the study, the final draft of which will be completed shortly. The study will form the basis for the interdepartmental committee's recommendations to Government for the long-term development of the site.</P>
    <P>The condition of the site has been a concern for some time to Unionist and Protestant people and to organisations in Northern Ireland for whom the battle has a particular significance. In the context of consolidation of peace and reconciliation, as a cultural heritage and tourism project in its own right, and having become aware that the owners of the Oldbridge estate were interested in selling the property, the Office of Public Works was asked to explore the possible acquisition of part or all of the estate with a view to providing greatly improved visitor facilities. The estate forms a substantial part of the battle site and was offered to the State on commercial terms. A number of site visits were made to the estate by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, who is responsible for public works, by the chairman of the Office of Public Works and by members of my office.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement places a formal commitment on the Government &ldquo;to continue to take further steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland&rdquo;. Against this background, immediately after the establishment of the institutions on 2 December 1999, I announced on 5 December 1999 that the Government had agreed in principle to purchase the site of the Battle of the Boyne. The Office of Public Works negotiated the purchase of the Oldbridge estate for £7.85 million, a valuation which it considered fair. Funding for the purchase came from the Exchequer through the Vote for the Office of Public Works, following sanction by the Department of Finance. Neither I nor my officials played any part in the negotiations on the purchase of the site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think the purchase price of the site, £7.85 million, represented good value, considering the site had been bought for £2.7 million in December 1999? What is the Taoiseach's view on the reasons for an increase of 200% in the value of the land over two years? Was there an independent valuation of the site? <Col N="11" /> Does the Taoiseach accept that such an enormous profit in such a short time, accruing at the expense of the taxpayer, brings back uncomfortable memories of the saga of the Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the property market changed dramatically during the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Did it move by 200%?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works believes it got good value for the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works believes the site is very important. Commercially, the price represented value, as it could have cost an amount similar to the cost of other projects in the area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a great deal has been written about that site. It was approved for a golf course, it was also on the route of the new motorway and it was connected with many other issues. However, the Office of Public Works was quite satisfied with the price. It had examined the matter in great detail and believed it was a good deal and a good buy for the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach thinks so too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point. We do not like it when prices increase over a short period. However, that was the value arrived at and that was the advice on it. It would have been nice if it could have been cheaper but the Office of Public Works believes it got the site at a fair price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the independent valuation was being done and being considered by the interdepartmental committee, was the interdepartmental committee, that is, the committee on which, I presume, his Department was represented, aware that a close political associate of the Taoiseach is reported to have been involved and to have an interest in the firm which was selling the site and to have made a £250,000 profit on the deal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is represented on this committee by an assistant principal, but there were other people. This came out of the proposal of the Good Friday Agreement that we should look at heritage sites. The very first statement by the then Minister, Deputy Andrews, in the beginning of 1998 stated that the focus of the Government was on the creation of lasting peace through negotiation of a comprehensive political settlement but there were other initiatives we could take to assist in the promotion of reconciliation and mutual understanding and, as example <Col N="12" /> of this spirit, it was right for the Government to take steps to mark and celebrate the various aspects of our past and to recognise its traumas. It was on that basis that the site was purchased, and the fact that in the negotiations of the Good Friday Agreement a number of very high level and respected leaders of the Protestant Churches and community raised the issue of the Oldbridge estate and its condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the discussions were on that basis. While the negotiations were going on with the Office of Public Works, I was not aware of who owned the site. I was not involved in any of those details. I was not aware that a person who I know outside of politics was involved in it until the deal was concluded and that person at no time took any direct involvement in any of the discussions. The person involved is an individual who works closely with the McCann family who owned the site. Neither did the McCann family take a direct involvement in the negotiations. It was negotiated by their legal representatives.</P>
      <P>The one or two individuals in my Department who dealt with this issue were all people who worked on the Northern Ireland side of the issues and were looking at it as a peace and reconciliation issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not aware. It was not brought to their attention. Nor was there any connection or representations made to me nor assistance asked by the individual of me or any other contact. I assure the House of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of suggestions or statements have been made in the newspapers about this site. I am referring in particular to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 April this year. Will the Taoiseach tell us whether they are correct?</P>
      <P>The first suggestion is the Taoiseach pressed the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, on the point that this site should be developed. The second statement is that a friend and, to borrow Deputy Howlin's phrase, a close political associate of the Taoiseach was one of the beneficiaries who would have shared in the profit of £5 million which was made between the day of purchase and the day of sale of the site, and would have gained £250,000 from it. There is a third suggestion then, that this person was the third person present when the Taoiseach met Mr. Gilmartin. I am simply referring to an article on 18 April 2001, but I would ask the Taoiseach to tell us is this correct or is not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say the individual is a <Col N="13" /> friend of mine, to call him a close political friend would not be a correct interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was a trustee of the Taoiseach's constituency office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is not actively involved in politics, but was a trustee of the office 14 years ago. To answer Deputy Noonan's question, I said in the House that the person concerned was in my office in 1989 when Mr. Gilmartin was there. I stated here sometime ago that the person concerned was not at the meeting, but was in the office. As to the purpose for the use of the site, the initiative came from the Department of&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to my third question, did the Taoiseach request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to include the project in the Government's millennium programme? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The article states categorically that he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not. A grant of £500,000 was given towards the site which has not yet been taken up as the departmental committee has yet to agree how to make use of it. There would have been letters between my Department and one of my advisers who was involved directly in the Northern Ireland negotiations and among others pressed for this development and the development at Messines.</P>
      <P>The initiative came from the negotiating body of the Department of Foreign Affairs which was of the view that a fair case had been stated that the site should not be left in the state it was in and that something should be done about it. It was regularly stated to that body by Northern colleagues that if the Battle of the Boyne had gone the other way, it would have been a great memorial, like Gettysburg or Culloden. This was pressed hard by senior figures whom I do not want to name, but whose names are on record. They stated in the negotiations that something should be done about the site.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs established the committee on the day the Minister met some of the people concerned in Armagh. He stated that the issue should be looked at. The committee worked on it for almost two years during which it was indicated that it was considering various works. It was discussed at the committee that, perhaps, it should purchase a site. It was indicated by the owners that they understood that it was being examined and that they would be prepared to sell. The initiative came from the Department of Foreign Affairs and it was the subject of discussions. The decision was not made until the end of 1999, until the institutions were established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no interference whatsoever by anybody known to me. The person concerned never discussed the issue with me until the deal was <Col N="14" /> closed and I read about it in a newspaper. Neither would I have talked to the person concerned about any other deals or negotiations in which they were involved. Just because a person is known to me would hardly be a reason he or she could not continue with his or her commercial business.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the tribunal is examining the issue. It seems that is the only way one might obtain clearance or fair play. The tribunal will examine all aspects of the issue and will find that nothing I, the individual concerned or anyone else did was for anything other than a very good reason, to help relationships with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask three related questions. Can the Taoiseach confirm that less than two months after the previous owners acquired the site the then Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that it would be good if the site was acquired by the State? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that it represents good value for money to acquire a site for £7.85 million yielding a profit of more than £5 million in two years on an investment of this kind? Has the Flood tribunal requested files from the Taoiseach's Department and, if so, have they been handed over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question on the value for money aspect, I am aware of sites in this city that would not have been sold a few years ago. One particular site in the Docklands was sold for £9 million&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about agricultural land, not the docklands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was valued at about £1 million a few years earlier. There were many other proposals for the site, which was the reason importance was attached to it and we placed a value on it. I was not interested in it. I am not a valuer and I only concerned myself with the recommendation of the Office of Public Works, which stated the view that this was a fair value. On the second question, about the Minister's statement, the Deputy is incorrect in that regard. I understand that the site was sold in the summer or autumn of 1997. The Minister's first statement asked Department officials to examine, with the assistance of their colleagues in other Departments, ways in which this might best be done, so that detailed proposals could be considered by the Government at an early date. He particularly mentioned what had been done in the museum and he went on to say that further work would be done to preserve and interpret historic sites including, I believe, the site of the Battle of the Boyne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What date was that? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 8 January 1998, but he was not raising the purchase of the site at that stage. He issued the statement then because he had a <Col N="15" /> meeting in Armagh with very senior people who had made numerous complaints about the condition in which the site had been left and urged that the State should act to rectify the situation. The people in question have also spoken elsewhere about this issue and I have no doubt they will confirm their strong views on it if asked to do so. It was a long time afterwards that the legal representatives for the site contacted the Government and indicated an interest in selling it. Negotiations then commenced and were eventually completed in August 2000, but had not really been moving very quickly until December 1999. That was just a few days after we had completed the formal signing of the agreement setting up the institutions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's third question, early this year the Flood Tribunal asked for all of the papers in relation to this matter. The Secretary General of my Department and the officials involved, including one of my advisers who was involved in the Northern Ireland negotiations, have made statements giving all the details available and they will co-operate with the Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Taoiseach's previous reply that an adviser to the Taoiseach made representations on his behalf to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to have this project included in the Government's millennium programme? Is it also true that this associate or acquaintance of the Taoiseach is the same person whom he proposed for appointment to the inaugural board of Enterprise Ireland? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct and I hope the Deputy has no difficulty with that. I am not sure if the official in my Department dealing with this actually made representations in relation to the millennium programme, but certainly an official of my Department who is a key figure in the negotiations &ndash; not the same official who was on the interdepartmental committee &ndash; was strongly in favour of the development of this site. Indeed, all members of the negotiating team were equally in favour of it, regardless of what Department they were involved in, including officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the leader of the negotiating team who instigated the proposal. I do not wish to mention his name but he has made it quite clear that he is quite prepared to give the full history to anybody who is interested. My adviser and the senior official concerned and the negotiating team were in favour of the development of the site initially and when the opportunity to purchase it arose, they were also supportive of it.</P>

      <P>They have put forward submissions which will be taken into account and the final draft of the study will be completed and published shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>While official CSO figures for overseas visitor numbers and revenue earnings for this year are not yet available, I understand from Bord Fáilte that latest industry estimates put total losses in tourism earnings incurred through cancellations, and more particularly lost bookings since the onset of the foot and mouth crisis, at £225 million. This figure is made up of £175 million in respect of foreign earnings and £50 million in domestic business.</P>
      <P>Without taking into account the beneficial impact of the measures which I will outline later to address the adverse impact of FMD on the industry, potential losses of out-of-State tourism revenue in 2001 could, according to Bord Fáilte estimates, be as high as £500 million, with additional losses in domestic earnings of the order of £140 million depending on market conditions and performance for the remainder of the year. I understand the loss of tourism earnings from the North American market are projected at 18% for March to August, 2001 based on advance bookings to date compared to the same period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and I have been working <Col N="17" /> closely with Bord Fáilte and the Irish tourist industry confederation, ITIC, since the onset of the crisis to ameliorate the adverse impact on the tourism and hospitality industry. We have taken a range of measures to deal with the situation, including the following specific actions. We have encouraged the tourism and hospitality industry to support the national campaign to minimise the risks of a spread of FMD through the application of appropriate control measures and disinfectant procedures. These efforts have been publicly acknowledged as a mature and responsible act on the part of the industry for the greater common good. We have set up structured arrangements to ensure the views of the industry are taken on board, in particular when decisions are being made on the application and modification of FMD control measures. Myself and my Department are represented on the Government task force which has been convening daily, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to review measures to prevent the spread of the disease. In addition, a separate high level tourism action group, under the chairmanship of the chief executive of Bord Fáilte, and including key representatives of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and my Department, has been established to monitor the FMD situation on a continuous basis. This group has been meeting twice weekly to actively manage issues which are affecting tourism business already booked and limit any medium to long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects overseas.</P>
    <P>We have been pressing very strongly for a phased modification of the control measures and restrictions in so far as they affect tourism in line with the emerging risk situation. This action helped to bring about an easing of the restrictions on a range of events and activities in the tourism and sports areas in line with the advice of the technical expert group established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. For example, the deferred St. Patrick's Festival has now been rescheduled for the weekend of 18 May. We have sought the phased reopening of the key State cultural and heritage attractions to allow a full and varied array of facilities to be available to our visitors. The majority of these attractions are now being reopened by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Dúchas in line with advice from the technical expert group.</P>
    <P>We are arranging through the Bord Fáilte tourism Ireland website, the associated call centres and other websites to ensure that there is regularly updated information available to visitors and the trade about major attractions and events which are open. We are issuing a clear message that Ireland is open for tourism business and that subject to the taking of appropriate precautions, Ireland remains a welcoming destination for international visitors, including visitors from Britain. In his remarks to independent British travel agents at their annual conference in Killarney <Col N="18" /> last Friday, the Taoiseach made it abundantly clear that visitors were welcome and that Ireland was open for business.</P>
    <P>In line with the advice from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, intending visitors from foot and mouth disease infected countries, who had contact with susceptible animals, or agricultural land, or were in the control area, are discouraged.</P>
    <P>We are pressing for an easing of the restrictions on the movement of people within Ireland in line with the advice of technical expert group, particularly to help the accommodation sector. This includes strong advice to the commercial, business and the State sectors not to cancel or postpone seminars, conferences, meetings or training programmes. We are successfully securing the lifting of the ban on angling. Under the new guidelines, angling and sea angling, which does not involve access across certain agricultural land is permitted.</P>
    <P>We are appealing to the banks, the financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners to be as sympathetic as possible towards any tourism business which is experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties arising from the foot and mouth disease crisis. The Irish Bankers Federation, on 30 March, indicated they were committed to giving careful and sympathetic consideration to requests for support from those business customers with financial difficulties. The Department of Finance confirmed that, regarding individual businesses' cash flow problems, the Revenue Commissioners, as part of normal arrangements, will look sympathetically at payment arrangements on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>We are preparing and presenting a major tourism marketing reassurance campaign, the initial phase of which is under way with special media advertising in all key markets and we are preparing trade reassurance measures and promotional visits. Details of it, including the actions envisaged in key markets, are available directly from Bord Fáilte. The campaign has been designed in consultation with the industry. Last week, key representatives of two important groups, the American Society of Travel Agents and the Independent Travel Agents, were here. I have just returned from an intensive week long promotional visit to four US cities, during which I met trade representatives and gave many interviews. Such visits to other key markets in the near future are planned.</P>
    <P>These actions are incremental to the largest annual tourism marketing programme for 2001, involving expenditure by the tourism industry and Bord Fáilte of £100 million, of which approximately £35 million is Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>My Department and Bord Fáilte are keeping the situation under review in order to make further appropriate adjustments, in consultation with the industry, to planned marketing and promotional activities as matters evolve. Bord Fáilte is mounting an aggressive marketing campaign in our major markets aimed at maximising advance <Col N="19" /> bookings and confirmation for the coming peak season. Our shared objective is to ensure a good performance throughout 2001 and that no unnecessary medium to long-term damage is done to the tourism industry, which is so economically important.</P>
    <P>This industry dealt successfully with past crises, including the fallout from the Gulf War and the Northern Ireland troubles. It is resilient and strong, and with the help of the outlined measures, will overcome this current setback and meet the challenging average annual growth targets set under the national development plan.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister not accept that we have lost the PR battle in the United States? Since one million tourists come from the United States, the message sent out that they were not welcome for St. Patrick's Day, that the country was closed, that they should stay at home, is not retrievable. I see from editorials and other newspaper articles that the impression in the United States is that we have something akin to a nuclear holocaust, the birds are falling from the trees, we are locked in our homes, and that the disease affects human beings. It is impossible now to retrieve a most lucrative market, which filled beds, restaurants, pubs, lounges and buses. We have lost the PR battle and this leaves empty beds, lounges, pubs, buses and restaurants. Does he not accept that the figure he gives of a 15% to 18% drop is extremely conservative in view of the reality in the market place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <P>I disagree. The Deputy should think of what the situation would have been if we had foot and mouth disease. Not only would the agricultural and food industries be wiped out but tourism also. I agree with the restrictions imposed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the national effort to contain the disease. We won the battle. There was one case in the Republic and three in the North. We can give ourselves credit for what we achieved.</P>
      <P>The cancellation of the St. Patrick's Day festival sent a message across the world, particularly to the United States, that there was something wrong here, but, even with hindsight, the expert group agreed that bringing 1.5 million people on to Dublin's streets was inadvisable. Unfortunately, that was the message sent out.</P>
      <P>I returned from there yesterday and the picture is different. There is a greater awareness and understanding of what foot and mouth disease is. It is no longer on the television screens. We had 36 separate interviews in the audio-visual and print media. Numbers will be down in June, July and August but the autumn will be good, and next year will be a bumper one. There were many cancellations but others indicated that they want their deposits to be held until the autumn or next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the potential estimates of the worst <Col N="20" /> case scenario. A better message was sent to the United States and the losses will not be as high as indicated. I have a better, more confident picture from being in the United States.</P>

        <b>:</b> There was no threat from that million people because the disease is not there. There was no problem in inviting American tourists here, the majority of whom do not visit farms. There should have been a different marketing approach to the British market, which gives us 3.4 million people, and the United States, which gives us one million. Does the Minister accept that the mixed message led to the situation where &ndash; I hope I am wrong &ndash; there will be a greater drop in revenue from the United States than he predicts?</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte always had a substantial marketing budget. What is the additional budget to provide the extra dynamism to penetrate the American market and reverse false perceptions? What are the indications from Aer Lingus, the main carrier from the United States, on its market share drop, in March and April, for example? What is its prognosis for market development for the rest of the season?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The horrifying pictures of the pyres on Sky Television and CNN in the United States were a major factor. People from the United States were not ever at risk. I have heard the stories the Deputy mentioned, but we must attempt to recover. For the past month or more we were engaged in a salvage operation. The United States market may not be as bad as was anticipated.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and the industry required £10 million extra. We have £8 million, of which £2.7 million will be spent in the USA. Next week, a major television campaign starts fronted by Martin Sheen. Other Irish people have put their backs to the wheel also. Confidence in the USA is growing. The marketing campaign will be monitored and in two months, if required, an additional £2 million will be added, making up the £10 million.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is under pressure. Some estimates are that business might be down by 20%. I met Aer Lingus officials in the US who indicated they expect their figures will recover. Thankfully, they are offering very attractive flights in the US, some of which are $200 less than the normal cost. I saw advertisements in the newspapers for flights costing $569 from the west coast and for $299 from New York. Therefore, Aer Lingus is battling, and while its current estimate for loss of business is 20%, it hopes to recover that loss by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways. We had a fight on our hands in dealing with foot and mouth and have no regrets on how we handled it. There was <Col N="21" /> always a problem regarding the definition of the countryside. To people in the EU, the UK and the US, the countryside meant everywhere outside Dublin. I accept we had a problem getting the message across. It does not mean people cannot go to Letterkenny, Kilkenny, Carlow, Galway or any other such place. Rather we meant that people should not visit farms. Americans make up their own minds and are very health conscious. Many of them travel in the later part of their lives and are therefore more health conscious.</P>
    <P>I accept the horrifying pictures caused much damage, but we did our best to assure people we had no pyres here. I hope the message will get across. If the industry comes on board and provides attractive packages, as Aer Lingus is doing, much of the business can be salvaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be realistic in saying the foot and mouth scare has caused devastation in the tourism industry. Because it is just a blip on the economic horizon in Dublin does not mean it is just a blip in the rest of the country. Figures for my town show a decrease of about 50% in visitor numbers, which translates into a reduction of £150 million this year. If a business in this city lost that amount of money in one year all the stops would be pulled out. I understand some work has been done but we must have a dose of reality and accept that the industry is almost lost for this year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the American market, the booking rate of one major American tourism company is down from a normal 1,300 per week to 120 per week. Has the additional marketing money which has been put in place since last March resulted in an up-turn in the American and British markets? If not, what should we do? We must rescue the industry. The Minister opened a major hotel in Killarney last week, and I wonder how the owners will recoup the £4 million they spent from their own pockets. The county could lose about 1,500 jobs. It is very serious and we must treat it as such.</P>
      <P>Many proposals have been put to the Minister by the tourism industry and I ask him to treat the issue seriously and advise me of the benefit of the additional marketing funding and if there has been an overturn in cancellations. I think there has been no such overturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a large conference in Killarney last week and those who attended raved about the area, so I think we have already gone part of the way. We will not see the full result of the money which has been invested in marketing until later in the year. However, I am confident given the new message and the greater awareness in the US, the attractive packages being offered and advertised in newspapers and the additional £2.7 million being invested in the American market. We will take a hit in June, July and August, but I think we can recover towards the latter part of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have figures from all the different companies, <Col N="22" /> which are down by between 20% and 50%, depending on the sector. The coach touring business has been particularly badly affected. The tourism industry is worth between £3.5 billion and £4 billion to the economy and it is a success story that we have lost only between £200 million and £225 million. The tourism industry was fully behind the restrictions and precautions and fully played its part. It was always conscious there would be a loss. If we can restrict the loss to these figures, and hopefully see an upsurge towards the latter part of the year, we will not be doing too badly.</P>

      <Quest>the projected cost of all elements of the stadium-campus Ireland project at the latest date for which figures are available.</Quest>

      <P>The cost of the stadium outlined in the original PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study is £230 million. The study also gave an initial guideline cost of £51 million for a campus of sporting excellence. As I explained in the House on 31 January and again on 6 March last, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, which has responsibility for overseeing the planning and development of the project, on the basis of further work carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers and professional estimates of the cost of the commercial facilities planned, now estimates the cost of the campus excluding the stadium at £320 million, giving a total estimated cost of £550 million. Because CSID has decided to put the project to the market on a public private partnership type of approach, it estimates that the private sector will be prepared to invest £150 million in the project, mostly for the commercial facilities. When the private donation of £50 million is taken into account, the cost to the Exchequer of sports campus Ireland including stadium Ireland is estimated at £350 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has today decided that to assist it in determining final Exchequer allocations for stadium and sports campus Ireland, and the sensitivity of such allocations to variations in the scale of each element of the project, I will commission independent consultants to review the overall approach and contracting strategy adopted to date in securing the development of stadium and sports campus Ireland and associated infrastructure, with regard to risk identification, management processes and structures, timing and overall cost effectiveness; advise on CSID, the contract awarding authority's, considered assessment of the gross cost range and Exchequer funding requirements for each facility proposed for the campus emerging from the outline bid phase due for completion on 21 June, of the tendering process now under way; advise on CSID's assessment at the end of the outline bid process of operating costs and revenues likely to <Col N="23" /> be associated with stadium and sports campus Ireland and the likely net impact on the Exchequer; assess estimated costs of relocating existing facilities from the Abbotstown site arising directly from the decision to establish stadium and sports campus Ireland; assess the estimated costs of access infrastructure directly attributable to the development of sports campus Ireland; establish the extent and timing of the likely Exchequer liability associated with the above developments; ascertain the direct and indirect benefits from the developments outlined above, including the impact of physical development and access on the hinterland of Abbotstown and the Dublin region, including the positive impact of infrastructural development, and make recommendations to the Minister as appropriate in the context of the overall purpose of the review.</P>
    <P>The consultants will liaise with and be guided by a steering group to be established and will be required to deliver their report not later than three months after the date of commissioning.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on at last responding to a question I tabled recently and bringing in experts to look at the whole project and all its connotations. In terms of the figure of £550 million which the Minister has given, what provision is made for construction inflation, which ran at 12.5% last year, given that, according to the latest list from the Government, the stadium Ireland Bill will not be ready until the end of the year? The Minister has not so far addressed the question of whether the value of the site at Abbotstown is being factored in. If it is not, why not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the stadium will be in the region of £350 million. The Deputy is a man of reasonable intelligence and knows that one can arrive at the determinate cost of any project only when the tender documents arrive. They are expected on 21 June. They were to arrive on 31 May, but the bidders wanted an extra three weeks which we granted because of the delays caused by the debate about who would be in the stadium and so on. The documents will arrive on 21 June. Only then will we be able to estimate what the cost of the stadium will be. The cost of the millennium stadium in Cardiff was £171 million. The cost of this stadium is estimated at £230 million. Within this figure there is a £50 million contingency plan for various increases in price. The PricewaterhouseCoopers estimate we have was obtained approximately two years ago. I accept that there may be price increases. However, it seems not to be fully understood that 15 different consortia wanted to build the stadium. We are now down to six or, in reality, five. An international assessment board will assess the six existing projects and come up with three proposals which will be brought to Cabinet which will make a decision as to which will go ahead. There are <Col N="24" /> ten elements to the stadium, in addition to the stadium itself.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have funds directly at its disposal for supporting projects of this nature. I understand, however, Bord Fáilte has received an application for sponsorship under the international sports tourism fund for the World Road Cycling Championship proposed to take place in Killarney in 2004.</P>
      <P>An initial assessment and evaluation of the proposal has been made by Bord Fáilte and the sports tourism partnership advisory group. However, because of the significant level of financial support being sought by the promoters, the board of Bord Fáilte has decided that an independent cost benefit analysis of the proposal should be commissioned. I understand from Bord Fáilte that this analysis should be completed within the next three to four weeks and that a decision on the application will subsequently be taken by the board, taking into consideration any further advice from the advisory group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cost benefit to Killarney, to County Kerry, and surrounding areas, will be in the region of £26 million? An expenditure of about £2 million would be a worthy investment in the region, bearing in mind the losses sustained by the tourism industry in Killarney as a result of foot and mouth disease, and the knock-on effects that will have for the rest of the year. The Minister should be only too glad to give something back to the area by providing necessary funding for this major event.</P>
      <P>The Government has stated on a number of occasions that it wants to attract huge international sporting events. This is one of the reasons for building Stadium Ireland. This is an opportunity to improve the roads which does not involve great expense other than the provision of seed capital. It would be a major boost to the local economy and there would also be a very attractive pay-back to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This year I established a special <Col N="25" /> unit within Bord Fáilte for the purpose of attracting major international events, such as the World Road Cycling Championship, to Ireland on a multi-annual basis. That would mean that we would not have to pay out in any one year for an event. This event will take place in 2004. It fits perfectly into a scenario where the Government would commit a certain amount of funding each year in order to bring the event to Ireland. I agree with the Deputy that attracting large sporting international championships is what this is all about. Having the facilities to accommodate those in the future is also part of the Government's policy. This event will cost approximately £5 million. The promoters are looking for £2.7 million from the Government over the next few years. That is a substantial amount. The rest will be made up by Kerry County Council, commercial sponsorship and television broadcasting rights.</P>
      <P>There is a problem in that we have to make a decision by October 2001. I have no problem in principle with trying to attract events. These are the types of events I want to attract. Unfortunately, however, in recent years cycling has not been exactly playing ball. I refer to the drugs situation, and the Deputy is aware of my view on drugs in sport. As it is my number one priority, I, therefore, have reservations regarding this event. I understand, however, the UCI, the international body with responsibility for cycling, has been doing its utmost to combat drugs in this sport. It has decided at long last to introduce a test for EPO. While that is to be welcomed, I was very disappointed that, in the first few days of the Tour de France last year, three of the cyclists tested positive for drugs. I will, therefore, keep the matter under review and monitor the situation, particularly with regard to the major cycling events taking place in Europe this year &ndash; the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia and so on &ndash; because the same cyclists would be coming to the world championship in Killarney, and if drugs are involved, it would not benefit this country. I will monitor the situation throughout the summer. I am aware that the UCI has taken steps to try to limit drug use and I hope we will be in a position to back this event. I would love to be able to back it, but there is that bit of cloud which I hope we can overcome.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 to 56, inclusive, 58, 60, 63 to 67, inclusive, 69, 71, 74, 82, 91, 99, 562, 566 and 576 together.</P>
      <P>While official CSO figures for overseas visitor numbers and revenue earnings for the year to date are not yet available, I understand from Bord Fáilte that latest industry estimates put total losses in tourism earnings incurred through cancellations and, more particularly, lost bookings since the onset of the foot and mouth crisis at £225 million. As I said previously, this figure is made up of £175 million in foreign earnings and £50 million in domestic business.</P>
      <P>Without taking into account the beneficial impact of the measures I have outlined to address the adverse impact of foot and mouth disease on the industry, potential losses of out-of-State tourism revenue in 2001 could, according to Bord Fáilte, be as high as £500 million, with additional losses in domestic earnings of the order of £140 million, depending on market conditions and performance for the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>As yet, there are no estimates available as to how potential losses will impact on a regional basis. Information on the effects of the foot and mouth outbreak, both in Ireland and abroad, indicates that city based tourism is less affected, whereas rural areas, in particular those catering for activity segments such as walking and hiking, are particularly at risk. Another determinant of the regional impact in Ireland would be the extent to which the region is dependent on discretionary or leisure tourism, compared with business travel or other non-discretionary trips.</P>
      <P>As a result of the foot and mouth crisis, Bord Fáilte's target of 6.6 million overseas visitors for 2001 will be extremely difficult to achieve. I understand the chairman of Bord Fáilte has set as a current objective, which he sees as challenging, the achievement of a similar level of performance as last year.</P>
      <P>The Government target for tourism growth, as set out within the framework of the national development plan, is for an average annual increase of 5% in foreign exchange earnings over the period of the plan, 2000-06. Given that actual performance in year 2000 was ahead of target, there are no plans at this stage to revise this target.</P>
      <P>While I understand from Bord Fáilte that the level of potential losses which, if they materialise, could put up to 25,000 jobs at risk, the latest live register figures suggest that there has been no significant job losses to date in the tourism sector as a result of the foot and mouth situation. CERT's contacts with the industry also suggest that the level of permanent job losses to date is minimal, but that recruitment levels in the coming peak season could be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> My Department and I have been working closely with Bord Fáilte and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation since the onset of the crisis to ameliorate the adverse impact on the tourism and hospitality industry. Taking on board many of the suggestions made by the industry, we have taken a range of measures to deal with the situation. As I have outlined the ten measures in question, I presume there is no need to go over them again.</P>
    <P>My Department and Bord Fáilte are keeping the situation under close review with a view to making further appropriate adjustments, in consultation with the industry, to marketing and promotional activities planned for this year in line with the evolving situation. Our shared objective is to ensure no unnecessary medium to long-term damage is done to the tourism industry which is so important in economic terms.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, the tourism industry has dealt successfully with crises in the past, including the fall-out from the Gulf War and the Northern Ireland troubles. It is a resilient and strong industry. With the help of the measures I have outlined and through its own efforts, we can overcome this current temporary set-back and meet the challenging average annual growth targets we have set under the national development plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>)<b>:</b> As regards the projected redundancies or job losses, does the Minister accept that when Bord Fáilte, the expert in the field, estimates that the figure will be 25,000, one can take it as a reasonable estimate? Does the Minister accept that tourism is seasonal in nature and that we &ldquo;ain't seen nothing yet&rdquo;? The high tourism season is only beginning when the effects of the foot and mouth crisis will impact.</P>
      <P>As regards Question No. 54, has the Minister met the two companies in question, Aer Lingus and Irish Ferries? The reason I ask if he has met Aer Lingus is that it carries a substantial number of overseas visitors from the United States and Great Britain, in particular. Is the Minister aware that it informed our committee that the number of passengers from regional airports in Britain was down 18% and 10% from London? Is he aware that Irish Ferries carries 1.8 million passengers every year and 400,000 cars? Does he accept that, possibly, the best way to enable these companies to reclaim their losses, to retrieve the situation and salvage the ground lost is to give them marketing grants given that they have a track record, the know-how and credibility? They all fly the shamrock. Given that they have a marketing strategy and network in place, does the Minister accept that giving these companies direct funding would be a very positive step rather than give marketing grants exclusively to Bord Fáilte?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that method. Because he only took up his position recently, the Deputy may not be aware that last year I established the Tourism Marketing Partnership precisely to overcome that situation. The carriers, <Col N="30" /> Aer Lingus and Irish Ferries, were advertising and marketing on the one side and there was Exchequer funding on the other. There was a great deal of overlap. The two came together in what is known as the Tourism Marketing Partnership and agreed to pool their marketing resources and knowledge of marketing this country as a destination. I do not agree with the Deputy, it has not been sought by the marketing companies.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of Aer Lingus in the United States. I also met Mr. Tony Kelly from Irish Ferries. I agree with the Deputy that they estimate the figures will, certainly, be down this year. They are current figures, but I have indicated that I hope there will be an upsurge later in the year. I also agree with the Deputy that this is a seasonal industry and have accepted that we will take a hit in June, July and August as a result of the foot and mouth situation. The Deputy is not suggesting that we should have dealt with it any differently. Recently, the British farming journal commented on the method by which the Irish Government dealt with the situation. It said that it was flexible and supportive when necessary. There has been praise throughout Europe and the rest of the world for the way in which we have handled the matter. The tourism industry, unfortunately, has been involved. Can the Deputy imagine what would have happened to the industry if we had not dealt with the foot and mouth situation in this way? We would not have been talking about a seasonal situation, but a wipe-out for the year. The Deputy will be fully aware, as will the tourism industry, that market share is very difficult to claw back. We could have been clawing it back for the next four or five years. As a result of what we have achieved &ndash; we have successfully contained foot and mouth disease &ndash; we can look more positively towards the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on the Minister's comments, he will agree that rural tourism, in particular, will be adversely hit. It is an area of tourism that should receive some direct assistance. A promotional video is being made in west Kerry specifically for a television station in New York. It will have a huge audience. Funding has been collected but there is a shortage of £1,000, despite knocking on every door in County Kerry. This work is being done by rural people to save their businesses for this and next year. Matching funding should be made available by the Department, especially in the rural tourism sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is likely that the foot and mouth situation will be volatile for the rest of the year. We cannot become immersed in crisis and paralysis every time there is an outbreak. The Department must prepare strategies to ensure there are no further <Col N="31" /> outbreaks and to address occasional and more widespread ones should they arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that tourism is vital to her area. I will consider her request but it would be logistically impossible to give every sector that type of support. Everybody has been adversely affected by the foot and mouth situation but Exchequer funding has always been given to Bord Fáilte. In 1988 there were 800,000 visitors to the country. Given the funding provided to Bord Fáilte by successive Government to market Ireland as a destination, visitor numbers rose to 6.3 million last year. It is the body to which funds should be directed with a view to overcoming the current situation.</P>
      <P>The issue of crisis management will not recur. At the outset everybody across Europe was surprised at the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Today any five year old child knows what is involved. We have learned, especially from the expert group. Perhaps much of the initial advertising was unnecessary but we were dealing with a situation where nobody knew what should be done, other than to ensure the disease did not spread. We have learned, but unfortunately it was at some cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the economy lost £640 million with the possibility that 25,000 jobs in the tourism sector may be lost. What discussions has he had with the financial institutions with regard to providing relief for the tourism sector? What discussions have taken place between his Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the county managers on the question of rates remissions for businesses? Local authorities cannot act alone on this.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the total budget allocated in the current year for internal marketing within this country to encourage people to stay at home? Will he consider allocating some of that funding to the local marketing co-operatives to promote their packages? In view of the detrimental effect of foot and mouth diseases in the west, which is rural based, and in view of the rail dispute last summer which also damaged the economy, what measures have been taken in the Department of the Environment and Local Government to ensure the proposed blockage of the N5 for the June bank holiday weekend does not proceed as it would have a further negative impact on tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy could take up the N5 issue with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I will see what I can do. I and the Government pleaded with the financial institutions with regard to the foot and mouth situation and there was a positive response from them. They indicated they would consider matters on a case by case basis. I have indicated <Col N="32" /> the action they promised with regard to one sector.</P>
      <P>The issue of rates remissions is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Finance. I understand it would not be possible to proceed on that basis, nor is it required. However, it will be considered in the long-term depending on how the figures turn out. Additional funding of £10 million has been allocated. Of this £8 million has been confirmed and a further £2 million will be allocated if necessary in another two months. The funding is to be allocated among the main markets, including the domestic market. I also allocated an additional £150,000 to the County Louth area. I am sure the Deputies will agree that was required in view of the fact that restrictions there have been lifted only in the past two days.</P>

      <P>However, in the light of developments arising from the foot and mouth disease crisis, my Department raised the matter again with the Department of Finance on behalf of the CTTC. The current position is that the Minister for Finance has asked his Department to fully re-examine the issue, and I understand this re-examination is under way.

        <b>:</b> Would the Minister accept the immediacy and urgency of this matter given that a coach seat is a perishable product; if it is not used today, the loss cannot be retrieved tomorrow. A bus that cannot pay its way is a loss-maker to its owner. The bus-tour operators have invested more than £20 million this year in new buses and state-of-the-art equipment in order to provide more comfort for their passengers, and in most cases, these buses will now be empty. Will the Minister ask his colleague, the Minister for Finance, whether the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's answer to queries from Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, Deputy Naughten and myself were to the effect that while individual Ministers, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Finance, have individual responsibilities in their own spheres and Departments, he is responsible for the overall management of the tourism sector.

      <P>I have met the CTTC on a number of occasions and this was a matter that was discussed as a result of their pre-budget submission. There is an EU State aid problem here. The structures of excise duties on fuel oils have been harmonised at EU level under Directive 92/81 EEC. Article No. 8 of that directive allows member states to introduce certain reductions and exemptions from excise duties on fuel oils. Ireland is already using this provision successfully to grant a rebate for passenger services, and provide relief in other areas such as fuel for use in the manufacture of alumina for motor vehicles used for the disabled and so on.</P>

      <Col N="34" /> As a result of the situation arising from the foot and mouth disease problem not only here but in Europe, I hope it will be dealt with by the Minister for Finance, but I am not sure that it can be dealt with now.

This Judicial Conduct Bill is of tremendous importance.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I propose the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph (ii) of the arrangements proposed for taking No. 48, and substitute the following: The Bill shall thereupon be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, pursuant to Standing Order 112 (1) of the Standing Orders relative to public business, paragraph 1(<i>a</i>) (i) of that Committee's Orders of Reference; that it be an instruction to the select committee that it should not proceed to consider the Bill until the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights have (<i>a</i>) considered submissions in writing and (<i>b</i>) met in public to hear oral evidence on the Bill and report it thereon.</P>
      <P>We regard this as a very important matter. We believe the issues of last year arising from the Sheedy and O'Flaherty affair are not being dealt with in this Bill in a manner which allows allegations of misconduct against judges to be pursued satisfactorily. This Bill is being guillotined and rushed through the House without due debate. The recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution that a 90-day period should be allowed for consideration of constitutional amendments is being transgressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> The amendment proposes that rather than completing this by 1.30 p.m. tomorrow on Committee Stage in plenary session it should be teased out by the appropriate Select Committee of the House and that Select Committee should consider submissions in writing and should hear oral evidence. Issues as important as the procedures which should be invoked by this House against judges should not be galloped through the House as if they were matters of insignificance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has fundamental difficulties not only with the proposed legislation but with the manner in which it is being handled by the Government. We have no difficulty in supporting the amendment tabled to the Order of Business by the Fine Gael Party. I hope it will be amplified to include consideration by the justice committee of the promised legislation to bring into effect the judicial conduct council that is to be established under the proposed constitutional amendment. It is an established fact that where there is legislation to establish any body subsequent to a constitutional amendment, for example, in relation to the divorce referendum and the bail referendum, that legislation would be published in advance of the completion of the Bill to take the constitutional amendment in this House so that people know exactly the terms under which the constitutional amendment will be implemented. In this case, a judicial council is to be established, which, under the terms of the referendum would have very limited functions, that is, to make recommendations and findings. Contrary to the repeated statements of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it would not be able to take actions or to discipline anybody. We need to see the legislative measures that will govern the operation of the judicial council. This is a fundamental matter of constitutional importance. It should not be guillotined and rushed through this House. If it is persisted with, we will rue the day when at some date in the future we will have to deal with another matter of judicial accountability.</P>
      <P>I ask you, Sir, to assist us in another matter. I understand two proposals are being taken together under No. 2, that is (i) and (ii). I ask you, Sir, to rule in relation to (ii) on whether it is acceptable to set tomorrow's business on the assumption that a vote to be taken at 10 p.m. tonight will be passed? How can we make arrangements for the Committee Stage of a Bill before the conclusion of Second Stage and the views of the House are determined? I ask you, Sir, to answer that question. I appeal to the Taoiseach to give the space and the time for a proper ventilation of this most serious matter &ndash; the judicial accountability procedure to be put in place and enshrined in the Constitution.</P>

I ask the Government Chief Whip to reconsider his approach because tomorrow we have only one hour for Committee and Report Stages of the Bill to deal with the Nice Treaty, which is an important treaty. He is exposing himself to ridicule. The people will consider that this is being rushed through, that he does not want debate on these issues and that is why these referenda are being held simultaneously.

      <P>I will. This is not Question Time. That was earlier and it is finished. There is the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill which is already before the House. I presume that is one of the Bills about which the Deputy asked. For the information of the House, in his closing speech the Minister will indicate the amendments which will be moved on Committee Stage tomorrow. He will also give an outline of the legislation he is preparing to set up the body provided for in the proposed constitutional amendment. The Minister has listened, as has the Government, to proposals put forward by Members who took part in the debate. I have read the full text of what Members have said and we have tried to take those views into account. This outline will include a proposed composition of the body, its functions and its relationship with other elements of the court structure.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to the amendment I have moved. Does the Taoiseach realise that the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill has had in whipping terms only one round of speakers, one slot for each party? On an issue which concerns a change in the Constitution, to say that we have sufficient debating time when there has only been one speaking slot per party is a travesty of language. There are fundamental differences in principle with our approach and with the approach proposed by the Government in this Bill and we have not sufficient time to tease those out. We want that time on Committee Stage. If any measure less than impeachment were to be taken against the judge the procedure invoked in the Bill to do that needs to be underpinned by legislation. The legislation has not yet been produced.</P>
      <P>We are being asked to sign a blank cheque today on Second Stage and on Committee Stage. We should proceed in an orderly fashion in accordance with precedent in this House over several years, that legislation on Committee Stage would be referred to the appropriate committee so that the expertise of this House could scrutinise the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill and so that the Government would be given time, while evidence is being taken in Committee, to produce the Bill which is actually the substantive proposal which would underpin the bulk of allegations of misbehaviour against judges where sanctions would fall far short of impeachment. That is the problem. I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider my amendment and, in the interests of the success of the forthcoming referenda, to take my views on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the indication from the Government that it will table amendments to its published proposals. Will the Taoiseach pay the Opposition the courtesy of circulating those amendments before the House embarks on the balance of the Second Stage debate, if it is intended to change the substance of the proposals on Committee Stage tomorrow? If the Government proceeds with the proposals as they currently stand, the Labour Party will trenchantly oppose a referendum to have them enshrined in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware of the widespread concern about the high incidence of various forms of cancer. The incidence is higher than the European average. Most forms of cancer are capable of being treated and cured if treatment starts in time. The Taoiseach is also aware that some cancers are terminal, particularly if treatment is interrupted or unavailable. Does he agree that it is an absolute disgrace that life-saving cancer treatment has had to be discontinued for the first time in the history of the health services? Such services have been discontinued for a number of patients in the Mater Hospital and other hospitals.</P>
      <P>The consultant oncological posts that were announced by the Minister for Health and Children have not been sanctioned by the Department of Finance and have not been agreed by the Government. The Minister engages in public relations under the guise of improving the health service. When will the Taoiseach do something about the crisis in our hospitals? People who have been told by their consultants that they will die if they do not receive on-going chemotherapy have been refused this necessary treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to support the importance and urgency of ensuring there is a comprehensive oncology service. Will the Taoiseach indicate when a nation wide mammography service will be put in place? It has been proven that breast cancer can be detected and cured with proper screening. Does the new health plan provide for similar screening for testicular cancer, which kills more men than any other cancer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the launch of the national cancer initiative about five years ago, £60 million has been spent on cancer treatment services. The money has been allocated to health agencies to enable the commencement of care treatment of cancer, in line with the national strategy which has been followed diligently. Allocated funding has resulted in oncology, haematology and histopathology appointments in hospitals, and has been used for palliative care. Areas for further development have been identified by regional directors, who have made changes in the strategy for providing cancer services through health agencies. Advances have been made in the provision of radiotherapy, dedicated and specialist cancer nurses, specialist surgery, palliative care services and cancer drug units.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Howlin's question, the Minister, along with the health boards and regional health authorities, has extended the programme on a nation wide basis as far as possible. Although there have been difficulties in certain areas, the Minister for Health and Children has tried to make the programme a success. Deputy Noonan referred to services provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which is the statutory responsible body. I have been informed by the Department of Health and Children that a small number of patients' chemotherapy treatment was cancelled recently due to the extreme pressure on beds. The authority made arrangements for these patients to have their treatment in the Mater private hospital. The situation is being continually monitored to ensure that appropriate arrangements are put in place to provide rapid access to chemotherapy services for those that need them. The Government will continue to increase enormously funding to the health service.</P>

For the first time, patients have been denied life-saving chemotherapy treatment in the Mater Hospital during the past three weeks. If an enormous furore had not been created in the media, the patients would not have been given services in the Mater private hospital, three weeks late. I put it to the Taoiseach that he cannot plead ignorance in this case as the Mater Hospital is in his constituency. He was once employed there and is fully familiar with the situation. Is he not ashamed of himself? This Government has money coming out of its ears for its pet projects but it cannot make the necessary management arrangements so that those dying of cancer get <Col N="47" /> the services necessary to save their lives.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liomsa labhairt ar an ábhar seo, ceann de cheathrar a bheidh ag dul os comhair an phobail go luath. Aon uair a bhíonn athrú Bunreachta á chur os comhair an phobail is ceart dúinn labhairt ar an ábhar sin agus ár gcuid dtuairimí a chur trasna.</P>
      <P>The Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill gives us an opportunity to look at the rights which are in the Constitution. One of the rights which were enshrined in the 1937 Constitution is the unenumerated right to fair procedures. The State is obliged to ensure the existence and effective implementation of a constitutional scheme of fair procedures and that is included, unenumerated, in Article 40. Inherent in that scheme must be an effective system to address and rectify any wrongs that have been done. In this regard, the State is obliged to ensure, not just that wrongs are righted, but that perceived wrongs are addressed and seen to be addressed. Such established wrongs must be seen to be addressed in a proportional manner. Corrective action or punishment which is excessive or unwarranted, would also offend the constitutional requirement of fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing constitutional structure is deficient in that it does not readily provide a proportionate remedy for persons who feel that a constitutionally appointed judge has behaved improperly. The power to remove a judge from office for stated misbehaviour is reserved, by Article 35 (4), to the Dáil and Seanad. It is proper that such a severe sanction be reserved to the elected representatives of the people. However, it follows that methods of checking perceived judicial misconduct should be reserved to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Indeed there are sound constitutional reasons why this should not be so. The doctrine of separation of powers, which has been referred to with approval in many decisions of the <Col N="58" /> Supreme Court and on many occasions in this House, have served the State well. Its implementation ensures the existence of an independent judiciary. It also ensures that the executive powers of government are carried out only by those who are elected by the people. It ensures that the Government, which exercises executive power, is answerable to the Dáil, which is answerable to the people.</P>
    <P>The courts have no role in the governmental exercise of executive power, save for one important exception. The Constitution is a document, not of the courts or the Oireachtas, but of the people. The powers of government must be exercised in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution and, if they are not, the courts are entitled to intervene on behalf of the people. Chief Justice Fitzgerald, delivering judgment in Boland vs An Taoiseach in 1974, explicitly recognised that this was so when he stated: &ldquo;The courts have no power, either express or implied, to supervise or interfere with the exercise by the Government of its executive functions, unless the circumstances are such as to amount to a clear disregard by the Government of the powers and duties conferred upon it by the Constitution. The political task of levying taxes, determining priorities and apportioning public funds, is a task for the Government, which must discharge those duties in accordance with Article 28 (4), which states (1) that the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann and (2) the Government shall meet and act as a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by members of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our scheme of constitutional government requires that the executive functions of government are carried out by individual Departments of State and it also requires that the Government remains collectively responsible. In relation to issues of policy, individual Ministers are not answerable to the courts. In relation to the administration of justice, individual judges are not answerable to the Oireachtas. We must ensure that whatever changes are brought about, they do not do violence to this constitutional separation of functions.</P>
    <P>The existence of a doctrine of separation of powers is not a reason to do nothing on the issue of potential judicial misconduct. It is, however, a reason to exercise significant caution. For members of this House to seek to take on the role of examining or criticising the day-to-day conduct of individual judges, save in the exceptional circumstances envisaged by Article 35 (4), would be just as wrong as it would be for individual judges to seek to take to themselves a supervisory role in relation to the exercise of the executive functions of government, save in the exceptional circumstances set forth by Chief Justice Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>Such constitutional changes as the people may decide to bring about in relation to the judiciary, must be cautious and limited. They must be sufficiently broad to bridge the existing lacuna and <Col N="59" /> sufficiently limited so as not to give rise to any inappropriate interference with judicial independence. The proposals introduced by the Minister meet those requirements. They permit facilitating those who have grievances, real or apparent, in relation to judicial conduct a means of addressing their grievance in a proportionate manner which will not improperly interfere with judicial independence. There is a measure calculated to increase rather than diminish respect for judges in the discharge of their constitutional duty. It should not be seen as a crank's charter, an extra constitutional court of appeal or a fetter on legitimate judicial independence. It is a measure which is appropriate and necessary.</P>
    <P>The measures which the Minister has suggested in this Bill, involve two major proposals. Article 35 (4), allows for the establishment of a body to investigate, or cause to be investigated, possible misbehaviour by, or incapacity of, persons while holding the office of judge. The new Article 35 (5) is a new provision for removing a judge for stated misbehaviour. There is a need for change to enhance public confidence in the judiciary and to support the independence of judges. This need has been recognised by a number of different groups, including constitutional review group of 1996, the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution and the committee on judicial conduct and ethics.</P>
    <P>The new judicial council to investigate complaints of misbehaviour and incapacity, can make reports and recommendations. This is an appropriate forum in which to deal with such complaints. At present, there is no forum to deal with complaints other than those which would warrant a judge being removed from office. We have seen various circumstances and various occasions where people have expressed disquiet and have felt that some form of investigative complaints procedure should be put in place in relation to actions by judges. Bearing in mind what I have said about the separation of powers, this judicial council would mean that judicial independence would still be guaranteed, because the investigation would be carried out by a judge or by a group of people, the majority of whom would be judges. It is important that judicial accountability should arise out of sanctions which are not, in their nature, legal sanctions but are in fact moral sanctions. The provision to remove a judge from office is, of course, already in the Constitution, by decision of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Such a decision might be made by one Government or, indeed, by one party with a simple majority.</P>
    <P>It is right since we are putting other procedures in place that we should strengthen the procedure by which we can remove a judge from office. It is also noteworthy that the role of the courts is changing so much that giving better security of tenure to judges of the lower courts will also allow for the impeachment of judges of those courts. Their roles are changing as are their substantial responsibilities and the extra work which <Col N="60" /> is being put upon them by the Courts and Court Officers Bill. The change in the Constitution will protect them and will also protect the separation of powers. By putting this proposal before the people I believe that they are willing to accept that the judicial council is necessary, that it will guarantee the separation of powers and judicial accountability. It will also protect their independence and will ensure that both the Executive and the Judiciary are more accountable to the people. Tá mé lán cinnte go mbeidh an pobal sásta an athrú seo a ghlacadh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Judiciary plays a pivotal role in the operation of democracy in this State under Bunreacht na hÉireann. Since the foundation of the State the impartial, independent and fair manner in which the justice system has been run by our judges, from District to Supreme Court, has served to maintain, strengthen and deepen our democracy.</P>
      <P>In a republican democracy such as Ireland's, the trust and confidence of the public enjoyed by the Judiciary is vital life-blood for the operation of our court system. The citizens of a republic can justifiably expect to lead fulfilling lives in the knowledge that they are protected by a democratic core principle &ndash; that the rule of law is applied in an even-handed way and that all are equal before the law. Anything that threatens to erode that trust or weaken our confidence in that principle is a threat to one of the foundation stones of our democracy.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, events of the recent past have done just that. Misconduct by a minority of members of the Judiciary has had a damaging and corrosive effect on confidence in the judicial system. It is essential that neither wealth nor connections influence, or are perceived to influence, judicial decisions. It is crucial that the Judiciary behave in a manner that is above reproach and that there be in place proper mechanisms to investigate and adjudicate on allegations of judicial misconduct.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the Sheedy affair, it is widely recognised that there is a need to reform the existing constitutional provisions relating to judicial impeachment and to replace them with more elaborate and detailed provisions. A need was also identified for new mechanisms to deal with allegations of judicial misconduct, the nature of which should not require resorting to the nuclear option of impeachment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new constitutional provisions in the Bill, which are intended to address these issues, are fundamentally flawed. Those flaws were identified and dealt with by Deputy Shatter, Fine Gael's Justice spokesperson, in this Chamber on 10 April. A body is to be established to investigate allegations of judicial misbehaviour or incapacity. While the new proposed article states that the body shall include judges and one or more persons who are not judges or former judges, it does not state the number of judges who will be a member of such body, who is to select the <Col N="61" /> judges to be appointed, how long a judge is to serve, who is eligible for appointment who is not a judge or former judge, how many persons who are not judges are to be appointed, whether lawyers other than judges are to be appointed, whether lay people are to be appointed, how long the non-judicial appointees are to serve on the body and who is to appoint them.</P>
    <P>This new body is empowered &ldquo;to make and publish findings and recommendations on allegations investigated by it&rdquo;. When first announcing this legislation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that this new body would be empowered to reprimand members of the Judiciary who are found to have misbehaved. However, no constitutional authority to reprimand is contained in the article published by the Minister. The provisions concerning this body do not detail how its power to investigate allegations of judicial misbehaviour or incapacity is to interact with, and affect, the power of impeachment conferred on the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This new article provides for the enactment of legislation to give effect to the provisions concerning the establishment of this body. Presumably, this will address some of the unanswered questions detailed by me. It is unsatisfactory that the Government should require the Dáil to complete its deliberations on this new provision without giving Members an opportunity to consider in detail the draft Bill the Government proposes to enact should a majority vote in favour of constitutional change. It is outrageous that people should be asked in a referendum to sign a political blank cheque authorising the Government to enact whatever legislation it wishes without the detail of that legislation being properly prescribed and constrained by constitutional provision. This measure should not be considered further and no vote should be taken on it in this House without the Government first publishing the draft legislation it proposes to enact. The Taoiseach may feel comfortable with signing blank cheques but the Fine Gael Party will not sign any blank cheque for this Government. I believe that as a consequence of the Sheedy and O'Flaherty affairs, the people, rightly, do not trust the Government when addressing issues relating to the Judiciary. Fine Gael will urge the electorate to vote against this flawed change in the law.</P>
    <P>The reforms required concerning the impeachment procedures of the Houses of the Oireachtas must be such as to ensure that, should it prove necessary to invoke the impeachment process, it is seen to work both fairly and efficiently. The reforms proposed by this Government, if enacted, will create new obstacles to the use of this fundamentally important constitutional mechanism and render it practically redundant. At present, on the vote of the majority of Members of this House, the impeachment process can commence. If a serious allegation of judicial misconduct needs to be addressed, there is no valid constitutional reason to require that the motion tabled calling <Col N="62" /> on the House to investigate this allegation be signed by 30 or more Members. If a majority of the Members of either the Seanad or the Dáil vote for an allegation of judicial misconduct to be investigated, such a vote should be sufficient for an investigation to commence and the judge whose conduct is being investigated should be suspended from judicial functions until such investigation is completed.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal that two-thirds of the Members of this House or of the Seanad must vote in favour of such an investigation before one can take place is ill-conceived and clearly intended to provide Fianna Fáil with an automatic political veto in this House on the use of the impeachment process to address allegations of judicial misconduct. It should not require the vote of two-thirds of the Members to suspend a judge under investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has failed to provide a single convincing argument in favour of the fundamental constitutional changes proposed by him. The motives of the Government in attempting to rush this measure with undue haste through the Dáil this week should be treated with the greatest suspicion. Fine Gael will call on the people to vote no to prevent the Government from putting in place a measure that erects a barrier to the impeachment of judges that is a constitutional version of the Berlin Wall. It is wrong to hold the referendum on the proposal concerned with judicial misconduct on the same day as the referendum on the Nice Treaty. By doing so, the Nice Treaty could become an innocent casualty of a referendum battle over a fundamentally flawed proposal on judicial misconduct.</P>

      <P>The Bill just published by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform contains two important proposals on the Judiciary. The first relates to the impeachment of judges for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and the second to the establishment of a judicial council which, among other things, would provide disciplinary measures for lesser forms of judicial misconduct. They are the two principal features of this legislation. Before discussing them, it is important to record the tremendous contribution which judges and the Judiciary made to the operation of our system of Government since the foundation of the State in 1922, something no Opposition speaker mentioned. It is disappointing to realise that the Leader of the Opposition is playing politics with this important asset of the State. The party which established the Judiciary and laid down its foundation in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, has reduced itself, through Deputies Shatter and Noonan, to engaging in a crude exercise in party politics concerning the proposal to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals deserve greater respect than has been given to them by the Opposition who elevated points made on Committee Stage, some valid and worthy of consideration, to points of <Col N="63" /> principle. It is not behaving in a responsible manner.</P>
    <P>The judges put forward their views on reform. The Minister did not agree with them. He went further and acted in broad accordance with an all-party committee report. The Opposition parties resiled from what they agreed to then. It is their right, under the terms of reference, to disagree with the conclusions. The Opposition was convinced of the reasonableness of these proposals in the all-party committee. However, since their introduction it has persistently sought to play politics with the issue.</P>

      <P>In the context of the Deputy's contribution, he might explain how the all-party committee's recommendation that issues of impeachment be dealt with by a majority vote of the House, can be reconciled with the Minister's proposals that it requires a two-thirds vote of the House even to investigate an allegation of judicial misconduct.</P>

      <P>The point of principle is that there is substantial reform of the current procedures envisaged in this legislation. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution was founded on foot of a review group established by Deputy Bruton. It did a detailed analysis and Deputy Bruton secured the agreement of all the party leaders to establish a committee to look at the review group. The Taoiseach, as leader of Fianna Fáil, agreed to participate in this and renewed it on the formation of the present Government.</P>
      <P>This is the first proposal from the All-Party committee. There is little point in having an all-party Committee on the Constitution if the Opposition take that kind of approach to constitutional change.</P>

      <P>I will not waste the House's time dealing with the bizarre character of Deputy Shatter's contribution. A proposal was brought forward by the Minister, in accordance with the broad spirit of the committee's recommendation. The Opposition seeks in this debate to raise political hares. That is disappointing especially in a party such as Deputy Shatter has the honour to represent, which always had respect for the Judiciary and judges and talks about the institutions of State. We have a duty in this House to secure and improve those institutions.</P>
      <P>The Government should not proceed with this proposal if all-party agreement is not forthcoming. I am sceptical of it, and urge the Government not to proceed given the spirit of the Opposition's approach. We should not have a referendum to reform and improve the Constitution&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;if the Opposition is not prepared to examine any reform proposals constructively.</P>
      <P>If we do not have this constitutional reform of the Judiciary it will be because of the Opposition's attitude in the debate. The independence of the Judiciary, and the people's respect for it, is not something to be cast aside for specious barrack room lawyering by the Opposition. We should not have a referendum or a popular debate on the subject if it is not prepared to be constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter requested me to deal with the committee's recommendation on what proportion of the membership of the Houses should consider this question. This was that the appropriate majority was of the total membership of each House, both in referring the charge and the impeachment. The committee also recommended, with no objection from Deputy Shatter's <Col N="65" /> party, that 30 Members should sign the necessary notice of motion, despite the objection to this made by the Deputy in his contribution. He said that the committee did not reason that conclusion. It did reason it because they felt that the procedure which applied to the President should also apply to judges of the High and Supreme Courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister took a different view on the necessary quantum of the majority to either prefer a charge or impeach a judge. It is an argument that can be pursued in a balanced way. The Minister will make announcements this evening to address the points raised in the debate.</P>
    <P>The crucial question for Deputies Shatter and Howlin is that this debate is too important to let it go off the rails on a party political witch hunt. The issues of principle should be distinguished from those of detail. The principle of establishing a judicial council with a lay element to investigate allegations or matters of dispute about judges' conduct is agreed by all parties. The issue of principle that the impeachment provision should be revised did not stem from the review group but because, following the Sheedy affair, the Ceann Comhairle wrote to the party leaders about it. The committee looked at it and reached a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The matters of detail raised by the Opposition are for Committee Stage and should not form the basis of the kind of contribution made by Deputy Noonan when he said that he would urge the people to vote no because of what he read to date. If that is the Opposition's approach to constitutional reform, the people will not entrust it with the mantle of Government in the next general election. It is wholly irresponsible to a part of our Constitution which Mr. de Valera drafted with extreme precision, elegance and ability. Further changes should be contemplated only with great caution. The Minister did this. The Minister has introduced certain modest proposals for the improvement of current arrangements. We have been subjected to a deluge of partisan abuse from Opposition parties who do not really care about the institution of the Judiciary. That is the only conclusion a reasonable person who has followed the debate to date could draw from the tenor of the contribution of some Opposition speakers. Of course, we know why that political line has been taken by the Opposition, namely, because there was a grave controversy in relation to the Judiciary during the current Dáil, and because the Opposition wants to milk it to the best of its political ability. I understand that, but there should be a disinterested look at this important issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, mentioned the separation of powers and the various considerations which apply. It is clear that the Houses of the Oireachtas or those we appoint as Ministers cannot be given any detailed role in relation to the scrutiny of judicial behaviour as that would wholly infringe the principle of the separation of powers. It is an important principle <Col N="66" /> in our system of Government and any discussion we have in the House must take account of it.</P>
    <P>The advantage of the revised impeachment procedure proposed by the Minister is very clear. There is a clear division of function between both Houses of the Oireachtas, there is a clear distinction between the charge and the hearing, there is a requirement that a minimum number of Members initiate the charge and there is a clear recognition of the right of the charged party to appear and be represented at the hearing of the charge. These were taken from the report of the committee in which Deputy Shatter's party participated. I accept his party is entitled to resile from that view and express what view it wishes.</P>
    <P>The committee believed that a simple majority of the total membership should suffice to remove a judge from office. The current voting arrangement permits a majority of the Members present and voting to remove a judge. The requirement that a simple majority of the total membership so vote precludes abstention and compels Members to exercise their responsibility in what is a very serious constitutional question.</P>
    <P>A crucial issue arises under this legislation as to how the circumstances surrounding a possible impeachment are to be investigated. The adoption of the presidential procedure would mean that one House would prefer the charge and the other would investigate it. The investigating House would be empowered by way of an alternative to cause the charge to be investigated. The committee believed the House investigating the charge should have the pivotal role of directing what inquiry should take place. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in the amendment which changes the impeachment procedure, follows in broad outline, certainly for the purposes of Second Stage, the views of the all-party committee.</P>
    <P>In considering less serious misconduct it is important to distinguish judicial decisions made by a judge in court and the behaviour of a judge. Judicial decision making, which is the core concern in relation to the independence of judges, is subject to an appeal system of the courts themselves, a system which is wholly open. The issue of misconduct can be dealt with separately. The various committees which have examined this question have recommended that a judicial council should be established with the capacity to impose moral rather than legal sanctions. The reason the various committees came to that view is that a judge must be personally independent in the exercise of his or her functions and cannot be forced to subject himself or herself to a collective public opinion, either of his colleagues or this House, in arriving at decisions. That is at the core of the issue regarding the separation of powers and is why we must be very careful while protecting and refining the ultimate option of impeachment not to invent sanctions which would create a climate where judges would be subject to pressure in arriving at their decisions. That is one of the great dangers in imposing real legal sanctions <Col N="67" /> short of impeachment. The individual personal responsibility of the judge, which is at the heart of the common law system and to which every judge on entering office must publicly subscribe, must be observed by every judge in the conduct of his or her office and be transacted in open court. We had the regrettable controversy which has given rise to so much of this difficulty because matters were not transacted in open court.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Opposition, perhaps on a less partisan note, to be careful to ensure the preservation of that core principle, namely, that the judge has a personal responsibility, quite apart from any collective system established by the Judiciary with lay participation, and quite apart from the ultimate sanction which this House must have, which is part of the constitutional balance we must preserve. This is not something which should be lightly set aside, but something about which we must be very careful. I appeal to the Opposition to address the substance of the legislation in this context. This Bill is too important for party politicking. It is easy for a Government speaker to urge that point on the Opposition, but I repeat that if the proposals before the House do not command support from the Opposition parties, the Government will have to look again at putting them before the people.</P>
    <P>This is a valuable and important reform, and if it is to be set aside because of barrack room lawyering on the other side of the House, so be it, but let not Fianna Fáil be accused of not being prepared to take on progressive constitutional reform on this issue, to explain to the people what is afoot and to put a rational proposal before them. As a party in Government we have no fear of doing that. It is for the Opposition to decide whether it will persist in the attitude it has displayed to date or address the serious issues raised by the controversy referred to in the Sheedy case, in the letter which the Ceann Comhairle wrote to the party leaders, in the various committees presided over by Justice Denham which have produced such admirable reports and in the report of the all-party committee. These issues have been discussed at length. We are dealing with a very sensitive balance between the institutions of State and are trying to draw a line between the responsibility of the judge, of judges collectively and of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government. We must be careful in these matters and look at them in the spirit in which the founding fathers of the State would wish.</P>
    <P>When Dáil Éireann was set up in 1919 it was not afraid to establish its own courts in opposition to the imperial courts which then exercised jurisdiction in the country. The republicans were never afraid of establishing our own legal system, and this is another step in the establishment of a legal system which belongs to the people and which dispenses justice in an independent and impartial way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I agree with Deputy <Col N="68" /> Lenihan's dissertation. It is not true to say the Opposition, for purely political reasons, wishes to undertake a witch hunt. Everybody is anxious to respond to the situation which developed over the past couple of years and to try to avoid a repetition. It is in the interest of all parties in the House, and of the House itself, that such an event does not recur.</P>
      <P>Reference has already been made to the separation of powers, which is important. I have no legal training, but we should try to superimpose the proposed legislation on the situations which have developed over the past couple of years to see how it works.</P>
      <P>There is a worry on this side of the House that under the proposal before us the House could find itself in a worse position and have its hands tied to an even greater extent then previously. Lest I appear to suggest that the House should interfere in the courts in relation to the separation of powers, we must revisit that issue as often as possible to clearly define where the responsibility of each begins and ends. In the past the House has tended to stray into the judicial area. However, the reverse has also happened on more than one occasion. We should have due respect for the institutions of the State, but the institutions of the State should have respect for the Houses of Parliament because the Houses of Parliament are the driving force in all such situations. They are not always right but they try to be in so far as they can.</P>
      <P>In politics, there is always a tendency for the Opposition to seize the initiative at the expense of the Government and <i>vice versa</i>. That is the political system we have, and it has worked reasonably well over many years. In countries that have replaced that system with a different system things have not worked so well. This situation comes down eventually to the whole question of the separation of powers. In the context of this legislation, I can think of another incident and other cases which I will not detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We argue among ourselves about where accountability begins and ends in this House. That will become much more important. Almost 90% of institutions set up by the State are accountable to a Minister, but the Minister is not accountable to the House. The late Brian Lenihan used to call them quangos and he fought against them all his life. He was absolutely right to do that because whenever a Minister is not accountable to the House it has no control, and the result is tribunals of inquiry to inquire into how certain situations were dealt with. We are the Houses of Parliament and it is ridiculous that we have to plead and beg to inquire into people's activities. I am not referring to any one situation. There have been scores over the years. Every week I table questions in this House on different matters only to be told that the Minister has no responsibility to the House in regard to them. To whom are Ministers accountable? They dictate policy, that policy gets the imprimatur of the <Col N="69" /> Houses of Parliament and, ultimately, Ministers must provide the necessary funding to allow the body in question to exist. It is most peculiar that various quangos that are paid for out of the State coffers are virtually autonomous, are not accountable to the House but are accountable to the Minister, but not in relation to the day-to-day running of their affairs. That is unacceptable. During my time in this House &ndash; there are people who have been here a lot longer than I have &ndash; I have seen the creation of many bodies of that nature and it is frightening because on each occasion we have handed over more and more powers.</P>
    <P>The same thing is happening at European level. Autonomous bodies are now accorded greater respect and there is greater decorum in dealing with them than with Members of Parliament, and Members of Parliament are pushed into a situation where they become cannon fodder. When decisions are taken that are perceived not to be in the public interest, public anger is vented on parliamentarians, be they national or European, and not on the body which made the decision. The perception is that the parliamentarians approved the budget that provided the facilities for the body to do whatever it wanted to do and that, therefore, parliamentarians are responsible if the body does something wrong. Occasionally the Minister is blamed but, generally speaking, Parliament is blamed because the Minister is supposedly accountable to Parliament.</P>
    <P>We need to be extremely careful here. I listened to the debates on the monitor and I agree with much of what has been said on both sides of the House. Apart from scoring political points &ndash; that is par for the course and if politicians did not do that here they would not be doing their job &ndash; there has been a clear theme running through the speeches, and that is the concern at the erosion of parliamentary powers, the handing over of power and authority to bodies which have no right to them.</P>
    <P>Are we improving the situation here or just papering over the cracks? We must ask ourselves whether more radical reform than this proposal anticipates is necessary? I have the greatest of respect for the legal profession and the Judiciary. We sometimes make pseudo-legal speeches in this House, and the Judiciary is not above making the odd political statement. That has been par for the course over the years and one can find ample evidence of it in the newspapers, but it is not a bad thing. A little bit of movement is healthy enough except where one side usurps the authority of the other.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the most recent event to which Deputy Lenihan referred. I feel sorry for the main players and the victims. What can start quite simply may suddenly become far bigger than was ever anticipated and people on both sides of the line can fall very fast. Such a situation can accelerate and take on a life of its own. A minor controversy can suddenly become so great that both sides are affected in a detrimental way by it. One of the players in that controversy indicated <Col N="70" /> that he wanted, and probably did at the time, to come before a committee of the House to explain, but having considered it, withdrew his offer at a later stage, I suppose for very good reasons. One thing that will have to happen eventually in regard to this House is that if somebody offers or is asked to come before a committee of the House they will have to do so. Otherwise the House will have to review its powers for the future. If it does not, there is a grave danger that the House will be treated with a certain amount of contempt. If that were to happen it would create many serious problems down the road.</P>
    <P>It is said cynically that politicians do not have the highest standing in the eyes of the public. It follows that the Houses of Parliament do not have a great standing either. However, the same would probably be found to be true if one examined any other trade and profession. In the present climate there is need for a recognition that, whatever else, warts and all, Parliament deserves a certain amount of respect, but Parliament itself must do its business in an upright and honourable way to command that respect. This fledgling State was able to do that and did it for a very long time. It is still doing it. The danger is in departing from that and going for the quick line, for quick publicity and, in doing that, running into difficulty and falling foul of somebody outside. There will always be a danger in the quick line of publicity in that we will fall foul of somebody outside and will run into difficulty.</P>
    <P>I refer to this proposal in relation to impeachment. When I was first elected to this House I remember talking to colleagues about a judge who had said something particularly obnoxious about politicians generally &ndash; this is going back quite a number of years. Some Members of the House were upset but other Members, with somewhat longer experience, were not so upset and took a totally different line on the issue. They said that if the guy was so full of his own importance, he should come and tell us face to face and that they would give him an opportunity to do so. That was confrontation. The theory was that the judge in that situation was asking for it, but we do not know. As it happened, it did not turn out in that way, but it was heading in that direction. Such a situation could arise in the future. The question of impeachment, as dealt with in this or the previous proposal, is an option to which one should not resort readily because it brings the two institutions into conflict. Bringing them into conflict in that fashion presents a grave danger.</P>
    <P>The people's decision must always be respected and they will make that decision based on the information put before them. It is up to us on both sides of the House to present that information in the most palatable and digestible fashion possible and, hopefully, the right decision will be reached. In the final analysis, it boils down to one issue. We, in this House, need to preserve the integrity and standing of the House while at the same time have respect for other State insti<Col N="71" /> tutions which, along with this House and the Executive, deliver and provide for the State generally in the area of public administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Understandably, much of the focus in the debate to date has been on the issue of judicial removal and impeachment. Given the need for a very rigid arrangement if an impeachment issue is to come to pass, it is understandable that the focus should be thus. I want to focus, however, on the second issue which is touched on and which has been largely neglected in the debate. I want to touch on the issue of judicial misbehaviour, incapacity and incompetence. The minor tragedies acted out in the name of Ireland in our courts daily are, frankly, of more concern to me than the magisterial issues raised in the Sheedy case.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Who judges the judges, who guards the guardians&rdquo;, the old question put by Juvenal, the Roman poet, is as valid today as when the question was posed 2,000 years ago. The question is particularly relevant in Ireland where the judicial class has been elevated to a status which is almost mystic. In fact, it is interesting that I used a quotation from Juvenal because the only experience I have of reading of a class so elevated was in books about the Caesars &ndash; they were untouchable. The reality is that the judges, our Judiciary, our courts and our courts system are as frail and as capable of incompetence, as capable of mistake and error as any other frail human institution.</P>
      <P>There is, however, I suggest to the House, very clear and disconcerting evidence of periodic &ndash; indeed, I would go further and say almost episodic &ndash; lapses in the Irish Judiciary. We have remained blind, or we have chosen to remain blind, to those lapses. We have chosen to ignore the lapses of a class which we regard as sacrosanct and untouchable. In recent years, there have been quite extraordinary and disgraceful examples of cases where there have been undue delays in reaching and issuing judgments. Justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done and must be done with a relative degree of expedience. That is not always the case in our courts and it certainly is not always the case in the senior courts in this land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two such cases are currently the subject of complaint about Ireland to the European Court of Human Rights. The propensity of some judges to hold on to cases for protracted periods is well known among the Judiciary, in the Law Library and in this and in the other House but we have all chosen to ignore that reality. In the Flattery case, for example, which is now complete so I can mention it, a dying woman petitioned one of the most senior members of the Judiciary to resolve her case, hand down the judgment and release her estate and the patrimony to her children before she died. Her appeals, her entreaties, fell on deaf ears. Justice in that case was not just blind but was pathologically deaf. The judgment was only issued after Mrs. Flattery passed away. It has <Col N="72" /> since gone to the European Court of Human Rights and I believe the State will be making a settlement.</P>
    <P>That case should never have happened; it should not have been tolerated. It was well known in the Law Library and in some sectors of the media which were fearful to comment for fear that they would have found themselves in difficulties with the court. It was known in this House and it reflects very badly on the Judiciary, on this House, on the other House and, indeed on the media that nobody cried halt in that case. A dying woman wrote to a judge explaining her position and simply asked that a judgment, which was two or three years delayed, be handed down. It would not happen in a Third World country. When something similar happened with a High Court judge in the United Kingdom a number of years ago, he was invited to depart from the bench after 18 months. We have no such arrangement in this State.</P>
    <P>The Doran case, described in the <i>Bar Review </i>as the little house of horrors, which has been resolved and which I can mention here, was an example of the judicial system, rather than vindicating the rights of a family, virtually crushing the family. I sat in the High Court and the Supreme Court during the hearing of that case. A combination of extraordinary incompetence and tardiness which should not be accepted in a junior court, which would not be accepted in the administrative structures of this State and which can reasonably be described as breathtaking, marked the painful and pathetic progress of that case through the High Court. It took so long for that judgment to be written &ndash; the case lasted for only a matter of days &ndash; that two Attorneys General expressed their personal concerns. The usual devices to try to persuade the judge to extricate his papers were engaged, all to no avail.</P>
    <P>A ray of hope, a ray of light, in that case was the extraordinarily clear and unequivocal judgment unanimously handed down subsequently by the Supreme Court totally and absolutely vindicating the family and finding the High Court judgment deficient in each and every regard that was challenged. I will not mention the High Court case that followed later in the matter of compensation and costs; the less said about that one, the better. However, the facts of that case are such that they clearly illustrate the need for a council to examine the behaviour of a court and a council to intervene where a case has clearly lost its way; not to interfere with the judge in the exercise of his judicial responsibility but to ensure that there is competent administration in the court. At present there is no institutional arrangement in operation in this State to properly intervene and discharge that responsibility. That is an oversight which I have highlighted in several debates here and in the Seanad. It is one of the reasons I am pleased the Minister is taking this action. One of the reasons I hope the matter does not become clouded by partisan debate or point <Col N="73" /> scoring is that reform in this area is so desperately needed.</P>
    <P>The Doran case is again before the Court of Human Rights. Regrettably, official Ireland is showing no more compassion or even common sense than was shown when the case was before the courts where it was mislaid on a judge's bench. Some of the submissions to the Court of Human Rights I have seen are shameful. They are as unrepresentative of the views of this House or of the people, if the facts were known, than the original activities in the case. Official Ireland, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, has recklessly misrepresented the facts of the case and is again placing a huge burden on the family which has already been put through the mill by the High Court and by extraordinary delays. It is not willing to accept the injustices done but has instead invested considerable ingenuity and public funds in muddying the water and trying to defend the indefensible.</P>
    <P>Judicial delay is not the only injustice the people suffer. I am pleased Deputy Shatter is present because he could bear me out on this. The behaviour of a small minority of judges, especially in the <i>in camera</i> courts, is a cause of grave concern. In recent years there have been disconcerting reports and complaints of harassment, bullying and discourtesy by judges in these courts. They are well known. One man on the Bench in Dublin would not be tolerated anywhere else.</P>

Members of the legal profession find themselves impotent before them.</P>
      <P>There is a lacuna and a problem with a small minority of judges that has not been addressed by the State and will not be until these procedures are implemented. Members of the Judiciary are as aware of the problems as members of the legal profession, people who sit in the courts and as I am. Their long-standing silence is not to their credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the utmost respect for Ms Justice Denham. She has done remarkable work but her <Col N="74" /> review of this area is disappointing. The Keane committee is weak. I do not accept the suggestion that there should not be any lay people on the judicial council nor the proposal that it should be formed entirely of judges. The suggestion that a complaint would go before a three person panel only after it had been passed by the disciplinary committee of the judicial council, only one of whose three members would be a lay person, is deficient. These proposals are to be put to the people and they will want to see a robust arrangement in place.</P>
    <P>There is a need to establish a council to oversee judicial conduct and those occasions where judges have been &ldquo;burnt out&rdquo; because of the traumas with which they must deal on an almost daily basis. They are human and frail like the rest of us. There is also a need to deal with occasional cases of gross incompetence. Such a council would help to maintain the credibility of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Any arbitration mechanism or review machinery put in place must not only be independent but accepted by the supplicants as independent and approachable. If and when appointed, the committee on judicial conduct and ethics must be seen to not just represent a vested interest judging itself. The judicial class is no more capable of judging itself than the political class or any other vested interest.</P>
    <P>Some of the arguments put forward are extraordinary. I have no difficulty with the idea of a special majority if a judge is to be removed. Judges must be put in place and defended to the highest possible extent. They should not be irremovable but their removal is an onerous issue that should require far more than a simple political majority of Members whipped through this or the other House. I have no difficulty with the proposal to extend this degree of protection to all judges at all levels. Once we give them this special provision and these special conditions it is not unreasonable that a judicial council to oversee the issue of judicial performance and behaviour should be strongly representative of the public.  It would be wrong to be able to second-guess judges but a clear distinction is to be drawn between a judge interpreting the law and behaving in a way that is administratively incompetent or unacceptable in terms of the way in which people are handled or the consideration afforded them. I hope that the proposals will become law and that they will reflect the points raised in this debate. I also hope there will be far greater representation of lay persons than is suggested.</P>

      <P>Despite Deputy Brian Lenihan's criticisms of the Opposition, the Government's approach to this referendum has been flawed, illustrated by the Minister's intention to propose amendments. Despite this, we expect the public to respond positively to these proposals in approximately five weeks. That is no way to approach a referendum or a topic the importance <Col N="75" /> of which has been well illustrated by Deputies Lenihan and Roche.</P>
      <P>The role of the Judiciary and public respect for it is a key element of our democracy. When that respect is shaken, as it was last year, it has huge repercussions for the balance between the Judiciary and our work. It is extraordinary that the Minister's amendment contains so little detail. How can we ask the public to agree to it when so much of the detail is outstanding, amendments are to be introduced later tonight a few weeks before the referendum is to be held, there is a guillotine on this debate and when one and a half hours is allocated to Committee Stage which is to be taken tomorrow?</P>
      <P>If this issue is of such importance to the Government, why is it approaching it in this manner? Why is more information not being given to the public and why has more time not been given to consider these serious issues? The all-party Committee on the Constitution recommended that 90 days should elapse from the publication of the details of a referendum to the holding of a vote. We do not have that amount of time in this instance. Why is that if this is such a serious issue?</P>
      <P>The flaw lies with the Government. It is not on the Opposition side for questioning the approach. Deputy Shatter has put on the record of the House in great detail some of the concerns which we in Fine Gael have about the approach that is being adopted. Indeed, last year in our document on democratic reform, democratic revolution as we called it, which was published last summer, and when in government we committed ourselves to the formation of a judicial board with a substantial remit to address a broad range of issues that affect the Judiciary and impact on the public. We also proposed the enactment of legislation containing new provisions for impeachment and for the imposition of lesser penalties and disciplinary procedures where appropriate. We feel that the Government has inadequately considered this in the proposed legislation, that there is inadequate detail and that some of the provisions are deeply flawed. We will be calling for a no vote, not because of any motivation attributed to us by Deputy Lenihan but because the issue is so important and because it should be referred to a committee where there should be public hearings.</P>
      <P>This legislation should be referred to the justice committee. We should be asking interested groups and individuals to make submissions and recommendations to that committee. There should be public hearings, there should be detailed work on Committee Stage in the justice committee to tease out these important issues. It should then be put to the people. Clearly, all this cannot be done in a matter of weeks. It is wrong to approach a serious issue like this in such a manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new provisions proposed to be included in a new Article 35.4 of the Constitution provide for the establishment of a &ldquo;body&rdquo; to investigate alle<Col N="76" /> gations of misbehaviour or incapacity of members of the Judiciary while holding the office of judge. While the Government's Referendum Bill provides that membership of this body shall include judges or one or more persons who are not judges or former judges, it does not state how many members of the Judiciary are to form this body, who is to be responsible for appointing members of the Judiciary to this body, who is to be responsible for appointing one or more persons who are not judges and what factors will render a judge or other person eligible for appointment to the body.</P>
    <P>These are very serious questions and we have not been given any answers yet. I was delighted to hear Deputy Roche raise the very same questions and say that he is unhappy with the sketchy proposals which the Government is outlining at the moment. He said that he would have serious questions, given the situation he outlined, about the approach being taken.</P>
    <P>Neither is it clear, from what we are being told, how long a member of the Judiciary or a non-judicial person will hold such membership. It is clear that there is a whole series of questions. In that case, why should the public support this amendment when so little is known about how the body will work? How can we ask the public to support this referendum when we do not have answers as to how this proposed body will work? Has the legislation not yet been prepared by the Government? If that is so, why is this the approach to such a serious issue? We should see legislation that will answer these questions.</P>
    <P>The new Article 35.4, while envisaging investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct which occurred during the time a person held the office of judge, excludes from its remit allegations of misbehaviour by a judge prior to his or her appointment to the Judiciary, even where such misbehaviour would clearly render a person unsuitable to continue in office as a judge. This is another aspect which is not examined in any way. It is envisaged from what is published here that this body would constitutionally be empowered to make and publish findings and recommendations, but there is no constitutional provision to enable it to reprimand a judge who has misbehaved where such reprimand would be appropriate due to the nature of the misbehaviour and where impeachment would be too severe a remedy. In this, the new proposed Article 35.4 varies from a recommendation contained in the report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics, published in December 2000, which stated that powers to reprimand should be conferred on any new judicial disciplinary body established. Why is that provision missing from what the Government is proposing? The committee also proposed the establishment by statute of a judicial council with substantially broader powers than those being constitutionally conferred on the body envisaged in the Referendum Bill.</P>
    <P>There are very serious questions that have not been answered by the Government, yet the <Col N="77" /> Government comes into this House tonight with amendments, late in the evening, intends to hold a referendum in a few weeks and hopes for full support for this Bill. We would not be doing our duty if we failed to raise the questions posed by Deputy Shatter at an early stage and if we did not raise them in this House this evening. It is not reasonable to expect the public to support this referendum, given the state of current information being supplied.</P>
    <P>Article 35.5 which the same Referendum Bill envisages being included in the Constitution, deals with the power of the Houses of the Oireachtas to impeach a member of the Judiciary for stated misbehaviour or incapacity. Under the current constitutional provisions, a member of the Judiciary can be removed from office for stated misbehaviour or incapacity by resolutions passed by a majority vote in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. Under the new provisions, a charge that a member of the Judiciary is unfit to continue in office due to alleged stated misbehaviour or incapacity cannot even be considered by either House of the Oireachtas unless a resolution is passed by not less than two thirds of the total membership of either House calling for such allegation to be investigated.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes very strongly that instead of facilitating investigation by a House of the Oireachtas of alleged judicial misbehaviour or incapacity, this proposal would create an unnecessary barrier to the commencement of any such investigation. I do not believe that members of the public or Members of this House would regard this as a good proposal.</P>
    <P>If a serious allegation is made against a member of the Judiciary, which a majority of Members of either House believe should be investigated, the public interest demands that such investigation should occur. There is no reasonable argument that, in order for an investigation to be conducted, there should be a vote supported by two thirds of the Members of either House. The reality is that if a majority of the Members, short of two thirds, vote for such investigation, the position of the member of the Judiciary concerned would become untenable, but the impeachment investigation could not take place. This is not the way to approach this issue. We are totally opposed to the provision and believe that a resolution supported by a simple majority of the House should be sufficient to commence an impeachment investigation.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Government's approach and the detail of the provisions outlined to date are flawed. As they are presented at present, they would not merit the support of the public. That is not the way to deal with this important matter. We call on the Government to publish detailed legislation so that the public know precisely what they are voting for.</P>

      <P>What is interesting about this debate is that it can be taken against a backdrop of demand from the public for higher stan<Col N="78" /> dards both in the actions of the courts and of politicians. That debate has raged throughout the country, particularly in relation to politics. There has been a demand for greater accountability of Members of this House. The electorate is aware of the need for scrutiny at all levels of State activities, be it within the political structure or the judicial structure. There is also an awareness that the divide between the judicial system and the political system must be maintained at all costs. That stance has much merit and has served the Judiciary and the political system for many years. However, there is a need for regular reviews of how we conduct our business and how the Judiciary conducts its business. We have a view which should be expressed and we have a role to play in articulating the views put to us by the public.</P>
      <P>There is a demand to modernise the functions of the courts. During the course of this debate there was mention of the Sheedy case, the O'Flaherty case and other cases. When this matter was discussed at the justice committee there was an open and frank debate on the issues. We had before us the procedure already in place to have these matters debated and comments to be made by members of the committee. We had the mechanism to discuss with the relevant parties the issues concerned. Despite the fact that the issues were spelled out and that the procedure was in place for any member of the committee, or any grouping on that committee, to come before the House to ask for the appropriate powers to deal with the situation, that did not happen. I am of the opinion that the Opposition opposed on that day for the sake of opposition on that issue. If it was sincere about its convictions and what it was trying to achieve it would have brought the matter to the floor of the House. In a sense, what we have here on the difference of opinion on the issue is somewhat similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is asking for a yes vote and the Opposition, as far as I can see from the Order of Business today and the comments made outside the House, is picking minor issues in this amendment and trying to cause controversy. It is a valid amendment and is required by the public. It is a response to the current day situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the judicial system, the modern system in which we should be operating, the demands of that system on the judges and the demands for accountability and greater scrutiny in the affairs of the State, be it judicial or political. There is an onus on us to correct the situation and to bring within the remit of the Dáil or Seanad the power to impeach and to create the judicial council to deal with minor matters other than impeachment and, perhaps, matters that we or the judicial council would wish to deal with in the context of some reprimand for the judges or a comment on the actions they may or may not have taken. This amendment moves towards that position and gives to this House, on foot of the judicial council, the right to comment on or to debate the <Col N="79" /> impeachment of a judge. It extends that right to all judges within the system.</P>
    <P>That is a sensible move and the two thirds majority relative to impeachment removes the possibility of a Government &ndash; a coalition or single party Government with a majority &ndash; forcing through a decision on impeachment or on the Judiciary. It also ensures that the proper debate takes place. It ensures the rights of the Judiciary even on the debate on an impeachment issue and it does not give a strong hand to any Government, or any political grouping in this House, to remove a judge at a whim or without much grounds for removal. Within that there is protection for judges, I am sure there is a right of hearing and a two thirds majority of this House or the Seanad has to be acquired before a judge is removed. It caters for any political situation that may arise.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the comment by Deputy Howlin who stated that a simple majority would be sufficient. That would be totally out of line with what we are trying to achieve and would not do anything for either the political system or the judicial system. Establishing the two thirds majority protects the judge or judges concerned and the judicial system and keeps at arm's length the Judiciary as opposed to the political system. That is something that is demanded of our political system by the public. It is essential that that division is maintained.</P>
    <P>The judicial council will deal with minor issues that may arise and make recommendations on the sanctions it wishes to have imposed relative to any particular breach of best practice within the judicial system. That is the way it should be. In his contribution the Minister dealt with this issue in great detail. The other issues about which the public is concerned are impeachment and the division of powers. Another matter about which there is concern is consistency in sentencing &ndash; while it is not dealt with in this Bill it will be dealt with in future legislation &ndash; and consistency in regard to the general comments of the Judiciary relative to many aspects of political life. The public would like greater consistency within the workings of the Judiciary in sentencing and in the attitude of judges towards the political system, as we have in our attitude towards the Judiciary. That is demanded and will have to be looked at in legislation in the future. There must be a focus on how we handle the judicial system and our prisons.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to the people who receive sentences from various judges as well. Any future legislation will have to take account of what is happening in modern Ireland and what our response should be to it. There is an argument that we are simply putting people away and are not dealing with the long-term position of prisoners within the system. That strays somewhat from the content of this amendment but I am anxious to underline the environment in which we are working and the demand for change <Col N="80" /> that is being debated by the general public. At some stage we will return to this issue and discuss what will be required in this area.</P>
    <P>The amendment deals with the power to impose sanctions. Impeachment is the ultimate sanction and it requires a two-thirds majority of the House. Other sanctions can be imposed in relation to minor offences. It is most important that we keep this issue at arms' length and that the function is kept away from the political system. Under the amendment there is room for the judicial council to deal with these issues and to make the recommendations required in regard to minor acts of misbehaviour. The council will have powers to deal with a wide range of incidents which might be described as misbehaviour. These recommendations will be capable of being published.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the number of amendments and lack of information. There is sufficient information on this issue in the various reports that have been commissioned from time to time with regard to judicial recommendations and the behaviour of the Judiciary. This is a response to the demand of the general public for a method of sanctioning judges. The House has also had an extensive debate on the issue. The demand from the Opposition is that we refer this amendment to a committee which would tease it out over a long time. There would then be a 90 day period before the question is put to the electorate. That would be dragging our heels on the issue.</P>
    <P>Over the past year and a half there has been a demand for serious and immediate action to be taken. It is a complex area in which we must maintain the rights of the Judiciary as well as the rights of politicians. We have no wish to see the edges blurred between the two groups. The debate that has unfolded in the House has been worthwhile. The issues have been covered in the time allotted by the Government to deal with them. There has been substantial debate on the issue, both public comment and a certain level of debate among political groups within and outside the House. The questions raised are legitimate but they have been answered. The amendments that will be tabled by the Minister will deal further with the issues that have arisen since the commencement of the debate.</P>
    <P>Members underestimate the willingness of the electorate to engage in what is happening. People are aware of the level of debate taking place and of the positions taken by the political parties. They are well informed of the issues relating to this amendment. I do not believe a prolonged debate which would involve a 90 day delay before the matter is put to the electorate would serve in any shape or form. We have done our business publicly and well. The information to be given to the public on this issue will inform people further. They are comfortable with the debate so far and understand it.</P>
    <P>Another point raised during this debate was the number of amendments being dealt with on the same day. I believe we have not gauged the <Col N="81" /> electorate as we should. People are quite capable of understanding the complexity of the different issues raised. They have informed themselves on them. Substantial correspondence was sent to each voter in today's post. Anybody who wishes to be well informed before casting his or her vote is given every opportunity to access and understand the information. The reporting of this issue and the comments of senior political figures of all parties, whether they are for or against the amendments, are also a source of information which is beneficial to the overall debate and serves to inform people. They are clear on how they intend to vote and on the positions they will take.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that spending one or two months in committee teasing out the finer points of this amendment will result in better legislation. We were elected to legislate and it is our duty to do so. We have all the information before us. To raise the matter in a spurious manner on the Order of Business or on other occasions in the House simply to oppose the Government while not being sincere about our commitment to it, does not make for good debate. I prefer to listen to what is being said in a sensible manner. However, what I have heard so far does not deal with the issues or assist the public in its understanding of what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support the Minister's intentions in this regard and I look forward to what he will say this evening. The Opposition should look again at the matter and at what its Members are saying. The public is aware of what is happening and will support what the Government is trying to achieve in this legislation. I look forward to the debate concluding successfully with the Minister's contribution.</P>

      <P>The last speaker seems to have a gift of prescience not enjoyed by other Members in so far as he is able to speak about what will be introduced later this evening by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is rather curious that he is equally able to estimate the state of knowledge of the public about something we have yet to see this evening.</P>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy what members of the public are saying when they discuss this amendment. They ask simple questions such as: &ldquo;What is this amendment about? We hear it is about judges&rdquo;. I have not heard them being told clearly by the Government that the amendment, as drafted, is a proposal to extend immunity from the superior court down to the courts which were previously governed by statute. I read the proposals as a non-lawyer. For example, judges of the District and Circuit Courts would now enjoy an additional protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that arose was a reasonable one: what has happened to justify the increasing of the threshold for impeachment of judges of the superior court? What great action have the Dáil and Seanad taken together that puts justices at peril? Then I asked myself, what has happened to <Col N="82" /> District and Circuit Court judges that they suddenly feel threatened and that they need an immunity enjoyed by judges of superior courts extended to them?</P>

      <P>When the stadium was first proposed on 26 January 2000 at a cost of £281 million, of which £50 million would be donated by J.P. McManus, it looked like an interesting idea. A feasibility study was carried out by Price Waterhouse, and it appeared as if the Government was moving forward in a prudent fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that has changed. The estimated costs have grown out of all proportion and we know from statements made by the Tánaiste that money is now being committed on the word of the Taoiseach alone without any decision by Cabinet or any adherence to ordinary budgetary procedures. The Government has acknowledged that the estimated construction cost of the project has risen to £550 million. This estimate does not include the costs of relocating the agriculture facility, Marine Institute and State Laboratory from the site, estimated by the Department of Finance at £193 million. It does not include the £20 million estimate for associated infrastructure around the <Col N="83" /> stadium, or the further £20 million for road, rail and bus services to and from the stadium. The Government's estimate ignores the financial package agreed with the FAI, valued by the FAI at £125 million and not contradicted by the Government. The recent commitment of £60 million to the GAA for the development of Croke Park is also excluded.</P>
    <P>If all the above costs are added they total £968 million. This figure allows for no cost overruns, it includes no valuation for the 500 acres of prime development land in State ownership on which the stadium will be sited, nor does it include the additional £70 million for the development of gaelic games around the country which seems to be part of the Taoiseach's deal with the GAA.</P>
    <P>Supporters of the project have claimed that the £1 billion estimated cost of the stadium was a figure pulled out of the air by Deputy Allen. This is not so. The stadium, together with all the side deals made by the Taoiseach to try to ensure that his field of dreams has a monopoly over all major games, will cost in excess of £1 billion. This is the first reason Fine Gael opposes the project.</P>
    <P>The costs are totally out of control. The Taoiseach, without consultation with his partners in Government or without sanction from the Minister for Finance, is prepared to throw any amount of money at the project to ensure that this monument to his ego is put in place. It is time that the Dáil shouted stop. Fine Gael is now shouting stop.</P>
    <P>Even if the cost could be justified, proper procedures for the spending of public money should be adhered to. It is simply not good enough that the Taoiseach should make multi-million pound commitments without consultation with his partners in Government, without Cabinet discussion or without Department of Finance sanction. This is the style of leadership and cavalier attitude to the public finances which were the hallmarks of his predecessor, Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>Public money should only be spent after proper budgetary procedures are followed. This quite clearly has not happened in this case and it is the primary cause of the well publicised row between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. Deputy Harney is entitled to be aggrieved. No Tánaiste who leads the minority party in a coalition Government should have to endure a situation where the first she learns of the expenditure of millions of pounds is from the media or from passing remarks made by colleagues.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Tánaiste would be equally concerned about the fact that the aquatic centre, which was not part of the original memorandum for Government, was added to the project at a cost of £48 million without proper Cabinet approval. The reason being given for the urgency with this element of the project is that it must be completed in time for the Special Olympics. However, I understand that the proposal that the Special Olympics use the aquatic centre at Abbotstown actually arose from an approach <Col N="84" /> from the Government to the organisers of those games, who had already made other arrangements to run the swimming events elsewhere. This is the second reason Fine Gael opposes the project &ndash; no proper financial procedures have been followed.</P>
    <P>Even if the cost of the project was moderate, there is now serious doubt about the viability of the proposed stadium. It is in the wrong place and the international experience shows that stadiums built far from the city centre are not viable. Some international comparisons make the point. In Montreal, a 55,000 seater stadium was built for the 1976 Olympics at a cost of £600 million. The debt still has not been cleared despite a special tax levy on Montreal residents. The stadium is ten miles from the city centre with a direct tram link. The average attendance at baseball games, the principle activity, is 9,000 persons. It is also used for dog shows and monster tractor pulls. The location of the stadium is regarded as the major problem. A soccer team which played there attracted crowds of 10,000 on average. Since this team moved to the city centre two years ago it is attracting crowds of 20,000 to their games.</P>
    <P>Stadium Australia at Homebush Bay in Sydney is on the brink of bankruptcy with debts of AU$196 million. The initial private sector investors are demanding further State subsidies and one of the rugby league tenants has already moved out. Australian Rules football has yet to schedule any games in the stadium. As with Montreal, the location of Stadium Australia away from the city centre is seen as a huge drawback with most sports supporters not enthusiastic about peripheral locations. Stade de France is in similar trouble, again due to its location in Paris outside the Rue Periphique and the Metro lines. It faces the same problems as those in Sydney and Montreal.</P>
    <P>Paris, Montreal and Sydney have populations in their catchment area well in excess of Dublin. There are many recently built stadia abroad which have been successful and others are planned. The Welsh Football Association and Welsh Rugby Union built the 75,000 capacity stadium in Cardiff for £140 million. It is a fine stadium and looks like being successful. Several English soccer clubs are planning new stadia. Arsenal are planning a 60,000 capacity stadium in London costing £125 million, while Manchester City's 48,000 seater ground will cost £113 million. In Germany too new stadia are planned at comparatively low cost. Bayern Munich are planning a 75,000 capacity stadium at a cost of £141 million, and a new stadium with 61,000 seats will open in Gelsenkirchen next August at a cost of £144 million. Probably they will be as successful as they are in city centre locations. They are dedicated to a particular game. They will be open to offers from other tenants and will come in at a low cost of between £120 million and £140 million. One could build ten of them for the cost of Stadium Ireland when the last coat of paint is put on the ancillary buildings. Why should the <Col N="85" /> Government build a stadium on the periphery of Dublin costing in excess of £1 billion when there are several examples, as I have outlined, of stadia in accessible locations in cities in Great Britain and Germany costing far more modest amounts? The stadium is in the wrong place and this is the third reason Fine Gael opposes it.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Taoiseach fears for the future viability of his proposal as he has attempted from the start to monopolise all major games, including some GAA games. The Government does not believe in competition despite its protestations. This is quite clear from the way both Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus run their businesses and in the slow progress being made in the deregulation of the electricity and telecommunications sectors.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has tried to create a monopoly to ensure the viability of Stadium Ireland. He dealt with the FAI through pressure and inducement until the Eircom Park project was abandoned. The Minister for Defence, no doubt at the behest of the Taoiseach, sought a judicial review of the planning approval for Eircom Park on the grounds that it would adversely affect Baldonnel Aerodrome. No such judicial review was sought in respect of the City West business park, buildings and hotels, even though they are situated just as close to Baldonnel as was the proposed Eircom Park site. If pressure was used in the case of the FAI, the Taoiseach used inducement with the GAA. It cost the Government £125 million to ensure the FAI did not build its own stadium and to ensure international soccer matches will be played in Stadium Ireland.</P>

      <P>The latest threat to the Taoiseach's proposed monopoly has come from the GAA. It was clear that the Roscommon motion at Congress would get the two-thirds majority required to open Croke Park to soccer and rugby. This would destroy the Taoiseach's monopoly and undermine the future viability of the stadium so before the vote was taken the traditionalists in the GAA were promised £60 million. This ensured that Croke Park would not need to be used for soccer and rugby to make ends meet, and that the GAA would fix two matches a year, probably all-Ireland semi-finals, in the Taoiseach's stadium. The Taoiseach was right to fear for the viability of his stadium in an open market. There are not enough matches across the codes which generate sufficient crowds to ensure the viability of the stadium and if these matches were spread across Eircom Park and Croke Park the Taoiseach's pet project would be a dead duck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capacity of Lansdowne Road is 49,000 for rugby matches and 34,000 for international soccer matches, as full seating is required. Lansdowne Road has two or three six nations rugby matches each year, for which 49,000 tickets are always sold. Another three or four non-championship rugby internationals each year are rarely sold out <Col N="86" /> unless the opposition is Australia or New Zealand, which only happens every three or four years. Between six and eight international soccer matches are held in Lansdowne Road each year, but 34,000 tickets are not always sold. Last Wednesday's match against Andorra was played before a large attendance as it was an important World Cup qualifier. There was no great difficulty in getting tickets up until the last minute, however, and it was clear from looking at television that there were unoccupied seats behind both goals, even though the match was sold out.</P>
    <P>Croke Park is always full on all-Ireland Final days but such games will continue to be played in Croke Park and not in Stadium Ireland. Last Sunday's league final between Mayo and Galway attracted 22,000 supporters to Croke Park. Attendance at all-Ireland semi-finals varies, but few would be likely to attract a crowd of 80,000. It is very difficult to see how a stadium on the periphery of the city with a capacity of 80,000 will be viable when an assessment of the possible matches to be played there is made. It seems inevitable that Croke Park will open its doors to rugby and soccer and, having the advantage of a location that will attract bigger crowds than Stadium Ireland, the Taoiseach's monopoly will be broken. The fourth reason Fine Gael opposes the project is we do not believe it is viable.</P>
    <P>At present, when budgetary surpluses are the order of the day, £1 billion is still a huge sum of money. When we compare the availability of this sum for Stadium Ireland with the small sums of money which would satisfy many of society's needs, we realise the Government's warped set of priorities. No money is provided for chemotherapy for cancer patients. Wheelchair bound passengers sit in the dark in the guard's van on CIE trains because of the lack of investment in accessible transport. There is no money for aids and appliances for the disabled, to increase nursing home subventions or for remedial teachers yet there is a £1 billion for the Taoiseach's pet project.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the record of this visionary Taoiseach in relation to services for the people of his home town, the people of north-west Dublin in particular. The hospital nearest to the proposed site for the stadium is James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. During the Taoiseach's term of office the number of people awaiting inpatient treatment in that hospital increased by 214%. One woman from Blanchardstown said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning that we have a Taoiseach who is sports minded, and good luck to him, but it would be better if we had a Taoiseach who was health minded. Certainly it would be better for the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The waiting lists for Dublin's six general hospitals have risen by an average of 77% since this Government took office and in the Eastern Regional Health Authority by 12%. In breach of the Government's guidelines, 10,337 adults have been waiting over a year for inpatient treatment for target specialities and 10,786 have been wait<Col N="87" /> ing up to a year. An average of 50% of the adults on waiting lists for target specialities have been waiting over a year, including 53% of those waiting for heart surgery.</P>
    <P>Children's health fares no better as 2,146 of them have been waiting for inpatient treatment for over six months and some for over three years. An average of 66% of all children on the waiting list for target specialities have been waiting for over six months, including 80% of those waiting for ear, nose and throat operations and 67% of those waiting for cardiac surgery. A child placed on the hospital waiting list in 1997 for a urology procedure is still waiting for treatment today. Bed shortages in the Mater Hospital, the Taoiseach's local hospital, mean that cancer patients are denied potentially life-saving treatments. This is contrary to the national cancer strategy and is a national disgrace. It shows that it would be better to have a health minded Taoiseach as the Government has been content to let the planning of our health services slide while powering ahead with the Stadium Ireland project for the greater glory of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Public transport in Dublin grinds to a halt every day, but £1 billion would pay for the Luas project, the urgently needed increase in the bus fleet and depot capacity and for the provision of an enhanced network of quality bus corridors. These improvements would make a real difference to the lives of the people of Dublin, but the Taoiseach has other priorities. He wants to spend £1 billion on a monument to himself, regardless of the real needs of the people. The warped priorities of the Government are the fifth reason Fine Gael opposes this project.</P>
    <P>I would like to reflect on why the Taoiseach is acting in this manner. Politics is unpopular at present whereas sport is very popular. Political personalities are generally unpopular but sporting personalities, the GAA and Manchester United, are popular. Any sensible Taoiseach would try to associate himself with Hill 16, Manchester United and Dublin GAA rather than be seen as the leader of the party of Mr. Haughey, Mr. Burke, or Deputies Lawlor, Foley, Ellis or Cooper-Flynn. This transfer of branding, where a politician tries to rebrand himself as the leading sports supporter in the country, has a long tradition and has been attempted by many politicians. There are still people in Ireland who think Mr. Haughey rode in the Tour de France.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, however, has raised the identification of politicians with sport to a new plane. In proposing Stadium Ireland, he hopes that when he faces the electorate he will be seen not as the leader of Fianna Fáil but as the stadium builder and the hero of sports spectators. There is nothing wrong with this ambition as the Taoiseach has a genuine interest in sport, as have many other Deputies. I strongly object, however, to the use of £1 billion of taxpayers' money in a gross attempt to rebrand Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Even if one were to invest £1 billion in sport, <Col N="88" /> the Taoiseach's priorities are wrong. Stadium Ireland is about spectators and not participants, but the national sports policy should be more concerned with participants than spectators. The facilities for sport in Dublin and throughout the country are appalling. The clubs in the various codes do an excellent job but are very badly supported by the State and there is no policy to provide facilities on a national basis to be used by those who want to participate in sport rather than by those who want to watch it. We should remember that primary schools still have no PE teachers or facilities. Most second level schools have no sports halls. The development of sport in schools depends on the voluntary activity of teachers and parents using their free time to coach and their cars to ferry children to and from games. There is a dearth of outlets for young people interested in sport and the activity of most clubs is dominated as much by fundraising as by training. This is the background against which the Taoiseach's proposal on sport should be judged.</P>
    <P>It is also important to take into account the fears of the local community. They have been widely and forcefully expressed, their opposition is well known and they should not be ignored. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will propose an amendment to this motion and I presume the Progressive Democrats will join their Fianna Fáil colleagues in the division lobby. They will survive in Government to cry wolf again. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, will huff and puff, but she will not blow the house down on this occasion, and the Government will stagger forward continuing to attempt to be all things to all men and women, while it continues to miss the best opportunity any Government has ever been given to address the real social and economic needs of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The role and responsibility of an Opposition party is to question the Government on all aspects of Government policy and public expenditure. This principle applies to Campus Ireland and Stadium Ireland just as it does to any other aspect of Government policy. Deputy Noonan, as leader of Fine Gael, and we, his party colleagues, would be reneging on our responsibilities to the people and the taxpayer if we did not ask the pertinent questions.</P>
      <P>Mr. Paddy Teahon, Chairman of Sports Campus Ireland, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday, also supported this principle. He wrote:</P>
      <P>The people of Ireland are entitled to absolute assurance that their money is being wisely used in their interests. In a democracy, every public project should be debated, and it is absolutely right that serious questions be posed about decisions that will have repercussions into the future.</P>
      <P>This is precisely what Fine Gael is now doing and being criticised for by some commentators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan and Fine Gael are certainly not &ldquo;late-comers&rdquo;, as we were described, to the <Col N="89" /> controversy surrounding Stadium Ireland. On 19 October last, the main national newspapers carried a statement by the former Minister of State with responsibility for sport and the then Fine Gael spokesperson on sport, Deputy Allen, expressing serious concern about the cost implications for Campus Ireland and indicating that the total cost of Campus Ireland, including the stadium and the relocation of the State Laboratories at Abbotstown, could be up to £1 billion. This is the figure now being used by many of the experts in the media and seems to have become the expected final cost. Deputy Allen has been vindicated despite the criticism he received then.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have also implied that the Fine Gael Party lacked vision on sports policy. I remind those people that it was a Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Donal Creed, the father of my colleague, Deputy Michael Creed, who, in the coalition Government of 1983-87, introduced and guided through the Oireachtas the legislation for the national lottery. Fianna Fáil, on returning to Government in 1987, certainly made good political use of the proceeds from the lottery.</P>
    <P>In 1995, when he was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for sport in the rainbow Government, Deputy Allen, set up an expert group under the chairmanship of John Treacy to provide a future strategy for sport. The main recommendation of this expert group was the establishment of a statutory Irish sports council, which is now in place. Last year it published its first strategy entitled A New Era for Sport. Therefore, the past two Governments in which Fine Gael served have provided the finance for sport through the national lottery and a strategy for the development of sport through the Irish Sports Council. No one can accuse Fine Gael of ignoring the needs of Irish sport. We have a proven track record when it comes to sport and we have credibility when it comes to this subject.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is opposed to Stadium Ireland and other developments on Campus Ireland strictly on cost grounds, scale and location. It is unfortunate that the Government did not commission independent consultants earlier to carry out an overview of the project along the lines outlined by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation in the Dáil today. I am sure that the independent consultants will arrive at the same conclusions and reservations that Deputy Noonan and Fine Gael is expressing here this evening. I publicly sought this type of review over four weeks ago.</P>
    <P>If Fine Gael is opposed to the national outdoor stadium on Campus Ireland, what alternative strategy are we proposing? The significant vote at the GAA congress in favour of change of Rule 42 is a clear indication that the rank and file members of the GAA are now receptive to the idea of the playing of rugby and soccer in Croke Park. The size of the vote surprised many commentators. However, it reflects a major change of attitude among GAA members across the country. No doubt if it was a secret ballot or if there <Col N="90" /> was a second vote taken that day, the motion would have been carried, and I am convinced that it will be carried at next year's congress.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons why Croke Park should be the national stadium. First, it is the home of our national games of Gaelic football and hurling. It is located close to the city centre. It is within walking distance of Heuston, Connolly and Pearse Street stations. It is also very convenient for people using Dublin airport and the car ferry ports and there are other commercial services close at hand.</P>
    <P>For a fraction of the cost of providing Stadium Ireland with its associated developments, which is now estimated to be in the region of £1 billion, the Government could not only complete Croke Park but be in a position to spend a considerable amount of money on the regeneration of the area around Croke Park, removing derelict sites and replacing them with car-parking facilities to serve both the spectator at Croke Park and the public doing business and working in the city centre and, in co-operation with Dublin Corporation, providing better housing for some of the communities in the vicinity of the stadium. I am sure the residents around Croke Park would enthusiastically embrace this type of development. They would no longer suffer the types of problems they have experienced over the years with parking and other inconveniences. Surely this approach would appeal to the Taoiseach, as Croke Park is in his heartland.</P>
    <P>The question of traffic congestion on the M50 has yet to be addressed. I appreciate that the Minister is waiting for the high level group, which he has set up to examine the public transport needs of the campus, to report back to him. However, as the M50 is already congested at peak periods and has become a thoroughfare for access to recently developed shopping centres, business parks, future housing developments and other facilities which attract huge volumes of traffic, it will be very difficult, irrespective of what the Government will put in place, to meet the additional traffic requirements of a major sporting event at the proposed Stadium Ireland. No doubt the campus will lead to traffic chaos.</P>
    <P>The greater city centre area, with its existing facilities, has proven that it can absorb a massive influx of people for big sporting events and St. Patrick's Day parades, which draw crowds of up to one million people. The Taoiseach should look to the American cities of Cleveland, Baltimore, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix or Denver to see how sports facilities and revitalisation plans can change the face of an urban landscape and can have huge beneficial long-term effects. All these stadia, which also attract large volumes of pedestrian traffic, are in areas where there are existing hotels, restaurants, guesthouses and other facilities. These facilities do not exist at Abbotstown. It will be impossible to create this type of infrastructure overnight or even in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Part of the novelty of attending big games in <Col N="91" /> Croke Park or Lansdowne Road is the atmosphere in the local bars and hotels leading up to the game. This is all seen as part of the day out or even the weekend. You will lose this with a stadium in Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>I was in Boston two weeks ago and stayed in a city centre hotel. I went to see the Boston Celtics play an NBA match in their new stadium, The Fleet Centre. The following day I saw the Red Sox baseball team play the New York Yankees. Both of these stadia were within walking distance of the centre of Boston and are integrated into the commercial life of the city.</P>
    <P>The working model cited at the launch of Sports Campus Ireland was Homebush Bay, the site of the Sydney Games. We now know that the operators are facing huge difficulties with the financial sustainability of the stadium because of its comparative remoteness from Sydney city centre. The Aquatic Centre at Homebush has proven to be very successful and has a throughput of 100,000 customers a month. However, the 20,000 seater indoor stadium, which is host to the Sydney Kings Basketball Team, has failed to attract other activities, which it needs to pay its way. Serious financial problems surround the Olympic Stadium.</P>
    <P>The Australian Football League has pulled its games out of the stadium. The Sydney Swans, the local football team, has shown no interest in using the stadium and the rival Bulldogs are also seeking a more convenient venue for their games. They all say that huge stadium lacks atmosphere when the crowd is not at capacity level.</P>
    <P>During a recent visit to Homebush Bay, New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, said that, &ldquo;With the best will in the world it is going to take some effort over some years to get this seen as part of the life of the city.&rdquo; The same could be said of Abbotstown. Michael Knight, the chief executive of the Sydney Games, said, &ldquo;I don't know how much it will take to prevent Homebush Bay from becoming a giant white elephant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Massive investment was made in a transport system and in providing hotels and other services at Homebush Bay and it appears to be in deep financial trouble. In the first six months of this year it has lost AU $5.7 million. The Homebush Bay Sports Campus is located at the edge of Sydney, a city with a population of 3.5 million. If an 80,000 seater stadium and all the ancillary facilities are not viable in Sydney, it is hard to expect Dublin, with one third of Sydney's population, to sustain two 80,000 seater stadia. The Government should not ignore the lessons of Homebush Bay.</P>
    <P>At the launch of the Sports Campus Ireland project on 23 February, the Minister said, &ldquo;I believe what we are building here represents a major national and community amenity, and that it will contribute to Ireland's quality of life in the medium term&rdquo;. My view is that it will be very difficult to find a balance between community usage of the facilities and catering for the needs of our elite athletes. How would concerts and <Col N="92" /> other events involving large numbers fit into a campus where some of our top athletes would be preparing for major events? Professional sports people need space to train and reflect. Individuals and teams need to train in comparative privacy. Team managers and coaches will not be comfortable with a campus that serves the broader community at the same time as professional athletes, for example, in a case where a local community group may be using the pool when professional swimmers need it.</P>
    <P>When talking to one of the country's top sports coaches recently he expressed a number of reservations about centralising facilities on Campus Ireland. He favoured a more regional and local approach and pointed out that to nurture and develop young athletes with potential, it is the daily contact with a qualified coach and back-up facilities that develops the athlete.</P>
    <P>It seems the policy of the Government and the Irish Sports Council is more concerned with the promotion of elite sports and spectator accommodation at national level than with mass participation. Study after study highlights how unfit and overweight Irish people are becoming. A study launched by the Food Safety Promotion Board on 13 March delivered a worrying picture for large numbers of the population who, in some cases, spend up to 25 hours a week watching television when they should be exercising. The report of that study shows that vigorous physical activity among both sexes is low, with 41% of men and 60% of women describing walking as their most important recreational pursuit. Nearly half of women between 51 and 64 do no strenuous exercise. That study also pointed out that two and a half times more men, 20% more, are obese now than was the case only ten years ago. That shows that our sports policy on mass participation is not working.</P>
    <P>Any sports policy should place emphasis on the provision of physical education in our schools, a point which Deputy Noonan made. I carried out a national survey in 1990 to which I received a response from 1,500 schools. That survey showed physical education was at a very low level in our schools. It was not being provided because of a lack of facilities and a lack of expertise and confidence among teachers. The recent survey bears out what I warned about at that time, that we were sitting on a medical time bomb. That is now coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>After the Atlanta Olympics, the British Government reviewed its sports policy. We saw the results of that last year. It also committed 20% of lottery funds to school facilities and it placed major emphasis on the provision of school facilities. Any future sports policy should concentrate on the provision of school facilities.</P>
    <P>We are putting the cart before the horse. We need to put a massive amount of money into fostering mass participation. I agree we need to look after our elite athletes and provide facilities. It is difficult to justify expenditure of £1 billion on a <Col N="93" /> campus when we are neglecting several other aspects of our sports policy.</P>

      <P>Stadium Ireland is the wrong sports policy for Ireland at this juncture. It is wrong because of the cost and location and for numerous other reasons outlined by previous speakers.

      <P>There is more largesse now than there was when we were in government. We distributed as much money to sport as was possible when we were in government.</P>
      <P>This is a policy to facilitate elite participation in sport at the expense of public participation. It is about bums on seats watching sports when we need to get bums off seats and encourage people to participate in sports.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes that our sports policy should be about sport for all. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, in a press statement some weeks ago acknowledged that 40% of students in primary schools do not participate in any form of sports. Fine Gael also believes that in prioritising development, we should develop facilities at local level initially, as there is great interest at that level but poor facilities. We should then develop regional facilities and the icing on the cake would be the kind of facility, a national sports stadium, envisaged for Stadium Ireland but not in that location. We should foster a greater understanding of the link between participation in sport and good health. For that reason the role of education and educational institutions throughout the country is a key instrument to developing sports policy.</P>
      <P>We heard the Minister musing publicly about why we had such an Olympic fiasco in Sydney, why we did not win more medals. We believe it is not because we did not have Stadium Ireland but because many people have been lost to participating in sports at a much earlier stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach appears to operate a sports policy that is based on see and be seen at sports facilities. He rounded on the critics of Stadium Ireland because he did not see them at a match. That speaks volumes. What we need is more people participating, not bums on seats.</P>
      <P>At a time when the State spends a grand total of £3.25 per student per year on promoting sports in primary school, the Government proposes to spend £1 billion, that is, £1 million every week for 20 years, on the construction of Stadium Ireland. This figure takes no account of the ongoing financial costs of running the complex which, if the Olympic Stadium in Sydney is anything to go by, will require enormous amounts of Exchequer funds annually to keep it afloat. Croke Park, which has the support of the largest sporting organisation in the country and can guarantee, on a regular basis, the largest gate for any sporting organisation, finds itself in difficulty in terms of its financial viability. How can Stadium Ireland be viable if Croke Park is not viable? At a time when 54% of all primary schools do not have a general purposes room, when 78% of our primary schools report that they cannot implement the physical education programme because of inadequate space and 67% of primary schools report that they need either additional or replacement physical education equipment, it is madness in the extreme to spend £1 billion on Stadium Ireland when the most basic elements of a national sports infrastructure are absent at local community and schools level.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, has acknowledged that 40% of students do not participate in school sports. This, along with documented evidence of increasing levels of obesity, is a wake-up call which the Government is not heeding. Sports policy should be based primarily on maximum participation levels, rather than bums on seats as in Stadium Ireland. The money should be spent on improving local facilities and fostering maximum participation in sports.</P>

    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;recognises the Government's support for sport at all levels and the substantial increase in current and capital funding for sport from £13.5 million in 1997, when this Government took office, to £83 million in 2001;</P>
    <P>recognises the importance of sport in the social, cultural and economic life of the nation and the contribution which it makes to a healthy society; recognises the need for the development of new sporting infrastructure; notes the work done to date in advancing the development of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland;</P>
    <P>welcomes the decision of the Government to develop an aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown as part of the country's preparations to host the Special Olympics in 2003; supports the Government's decision to undertake a comprehensive review of the direct and indirect costs and benefits of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project; and notes the terms of reference of such review agreed by the Government on 1 May 2001&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised at the contributions of Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Creed to this debate. I am not so surprised at Deputy Noonan's contribution. He has come into the situation quite recently and has assumed an interest in sport, perhaps to mark the Taoiseach's interest in this regard. In contradiction to his own terms, since he understands the benefit of sport to the community, it is due to the lip service which has been paid to sport for many years that we have had to listen to drivel from Deputy Noonan with regard to the health services. The resources being put into the health services have increased from £2.6 billion to £5.3 billion and&mdash;</P>

The Fine Gael attitude towards health is to keep building hospitals. Instead of arguing about the health services, we should take preventive action in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I address the House in support of the Government's motion on Campus Stadium Ireland, I have a very interesting document which serves to expose the blatant opportunism that has prompted the negative and timid motion put forward this evening by the Fine Gael Party. The document in question was produced in response to a request from Deputy Gay Mitchell as Pres<Col N="96" /> ident of the Dublin International Sports Council when he was Lord Mayor of our capital city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it should be available.</P>
      <P>An eminent firm of international accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was asked by Deputy Mitchell to report on the challenges facing Dublin should it decide to make a bid for the Olympic Games. That was under Deputy John Bruton's leadership of Fine Gael, not Deputy Noonan's 12-week-old &ldquo;new Fine Gael&rdquo;. I should point out that Deputy Mitchell was at that time an enthusiastic proponent of Dublin as a venue for the Olympic Games and one is entitled to assume that his enthusiasm was shared by his party colleagues. Certainly, none of them expressed any word of dissent in regard to that ambitious objective.</P>
      <P>That PricewaterhouseCoopers report noted some essential requirements which must surely cause embarrassment on the Fine Gael benches this evening under Deputy Noonan's leadership. High on its priorities was a stipulation that we would need a main stadium capable of accommodating 70,000 to 100,000 spectators. There was an impressive list of ancillary arenas to accommodate baseball, basketball, boxing, fencing, a velodrome, four fully seated football stadia, arenas for volleyball, hockey, handball and, of course, a 50 metre pool. It may come as a source of some consolation to Deputy Mitchell that even Fine Gael seems to agree to the 50 metre pool and he will no doubt be glad to learn that the Government intends to provide two. One is already under construction in Limerick and the other will be part of Campus Stadium Ireland, where it will be used by competitors in the Special Olympics of 2003.</P>

      <P>This serves to highlight the rather obvious fact that there is no point in going out to the sporting world canvassing for major international events, whether they be world championships or European Cup games, unless we have the facilities to accommodate them. In short, there is no point in seeking 21st century events with early 19th century facilities, as the Ryder Cup experience proves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many excellent arguments to bring forward in support of a project of the magnitude of Campus Stadium Ireland. One of the most compelling of those arguments is that an ultra modern state-of-the-art sports facility such as the <Col N="97" /> one envisaged at Abbotstown will put Dublin and Ireland in a position to bid for major crowd-pulling international events that are at present simply beyond our reach. In that sense, I see Campus Stadium Ireland as a major revenue generating asset for sport in Ireland. The high level of interest already evident from the private sector in regard to the provision of facilities, accommodation and services at Abbotstown supports that view.</P>
    <P>I am proud our major team sports organisations, the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, are to be supportive partners in this project. As anchor tenants they will provide a core series of main attractions but, as I suggested earlier, I believe that in assessing the potential of this project we have to look further afield and further ahead. Parnell said that no man can set a boundary to the onward march of a nation and say thus far shalt thou go and no further. In that spirit I see Campus Stadium Ireland in the years ahead as a venue for international events that up to now we could not even contemplate.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the opportunistic nature of this Fine Gael motion. Over the past few days the Fine Gael Leader, Deputy Noonan, has been wringing his hands and widely exaggerating the supposed cost of the project. He spoke of a cost ten times greater than that of stadia in Cardiff and Sydney. Does the Deputy know the cost of the stadium? The cost is £230 million. Deputy Noonan even went so far as to threaten an edict to halt the whole project if he became Taoiseach. Indeed, he somewhat presumptuously said he would carry out this threat whenever he became Taoiseach. God help sport in this country if that is the Fine Gael position under its current leader. Indeed, he, somewhat presumptuously, said he would carry out this threat when he became Taoiseach. God help sport in this country if that is the Fine Gael position under this leader.</P>

      <P>It is curious to say the least, that Deputy Noonan's concern about the national stadium project and sport in general found no expression whatsoever in his major address to the Fine Gael Ard Fheis as recently as 3 March last at Ballsbridge. One would think that if Fine Gael's concern was genuine it might have merited one small mention at the party's annual convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many respects, this motion is unfortunately all too characteristic of the timidity and lack of vision that has marked Fine Gael's approach to major national undertakings down the years. Deputy Noonan, as a Limerick man, will not like to be reminded that a Fine Gael leader once forecast the doom of Shannon Airport and envisaged the day when Shannon would revert to the rabbits. They showed a similar lack of enthusiasm for Knock Airport, Government Buildings and Dublin Castle. But then they have always tended to play the critics' role and only very rarely have <Col N="98" /> they tried to be creative. Perhaps, that is why Deputy Noonan has spent so many years in opposition. Today's prosperity was built on a positive entrepreneurial spirit over the past 12 years and Fianna Fáil has been in Government for almost ten of those years, seven of them with the Progressive Democrats and three with Labour.</P>
    <P>It is not often that an individual project engenders as much debate, discussion and analysis as has Sports Campus Ireland since its announcement 16 months ago. Since the start of this year alone, when I assumed overall responsibility for the project, there have been more than 50 parliamentary questions on various related issues. It was the subject of a Private Members' motion in January &ndash; this is the second such motion this year &ndash; and countless column inches and air-time minutes have been devoted to it.</P>

It would indeed be a sad day for democracy if the biggest single project undertaken by the State, and one which will benefit the lives of generations of Irish people, present and future, were to materialise without notice or remark. Furthermore, this scrutiny by the Oireachtas, the public and the media is but a reflection of the extensive and intensive examination to which the project has been and continues to be subjected by the Government, its Ministers and their Departments, not least my own.</P>

      <P>There seems to be an impression abroad that the stadium and sports campus Ireland projects are being planned without due regard for appropriate approval procedures. Deputy Noonan also pointed out that it was not a decision of Government. I would like to point out that the swimming pool was a decision of Government taken on 12 July 2000 and it is not true to say that the Special Olympics organisation did not want the pool. It was fully involved in the consultations on the pool.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to dispel some of the myths which exist. It was the Government that decided to commission a feasibility study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers and to accept its recommendations on the provision of a national sports campus and stadium for Ireland. It was this Government that decided on the establishment of a dedicated development company &ndash; Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Ltd. or CSID &ndash; to oversee the development and construction of the campus and its facilities, and, with the support of this House, <Col N="99" /> allocated Exchequer resources to the company for this task.</P>
      <P>Again, it was the Government that, having accepted that the State-owned lands at Abbotstown represented the optimum site for the project &ndash; 21 sites were examined &ndash; decided to undertake the necessary development and upgrading of the State laboratories at a new location. It was the Government too that decided to set up a specialist high-level group to look at the public transport needs of the campus and Blanchardstown in full consultation with the local communities. Even if there were to be no campus, the investment in road, rail, Luas and metro infrastructure would still be required to meet the needs of an area large enough in population terms to qualify as one of Ireland's ten largest towns.</P>
      <P>It was the Government that accepted the development company's recommendation in respect of the outcome of its first tendering competition to build the pool at Abbotstown, a competition, I should add, that was conducted in accordance with European public procurement provisions, and it was the Governement too that decided on the financial allocation for that project. Heads of Agreement for the aquatic and leisure centre have been signed and final draft terms of agreement are currently the subject of urgent negotiations in order to ensure that the swimming pool is operational in time for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003.</P>
      <P>It was the Government too that, to assist it in determining final Exchequer allocations for the stadium and sports campus Ireland, and the sensitivity of such allocations to variations in the scale of each element of the project, today agreed that I would commission independent consultants to undertake an overview of the stadium and Sports Campus Ireland, terms of which I have read into the Dáil record today during Question Time and which I will exclude at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an international group of consultants that will deal with it and I will come to that matter eventually.</P>
      <P>As I speak, the best professional estimate of the total cost of the sports campus Ireland project is £550 million. This includes a figure of £230 million for the stadium alone, and Deputy Noonan gets confused with the cost of all the other stadia. They are all in and around the same price &ndash; £230 million. I might add that there is a £50 million contingency plan placed in that £230 million so they are all coming in at around the average cost of Deputy Noonan's stadium.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Also included is a figure of £320 million for the other facilities, many of which are required for the Special Olympics in 2003. This gives a total estimated cost of £550 million for the entire campus and stadium project, of which the projected Exchequer investment is £350 million, the balance being made up of a private donation of £50 million and projected private sector investment, conservative I might add, of £150 million &ndash; and this for a project that includes waterways, parkways, and sports facilities that will be a real family destination where thousands will visit every week.</P>

When, and only when, the international tendering competition is completed will we have actual estimates of costing; what the private sector is prepared to invest and what Exchequer contribution will be required.

I find it very reassuring, as I am sure will all Members of the House, that such high calibre investors want to be part of this project. In the meantime, and pending completion of the overview, I can assure the House that the Government and I will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that stringent control is maintained over the costs of the project. It is the right of the Opposition to be concerned about risks but the only way to avoid all risks is to do nothing.</P>

      <P>As I said before, the decision to build a national sports campus and stadium is a logical progression from, and complements, the contribution of the Government to the development of sport since it assumed office in 1997. The Opposition put a pittance into sport through the years. It put £3 million per annum into the swimming pool programme. We give that sum as a grant to each swimming pool. We put £83 million into sports facilities. We are building up a sporting infrastructure throughout the country which will give the next generation an opportunity to participate in sport. It will ultimately add to the health of the country and that will mean that we will not need to build hospitals as we are doing now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fair to say that all parties in this House are in favour of State support for the sporting sector. I had the privilege of serving as this country's first Minister for sport, appointed <Col N="102" /> in 1969, and was responsible for paying out the very first grants to the sporting bodies in spring 1970. In the 1970s the pickings were very slim by modern standards. I think I had £100,000 and my vision was to see it rise to £1 million. Today, I am very proud to be a member of a Government which has not just delivered huge increases in the sports budget but has spread that money widely across different sporting organisations.</P>
      <P>Recent progress notwithstanding, we are still a long way behind our European partners when it comes to sporting infrastructure and support for sporting activity at both national and local level. At national level, we have not been able to offer Irish sports followers the kind of modern stadium facilities which they take for granted when they travel to Britain or the Continent for soccer or rugby matches. Visits to Old Trafford and the Nou Camp, Twickenham and the Stade de France, serve to highlight for Irish people the enormous gap that exists between Ireland and the rest of Europe in terms of sporting infrastructure. The redevelopment of Croke Park will provide us with a modern sports stadium for the first time, but our other major grounds will still lag far behind. At local and community level the gap between ourselves and our European neighbours is even greater. Thanks to lottery funds and the huge voluntary effort of the main sporting organisations, there has been a significant improvement in recent years but our facilities still fall far short of what they should be.</P>
      <P>We are now one of the wealthiest societies in the developed world but it is still commonplace to see youngsters togging out in ditches or teams using shipping containers as makeshift dressing rooms. We have to make improvements. We have to close the gap between ourselves and other countries, and that will take money. The Progressive Democrats recognises that and strongly supports the concept of extra money for sport at all levels.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House this evening stems from the offer of £60 million to the GAA for the redevelopment of Croke Park. We have no difficulty with giving money to the GAA&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;an organisation which has made an enormous contribution to the social, cultural and sporting life of this country. We have no difficulty with the concept of State aid for the ambitious plan to turn Croke Park into a state-of-the-art modern sports stadium, but we have a duty to the taxpayers to ensure that when the Government puts substantial public money into a project we get value for that money for the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the scale of assistance being offered to the GAA for Croke Park, I consider it only fair and reasonable that both parties approach this matter in a spirit of partnership. In other words, in return for substantial assistance from the tax<Col N="103" /> payers, the GAA would be willing to remove the prohibition on opening Croke Park to the other major sporting codes. This is not, I believe, an unreasonable request. Nobody is trying to tell the GAA how to run its affairs. The recent congress showed that there is a clear majority within the GAA in favour of a more open approach.</P>
    <P>Some people say that sport and politics do not mix. It is a pity the debate triggered by the Croke Park controversy should have brought us back in some unfortunate instances to the kind of emotive and sectarian language which we thought we had left behind. We hear talk of 'castle Catholics' and 'garrison games'. The implication seems to be that followers of certain sports are somehow less Irish than the followers of others. That is very backward thinking and I reject it outright. It also ignores the ecumenical reality of Irish sport. The vast majority of Irish people are avid followers of several codes. They are just as at home in Croke Park as in Lansdowne Road. They see sport as a unifying influence in Irish life, not a divisive one.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the proposed development of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland at Abbotstown has given rise to concern within my party. The Abbotstown project is large and ambitious by any standards. With the construction industry working at full capacity there is a risk that building costs could soar out of control and we have to guard against that. We must also be conscious of the changed economic circumstances. Our economy is still growing strongly, thanks to the Government's excellent stewardship and the proven success of its policies, but the pace of growth has slackened. The slowdown in the United States and the foot and mouth crisis here have applied the brakes to the Irish economy. We will still grow at more than twice the EU average this year but the need for fiscal prudence is now greater than ever.</P>
    <P>Ministers have recently been asked to scale back spending plans in a number of areas. We have been asked to trim capital investment proposals against a background of rising tender prices. As a result we are looking at our priorities to determine where capital investment is needed most, what projects are of immediate importance and what ones can be deferred for a year or two. It is in this context that we have to look at Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is one of the single biggest capital projects on the drawing board. It is one of the biggest capital projects ever contemplated in the history of the State. It will tie up considerable resources in the construction industry for years. Given the tightness in that industry, Abbotstown can only proceed by displacing other projects. It is vital, therefore, that we get a clear picture of what is involved before proceeding further.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats has called for a comprehensive overview of the whole project. Such an overview was agreed between the two Government parties this morning. The terms of reference for that overview have been agreed and <Col N="104" /> work on appointing the consultants will get under way with immediate effect. We want to see the full picture and to know exactly for what the Government is being asked to sign up. Specifically we want to know the full cost of relocating the State laboratories from the lands at Abbotstown, of providing all the necessary infrastructural links to the site, especially road and rail, the construction cost of Stadium Ireland, the main component of the campus and each of the other component projects&mdash;</P>

      <P>Much of this information will flow from the competitive tendering process which is currently under way and due for completion next month. Once we have a full picture of the costs involved we will be able to make a decision. No further legally binding agreements will be entered into until the overview is completed. This is a sensible, reasonable way to proceed and manage the development of a major and complex capital project, the scale of which has never been attempted here. The Progressive Democrats believe this approach represents the best way of protecting the interests of the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>There have been several cases in the past where public capital projects have seriously overrun their budgets. Quite rightly, we then have investigations, examinations and inquiries by Oireachtas committees to find out what went wrong &ndash; we try to be wise after the event. The Progressive Democrats believe that with this project it is better to be wise before the event and we should make a more accurate and rigorous estimate of the total costs involved before we commit the taxpayers to funding the development.</P>

    <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Rabbitte and Stagg.</P>
    <P>To say that stadium and campus Ireland as a project has been handled in a disastrous fashion in a political and public relations context does not overstate the position. The issues which have most concerned people are the escalating cost of the project together with the machinations and manoeuvring which have taken place off stage. The Government ruthlessly and successfully undermined the Eircom Park project. The FAI was eventually made an offer which could not be refused. This was done using taxpayers' money. We still do not have the full details of the agreement in principle reached between the Government and the FAI. Neither do we have the full details of the agreement in principle with the GAA and the IRFU regarding use of the national stadium.</P>
    <P>The Campus Stadium Ireland Bill, which is to provide for the establishment of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, the development company for the construction of Sports Campus Ireland at Abbotstown, make provisions relating to the company and provide for connected matters, has yet to have the heads approved by Government, even though the Government's legislative programme of spring 2001, published on 25 January, indicated that publication of the Bill was due in mid-year. The Government's legislative programme for the summer session 2001, published on 26 April, indicates that the heads are being prepared in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and that publication is expected in late 2001.</P>
    <P>Tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money are being flung in all directions by the Taoiseach in a scattered attempt to pull the various elements <Col N="106" /> together. The timing of the announcement of the agreement in principle with the GAA was not an accident. It contributed to a public relations disaster for the GAA which exposed the Taoiseach as meddling in the internal affairs of an independent, democratic organisation. It exposed him as going on a solo run with huge amounts of taxpayers' money and not keeping his partners in Government up to speed. His actions have destabilised the Government and have brought into sharp focus the many matters in relation to basic social services and inadequate sports infrastructure nationwide which are seriously underfunded. The image of the Taoiseach, fixated on what he calls his vision, stumbling and tripping in bringing it to fruition and recklessly using taxpayers' money to bring the project past the next hurdle, was finally too much even for the Progressive Democrats, and a halt was brought to his gallop.</P>
    <P>There is another issue of major concern regarding the agreement in principle between the Taoiseach and the GAA. It must be acknowledged that the GAA is a 32 county, independent, democratic body which the Government cannot direct to change its rules. The agreement in principle that the GAA play up to five matches per year in the national stadium, with an overall attendance of 200,000, raises rule 21 of the association. That rule bans members of the RUC and the British Army from membership of the GAA. This has implications regarding the development of a cross-community police force for Northern Ireland. There are contingent implications for the peace process and the Belfast Agreement. It appears the national stadium, involving many millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, will not be accessible to all citizens resident on the island of Ireland because they cannot play for GAA teams on the basis of their type of employment, namely, membership of the RUC. In fairness to the Taoiseach, I doubt this was his intention but it is an issue which must be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>The basic issues regarding campus and stadium Ireland which must be addressed are contained in the Labour Party amendment to the Fine Gael motion. How can an 80,000 seater stadium be justified or viable bearing in mind the ongoing development of Croke Park? There is also major public concern regarding the escalating cost of the project. This has been belatedly addressed by the Government which has conceded the need for an independent cost-benefit analysis. The Labour Party is seeking that this value for money audit be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and that the Dáil officially requests him to carry out a further cost benefit analysis on a 50,000 seater stadium. I note the Minister said tonight that the intention is that international consultants will be involved in the independent audit, but I do not see why the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot take the place of the steering committee mentioned in reply to a parliamentary question that I tabled today.</P>
    <P>In the interests of democracy, the Dáil should <Col N="107" /> further resolve that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report be debated in the Dáil prior to its adoption by Government. Given the position of the Oireachtas in terms of the mishandling by the Government of the Campus and Stadium Ireland project, it should direct that no contracts or commitments be entered into prior to the agreement by the Oireachtas on the Campus and Stadium Ireland Bill.</P>
    <P>The campus of sporting excellence aspect of the campus and stadium Ireland project has much to recommend it. The 50 metre swimming pool is necessary for the Special Olympics in 2003. The Labour Party supports the provision of appropriate state of the art sporting facilities at national level and is demanding that the Government brings forward a strategic plan for the provision of sporting facilities at regional and local level. The Government must get real and maintain a sense of proportion at a time when the Exchequer is awash with money. Campus and stadium Ireland must not be to a scale that prevents the provision of a full and proper quality of life for all our citizens.</P>

      <P>In the short time available to Deputy O'Shea and myself, and other Deputies, it is difficult to do justice to what the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has called the largest capital project in the history of the State. The project is out of control, the Taoiseach is out of touch and the Tánaiste is out of the loop. The Tánaiste may well huff and puff, but she will not blow down the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;. She knows there is growing outrage as more people learn what precisely is involved. She is trying to position herself to empathise with that mood while all the time having given her assent to what she implies will be a white elephant &ndash; her words, not mine. Meanwhile the Taoiseach has reverted to his old habit of signing blank cheques with the taxpayers' cheque book. Huge cheques can be signed to the FAI to kill off Eircom Park, to the GAA to keep Croke Park closed both to other games and for most of the year, to clear the park and relocate the services to Kildare and Galway. All these huge taxpayers' cheques are in addition to the £550 million committed to the record several times by the Minister, Deputy McDaid. None of this puts a value on the 500 acres of land within the footprint of the greater Dublin area. For example, my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, assures me it is true the Government's figure of £160 million to clear the park has now risen to £188 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the rationale for this mother of all public sector projects, or joint venture projects if one believes private partners will emerge? Do we need a second 80,000 seater stadium? If we do, what would be a reasonable cost for it, and what would be the ideal location? In the case of the stadia with major soccer clubs as anchor tenants, a minimum of about 25 fixtures per annum is guaranteed. Since we are not participants in any <Col N="108" /> league similar to the premiership, it is not possible to envisage other than a few exceptional events that might attract 80,000 people. In so far as Croke Park finals or semi-finals may be included in those exceptional events, they will certainly be played at Croke Park. Last Sunday, the league final between Mayo and Galway attracted fewer than 23,000 paying fans. Despite the Taoiseach's best efforts, Croke Park is inexorably moving towards hosting the occasional rugby and soccer event, and it is only the very exceptional such occasion that will require capacity for 80,000 fans. We may, depending on the plans for Lansdowne Road, need a modest, no-frills, 45,000 seater stadium such as was planned for Eircom Park. For example, Manchester City is planning to complete a 48,000 seater stadium for the summer of 2002 at a cost of IR£113 million.</P>
    <P>As in so many other things, international experience has taught us that, in respect of stadia, location is also important. How does a capacity attendance manage access and egress? Are there hotels, pubs, restaurants within walking distance and so on? It makes sense to complete the splendid stadium at Croke Park, although I deplore the manner in which the Taoiseach's intervention stymied an historic decision by the GAA Congress. An additional stadium, such as Eircom Park, would complete the jigsaw in an inevitably more ecumenical sporting environment in the future.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how the monument envisaged for Abbotstown can be justified in the context of young people togging out in cold containers up and down the country and where sports endeavour is predominantly dependent on voluntary effort and non-stop fund-raising. If Abbotstown proceeds, it will be the graveyard of the Progressive Democrats' much trumpeted reason for existence, to stop the profligate waste of public money. Clearly the four independent Deputies have more clout now in this Government than does the Progressive Democrats Party, which is reduced to the status of merely a guest in Government. Tonight, in the terms of reference announced by the Minister, it is clear that they are calculated to get us as far as the general election, and after that we will see what happens.</P>
    <P>On the BBC website tonight, one can see that the Wembley project has collapsed and I quote:</P>
    <P>The £475m scheme has been beset by problems over the past two years and is now in crisis after being unable to secure adequate funding from the City of London. &ldquo;We cannot act as the sole sponsor of the scheme,&rdquo; said an FA spokesman. . . &ldquo;Neither sports governing bodies, nor banks will take the risks associated with such a project.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Culture Secretary Chris Smith stated: &ldquo;It is clear that escalating costs &ndash; which have risen from £334m to £660m &ndash; have played a key role&rdquo;. In other words, what has happened in Wembley is that the costs went from £334 million to £660 million, which is as close to double as one can get. <Col N="109" /> What happened in regard to Croke Park is that the cost doubled. What happened in respect of Eircom Park &ndash; and apart from&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is wonderful that we have so much wealth that we can contemplate spending in excess of £1,000 million on a monument to our great leader, the Taoiseach. We have this excess wealth despite giving massive tax breaks to the wealthiest sections of our society and operating a wealth and corporate tax regime that is the envy of every right-wing regime in the world. The Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government, therefore, with the full support from the so-called four Independents, decided on the priority for this now wealthy nation. It decided not to spend the money on a modern public transport system, despite the fact that every town and city is grinding to a halt. There are all sorts of plans in this area, but there has been precious little action from the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. It decided not to reorganise and fund the health services, even in the face of cancer patients being refused vital treatment.</P>

      <P>The Government had another priority. It was not transport, health, education or housing. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats with the so-called spineless Independents, decided their priority was to be a sports stadium on a grand scale such as we had never dreamed of and at a price we can hardly comprehend, £1,000 million. If there is £1,000 million available for sport, let us have a debate on how best to use this public money.</P>
      <P>Recently we discussed law and order in this House, and several Members referred to the reality of large numbers of young people congregating in housing estates in a menacing way in middle-class and working-class areas.

      <P>What else do we offer them? For the younger ones, there is the off-licence, a sort of training ground for the pub culture. Now we have an opportunity, and we have the money to enable us to grasp that opportunity. If the £1,000 million that is to be spent on the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; were to be applied to the needs of young people throughout the country, it would be possible to spend £24 million on sporting facilities in each of the 42 constituencies in this republic. That would provide first-class swimming pools and ancillary facilities in every town in my constituency, in Naas, Celbridge, Leixlip, Maynooth, Kilcock and Clane. A total of 60,000 people in north Kildare do not have a swimming pool. It would also provide the existing sports club with the capital to upgrade its facilities and attract young people to it. A bottom up approach such as this would have real benefit for the tens of thousands of youths in every town and village. However, the Government seems determined to go for the elite option, the prestige option, the one that makes provision for a handful of athletes just to satisfy the pride of one individual, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. It is the public's money with which the <Col N="111" /> Minister is playing. It belongs to the parents of the young people he is condemning, by his actions, to a pub culture and all that flows from it. I urge him, even at this late stage, to think again and to adopt a bottom up approach to sports provision that can serve many rather than a top down approach which can only serve an elite few.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House, I propose to share my time with Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>In my introductory remarks I asked what the public is to make of this amendment of the Constitution which will be put before it dealing with judges and their accountability and I probably understated the confusion that exists in the public mind, particularly the dissatisfaction with what has been proposed in terms of its ability to answer what was a very reasonable intention to establish accountability for judges.</P>
      <P>The following are questions raised by the public. What behaviour of the Parliament has taken place to justify increasing the threshold from a simple majority to a two-thirds majority? What has taken place that requires immunity to be extended from the superior court to courts governed previously by statute? The public has not issued any demand for the protection of District and Circuit Court judges nor has it suggested that judges of the superior courts are under some immediate threat from the Parliament. As a Member of Parliament, I would like to know the basis for this under-labourer version of Parliament and parliamentarians. Surely the public intention was in regard to those who share the division of powers with us in Parliament, a division of powers between the Judiciary and the Executive in the administration of this country with which I have no difficulty and which every Member of this House respects? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are parliamentarians, the Minister, in particular, operating on the basis that there is some threat to that independence from the Parliament? Why is it necessary to change the arrangement from a simple majority, which has sufficed since the 18th century, to the proposed arrangement of <Col N="112" /> a two-thirds majority &ndash; two-thirds majority to make a charge and to introduce a sanction? The public will say if it votes &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in this referendum, what will it have done other than extend immunity downwards and make more difficult the calling to account of judges in very limited circumstances of abuse? Again, the public will reasonably ask what process will take place if a charge is made and sustained if the investigation is carried out by a body that can, as it were, make recommendations? In a most curious kind of remark by the Minister, he suggests that the most it can do is exercise some kind of moral suasion seeking a guarantee that the behaviour referred to will not happen again. This is very far from being a sanction nor does it deal with the reality about which the public expressed its concern.</P>
    <P>If, for example, as has been pointed out by the Labour spokesperson on justice, Deputy Howlin, we are only talking about those matters that are the stuff of impeachment now, why do we need another body to make recommendations and leave blank how the recommendations are to be implemented? The process is not specified. The sanctions are left there.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects about which the public is concerned, behaviour adverted to in the Hamilton report, behaviour that stops short of that which merits impeachment but which may be incompetent. One that has been raised with me on several occasions is gross discourtesy to those before the court or those professionals speaking on their behalf. What is being proposed does not deal with any of this.</P>
    <P>The net effect of what is being proposed will secure the opposite of the public's concern which was to put a procedure in place that was self-evident, would be able, while respecting autonomy, to address issues other than those that required impeachment and from that to be able to assure the quality of judges in their behaviour and judgments. It is extraordinary that the Minister would, in crafting these very inadequate and curiously paradoxical proposals in terms of political intention, operate with such a malignant view of his fellow parliamentarians. I would have thought it very interesting, for example, if he justified why there has to be a majority of judges on this council, without process and sanctions, that is hoping to exercise moral suasion. From where did this truth come and from which jurisdiction can examples be found to suggest that nobody is entitled to even a vague opinion that might lead to a moral injunction on judges other than judges themselves?</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked about the number of judges of which we are speaking. When we speak about a majority, how large will be this body? The net effect of all of this is simple. If the public votes &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, as the proposal is before us, it will make it more difficult to impeach a judge and, contrary to everything it hoped, those other behaviours short of impeachment will not be addressed. Quite extraordinarily, those who previously did not enjoy immunity will now have <Col N="113" /> conferred on them the same immunity as is held by the President.</P>
    <P>I lectured for 25 years in subjects that included the sociology of law. I read recently of a judge who decided to suspend a custodial sentence on a woman with five children until she had her baby. A decision like that is truly extraordinary and I shudder to think of the degree of ignorance about the necessity of bonding and so on that would arise in this case. It will not be possible to deliver sanction on such people and they will enjoy an immunity that a Supreme Court judge enjoyed previously. Where else does this happen in Europe? If we were talking about a District Justice or Circuit Court judge in Mafia ridden Italy, one would like to speak about their immunity from a political regime that might have been dubious on the issue of controlling crime but it is an extraordinary reflection on the public and on parliamentarians to introduce such legislation to achieve the opposite of the public's concern.</P>
    <P>There is no tension between judges operating with respect for the public who are respected, in turn, by parliamentarians. The division between the functions specified in the Constitution are not in trouble except that they have been provoked by recent events. What the public will ask when it goes to the polls to vote on the constitutional amendment is, how adequately does this deal with the events of the past two years? Unfortunately, it will see that the opposite of what was suggested then and what it expected is being proposed. I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to go back to first principles, take the advice of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and give time to this. Let us achieve something that respects all branches of our governorship</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Confused Ministers should be wary of putting referenda to the people. I say confused because it is increasingly clear that this Minister is unsure of himself and of the proposals that make up this Bill.</P>
      <P>The series of amendments he has introduced this evening of which, as usual, the media have been made aware before the House, only proves the point. On the radio on Sunday the Minister argued that a two thirds majority within the Oireachtas was a necessary precondition to ensure the separation of powers and to protect minority political rights within the House. He still believes that. Yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i> he wrote that no Government would or should attempt to push motions through the Dáil or the Seanad even under the existing simple majority constitutional provisions. These two views are contradictory. Which does the Minister believe? He might also explain why, if he believes something would not happen, he feels the need to legislate against it. There are enough problems which need to be addressed by legislation without wasting time legislating for those that even this most paranoid of Ministers does not believe will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> It is absurd that in the aftermath of the biggest judicial scandal in the history of the State, the Government should seek to make it harder to impeach a judge. This is what the Bill attempts to do. It is even more absurd that in the aftermath of two incomplete inquiries into that scandal, these proposals for constitutional amendment do not correct any of the deficiencies we encountered last year.</P>
    <P>After this referendum, which the Minster will attempt to persuade people is about introducing accountability with regard to the Judiciary, we will be left with only one option to deal with judicial misbehaviour &ndash; impeachment. This Bill is nonsense. There has not ever been an abuse of political power to impeach a judge since the foundation of the State. If ever the possibility existed that simple majority power might be used in this fashion it has probably receded. We all accept, however reluctantly by Fianna Fáil, that we live in an era of coalition Governments. If a minority party in Government can call the Taoiseach to account on personal pet projects like Stadium and Campus Ireland it might also be inclined to prevent partisan impeachment of a judge.</P>
    <P>Partisan impeachment would also be amenable to legal challenge. A growing number of Members of the House have experienced operating in a quasi-judicial capacity and the heavy responsibilities that brings. The idea that a whip might apply in an impeachment trial is a sure indication that impeachment could not be achieved. Whatever the faults of politicians, it is an insult to the Members of the Oireachtas to suggest that they would behave in such a partisan and unprincipled fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendments do not go to the heart of the problem of the Bill. They do not meet the concerns of the Labour Party although they may go some way to meeting those articulated by Fine Gael. If his amendments are enacted the bizarre situation could arise where 100 Members of the Dáil, assuming the motion was initiated in the Seanad, could vote for the removal of a judge and the motion would still fall. As we have seen from last year, even the threat of impeachment by a Government was sufficient to remove two judges in office. Now the Minister believes it is good law to put in to the Constitution that judges can remain in office despite a majority of the Members of Dáil Éireann advocating their impeachment. What is all this about?</P>
    <P>After the Minster's amendments, we are no clearer as to how the judicial council will operate. No Government legislation has been published, which is an outrage. Constitutional rather than statutory protection will prevail in relation to judges from lower courts, the judicial council will still have the power to make recommendations but the only real sanction will remain the nuclear option of impeachment.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the Minster's proposals is a worrying phenomenon. It is a simple lack of confidence in politics. His proposals send out a loud <Col N="115" /> and clear message that politics is not to be trusted and that politicians cannot act responsibly. The Minister is saying, or he has allowed others to convince him to say, that politicians need to be more protected against now, than at any stage in the history of the State. No doubt this is a view with some currency. It has recently been suggested to the sub-committee charged with investigating the Abbeylara affair that politicians are not sufficiently independent or the appropriate body to hold public servants to account. This is a dangerous precedent, regardless of to what extent politicians may have contributed to it.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to argue for the separation of powers in respect of judges whose function it is on occasion to legally hold the Executive to account but it is another thing altogether to advocate constitutional protection for lower court judges from politicians who have shown little or no inclination to interfere with them in the past. We are the elected representatives of the people. We are accountable to them and to each other. That is why my party proposes a code of conduct.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we have done much to cede power away from elected representatives and perhaps it is time to change that. I see no reason, for example, statutory agents should not be subjected to the same parliamentary question routine as Ministers but this Bill represents a bad start. There is only one precedent in 300 years on this island for the impeachment of a judge. By contrast, there is a recent precedent from last year of the administration of justice being damaged arising from questions surrounding judicial behaviour. For some reason the Minister appears to think it is his job to address the potential difficulty that could be caused by the former rather than the scandal of the latter. Having been a member of the Government that visited the latter issue upon us, perhaps it is not surprising.</P>
    <P>As it stands the Labour Party will be forced to oppose this Bill. We believe in the principle that greater accountability of the judges to the public is required. We do not believe they or the Garda require any further protections on that front. Part of the reasons we are debating these proposals is Fianna Fáil's difficulty with the concept of accountability. The party opposed the electoral reforms of the last decade. It opposed accountability within the House. The Minister is opposed not just to accountability within the Garda Síochána but to best practice in the force. At the last general election the party abandoned the previous Government's proposals for regional and accountable education boards. The Department of Education and Science continues to rule. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is intent on overriding local authorities' decisions without reflecting that the difficulty may be that local democracy is not only flawed but inadequate. Fianna Fáil appears to regard accountability as some terror drawn down upon it by the sins of its fathers. My party regards it as a necessary part of a maturing republic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> In recent weeks a newspaper editorial suggested it would be unfortunate to see this House and possibly the people divide on this issue. That is strange reasoning. We are told there are no differences between parties and people in this House and that we lack material for debate. Why recoil from genuine debate and difference when it emerges? We have recently inserted clauses into the Constitution to deal with fundamental issues, such as the right to remarry, which have received only the barest majorities. The Labour Party will oppose this Bill as published and if not amended by the Government we will oppose it in the country. We reject the proposed amendments but given the state of things more will probably be introduced tonight and tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it harder to impeach a judge and it affords judges of the minor courts the same constitutional protection as the President. It fails to resolve the issue of how judges guilty of misconduct can be sanctioned short of impeachment and it fails to provide for adequate non-judicial involvement in the limited procedures set out. The Bill will make a bad situation worse and it should be opposed.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also be subject to considerable confusion among the electorate. I made this point with regard to the Nice Treaty referendum. These referenda should be postponed until the autumn. We are putting four distinct proposals to an electorate that is increasingly busy and short of time. We have hardly adhered to our own recommendations for the length of time that should elapse between passing legislation in this House and holding a referendum. We are asking the electorate to take seriously the process of changing the Constitution. We have erred before in putting to the people a proposal on Cabinet confidentiality with which they felt unprepared to deal. I hope we do not repeat the mistake but sadly, I believe we will.</P>

      <P>Given due care and the right approach the Government had the opportunity to secure all party support for a Bill such as this. Regrettably given what it has introduced, such support cannot be forthcoming from this side of the House. It is incredible that the Government could put forward such provisions. The first really amazing provision is that where somebody wishes to lay a charge against or look for an investigation into the conduct of a judge then such notice of motion in the House requires the support of 30 Members. Seanad Éireann consists of 60 Members. It is impossible for the Government to expect this House to pass legislation which will require 30 Members of Seanad Éireann to sign such a resolution. Section 4 paragraph 4º contains &ldquo;A proposal to either House of the Oireachtas to prefer a charge against a judge under this section shall not be entertained unless upon a notice of motion in writing&rdquo; signed by not less than 30 Members of that House. To get 30 Members of Seanad Éireann to support such a resolution would be almost impossible. That provision will <Col N="117" /> have to be changed. It would be much better if it provided for somewhere in the region of ten or 15 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately ten people should be sufficient. It would not be correct for just one person to be allowed put down such a resolution. That could be damaging in many ways. We are on Second Stage of the Bill now and we will soon move to Committee Stage. We can discuss the numbers at a later stage. However, 30 people is too many and somewhere in the region of ten or 15 would be a more reasonable number. There will be a glorious opportunity to get such a number.</P>
      <P>Part 2, section 5 says that &ldquo;no such proposal shall be adopted by either of the Houses of the Oireachtas save upon a resolution of that House supported by not less than two thirds of the total membership thereof.&rdquo;  It is totally unnecessary to look for a two thirds majority. A simple majority as has been the case heretofore would be sufficient.</P>
      <P>The Minister circulated a briefing note which I found most interesting. It deals with the procedure similar to that which applies to the President but it was difficult to see where it was leading. It was not frank and open about what the Minister is attempting to do. For us to adopt the resolution to investigate, what is required is the use of a simple majority.</P>
      <P>With regard to the judicial body which it is proposed to establish in Part 2, section 1 &ldquo;Provision may be made by law for the establishment of a body to investigate, or cause to be investigated&rdquo;. It is essential to have such a body and I am in agreement with the establishment of such a body. I am also in favour of having a majority of judges on the body but the number of judges should be specified and clarified as should the number of lay people that are proposed.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service was established in 1998 and its board comprises representatives from the Bar Association, the Law Society, the Judiciary and members of the public. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board includes members of the Bar and solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any individual in court can feel he has been harshly treated by a judge. That person might not have been in court before and may well make representations to a TD or a Senator about his or her perceived justifiable grievance. The investigative procedure will then commence. It would be preferable to have a solicitor or a barrister to take the complaints because they are familiar with the courts and may have seen members of the public who have been harshly treated on occasions by judges. Those legal professionals could better outline the case to the investigating board. I will give a simple example. I have a reasonably good knowledge of the workings of the courts and in more than 40 years working as a solicitor, I have <Col N="118" /> not ever dealt with a case where a person was committed to prison for contempt of court. The Minister also has a long-established legal practice and I do not know if he has ever encountered anyone being cited for contempt of court, be it a solicitor, barrister, a garda or a member of the public. However, there are a few judges, one in particular, who quite frequently commits people for contempt of court. Some judges seem to be unable to conduct proceedings without having to use the ultimate sanction of committal to prison. That sort of situation should be investigated and a judicial body would be a suitable forum. Everyone, solicitor, barrister, member of the public, should be entitled to come to court and be allowed outline their cases without being cited for contempt of court and sent to prison.</P>
    <P>I have served in all branches of the courts over the years and I have found that 99% of the judges are courteous, fair and reasonable. They have made excellent decisions, although on occasions I have not seen the reasoning behind some decisions especially when I was on the opposing side. No matter how a judge arrives at a decision, some people will still feel aggrieved. Overall our system to date has worked reasonably well. There have been difficulties and problems and some people appointed as judges at a young age become more difficult as the years go by. The investigating body and the procedures outlined will be important but they cannot be put before the people without amendments. I ask the Minister to ensure that there will be a representative from the Law Society and the Bar Council on the body.</P>

If the Minister fails on either of those issues it is a serious matter for all of us. We must be careful to maintain standards here and in the Judiciary. Sadly this Bill is not presented in a manner that would allow us to accept it as proposed. I am dissatisfied but I would like to hear further from the Minister. We are obliged to oppose the Bill.</P>

He would be better off to go back to Kerry, stay down there and look for the people who, he said while on this side of the House, would rear up from the ditches to commit crime during my watch.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with serious legislation when we decide to put a referendum to the people to change our Constitution, on which the sovereignty of the State is founded and from which all our laws on judges, their conduct and all human rights for our people emanate. The Minister published a referendum Bill on something as serious as an examination of judicial conduct but did not publish the draft Bill that will be put in place. He is asking the people to take him at his word, that he will do something good after it is passed, it is only the Constitution and they do not understand it. They should vote yes because it sounds like a good idea. How dare the Minister treat the people and Members in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today, at the eleventh and a half hour, we hear the Minister has briefed the media that he intends to introduce amendments to this legislation, which will be available tomorrow morning, when this House is supposed to pass the legislation following Committee Stage. The two Opposition spokespersons may have got a preliminary brief<Col N="120" /> ing. I had a moment to speak with our spokesman, Deputy Shatter&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>After the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to get some idea of what the Minister is proposing. What the Minister is proposing ,and the manner in which he is doing it, is inadequate and unsatisfactory and Fine Gael will not support his legislation. It is not that anybody in this House does not consider that the 1937 Constitution needs to be amended to deal with judicial conduct as opposed to judicial decisions. We believe a constitutional referendum is needed to ensure judges are called to account if they behave in the way two judges, former Judge O'Flaherty and former Judge Cyril Kelly, behaved last year. It almost brought down the Government. We need change but this is not the way to go about it. What has the Minister been doing between November 1998 when Susan Denham published her report and December 1999 when the All-Party Committee on the Constitution published its report? The Minister had time between November 1998 and December 1999 to consider this issue. He was afraid to implement the findings of the 1998 report of Susan Denham's committee. I agree that some of the suggestions might not be the right way to go about it. Suddenly, a referendum Bill is published to make this change to the Constitution. What is wrong with waiting another few months to ensure we get the legislation correct and until he has had time to publish the amending legislation that will follow on the passage of this referendum? How dare the Minister treat this country and parliament as no more than a rubber stamp and then go off into his hiding hole to decide on the legislation?</P>
      <P>Despite his proposed amendments, which we are only hearing about on the wind, he has taken on board that the two-thirds majority needed to commence the procedure will now be a simple majority and he has reduced from 30 to 20 the number of Members required to table the motion to start the procedure. That is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has made no changes to the section which refers to the so-called &ldquo;body&rdquo;, whatever it will do and whatever it will represent. There is no detail about the people who will be on it. My colleague, Deputy Shatter, has already raised many questions concerning it. How many members will form the body? Who will be responsible for appointing the members of the body? Will it be the Minister or some independent group? Will they be self-selected? Who will be responsible for appointing one or more persons who are not judges? What kind of people will be selected? What factors will render a judge or a non-judge eligible for appointment to the body? What qualifications are required? Should their past record be examined to ensure they are impartial? Perhaps they have been involved in some business where they have no choice but to be partial about certain things and, therefore, will not be able to exercise impar<Col N="121" /> tiality if a complaint of misconduct comes before them.</P>
    <P>I am flabbergasted at the Minister's effrontery to this House. He went out this evening at 6.30, called in his friends in the media and made it sound as if he was listening to the views of this House and was coming to a final agreement. It is a disgrace that he had to do that at this last hour when he should have been listening to a more prolonged proper debate on this legislation and on a draft Bill that will be put in place when eventually the referendum is passed. The Minister's behaviour is such that if he had a decent Taoiseach who understood what being a Minister was about, he would tell him to pack his bag, take the flight back to Kerry and look after his constituency by ensuring the Independent Member, Deputy Healy-Rae, does not do too much damage to his prospects of a seat in the next election.</P>
    <P>I am even more surprised by the Minister's actions in view of the fact that he is a member of the legal profession. I agree with Deputy Enright. There is no mention of members of the legal profession having a say in the judicial council. We are in favour of a judicial council. There are good ideas in the recommendations of the all party Oireachtas committee and of Justice Susan Denham's committee. The Minister's response, however, is like a camel's committee. He has picked bits here and there but not in any consistent way.</P>
    <P>Complaints about the Judiciary and its members' conduct can originate from members of the legal profession. I have often heard legal people say that if a judge takes a scunner against one, it is not the solicitor or barrister who will suffer but their client. If justice is to be done and seen to be done, no personal animosity should exist between a judge and the representing counsel or solicitor because that would defy other elements of the Constitution which guarantee people the right to a defence. There must be impartiality in that. The Minister has not even given consideration to that.</P>
    <P>I am proud to have been the Minister who set up the Courts Commission under Justice Susan Denham. She did great work on the commission which led to the Courts Service for which the Minister, because he is in office, takes the credit. I am big enough to accept that the Minister is entitled to claim that the Courts Service was a good idea. However, he is failing the work of Justice Denham and those who set up the Courts Service and made it work without any of the tensions that might have arisen. When I established the working group I ensured there was a good cross section of people in the group to look at all aspects of the courts service. It included judges, lay people, consumers and members of the legal profession and we had a rounded view of how the Courts Service should be established. Where is that now?</P>
    <P>It is as if the Minister took the two reports, threw them up in the air and if something jumped off a page when it was open, he grabbed it and <Col N="122" /> various other bits. He has made a dog's dinner of this legislation. That is the only way to describe it. It will be of no help to Members of the Oireachtas or the Judiciary. I do not believe members of the Judiciary will gain anything if the Minister proceeds in this manner. If there is serious misconduct, as there was last year, it will be extremely hard to impeach a judge. The Minister has set the hurdles at such a point where, even with the proposed changes, the Oireachtas will never be able to impeach a judge if Members consider that necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not take on board the recommendation that there should be other sanctions against judges. If a judge is being examined by an Oireachtas committee or sub-committee, we do not know if he or she will continue to act in the court, if they should step back or if they will be paid. If they win their case, as it were, and are not impeached, what happens to their service record if they were suspended while the hearing continued? The public knows nothing about those details. Members of the House who are charged with passing the legislation know nothing about them because we cannot see inside the Minister's head, which seems to be a large lump of fudge on this issue.</P>
    <P>I am extremely shocked. The Minister is a clever man. I sat on the Government benches and listened to some of his clever speeches. However, he has shown no cleverness in this case. In fact, he will rue the day if he forges ahead with this. He should stop now while he has the opportunity. My party is not fundamentally opposed to a constitutional amendment to ensure there is an effective way of dealing with judicial misconduct short of necessarily going through the process of impeachment. The Minister should take advantage of the willingness on this side of the House to make a proper amendment to the Constitution. He should pause and take heed of what we say. If he rushes forward with this amendment, he will rue the day. On many occasions the Minister said the same to me, and to other Ministers, from these Opposition benches, advising us to pause, take our time and ensure that what we were doing was right.</P>
    <P>Even if 31 May has been selected for holding other referenda there is no need for this Minister to get a piece of the action. He can take a backseat. There is no need to be out there saying: &ldquo;Me too; I want to have my referendum too so I am not outside the loop&rdquo;. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, is responsible for one referendum and if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has leadership ambitions he might fear that Deputy Cowen will go ahead of him in the leadership stakes because he will be conducting his referendum. However, there is no need for this Minister to be involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows only too well after his three years in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that something rushed can be a mistake. He must know from his discussions with the judges that they are not happy with what he <Col N="123" /> is doing. They would like to know the details. The legislation differs from what they recommend so they will not be happy with it. Nobody will be happy and I am shocked the Minister has proceeded with it. He has announced he will make some minor amendments, such as reduce the number of people required to sign the motion from 30 to 20 and reduce the two-thirds majority requirement to commence the procedures to a simple majority. I agree with the two-thirds requirement for final impeachment&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we must be careful to ensure there is a general consensus about impeaching a judge. It is a major step. I would prefer a simple majority requirement to get the process going and, if necessary, a two-thirds majority for impeachment. If the House establishes the procedure properly, a two-thirds majority could be secured ultimately. The Minister's way of going about it is not correct.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister, in considering the issues that have been raised by many speakers during this short debate, will recognise that the body he intends to establish comes nowhere near the concept proposed by Fine Gael or the Labour Party. If he hopes to have some form of unanimity on what he is doing, he should pause and listen to what we say.</P>
      <P>The all party Oireachtas committee made recommendations and, in some instances, the Minister went along with its views. However, it made more wide ranging recommendations about a judicial council which the Minister has ignored. He cherry picked a few bits and pieces of the recommendations and left out others. The Minister has taken the liberty, at this late stage, of coming to the House to ballyrag and bulldoze us. He will probably go on the airwaves in the morning to talk about the wonderful job he has done: &ldquo;I have made the amendments and that is what they asked for&rdquo;. It is one of the changes we sought but not all of them.</P>
      <P>We are not playing the politics games the Minister used to play when he was on this side of the House. This issue is far too serious for the Minister to laugh at us and say that we do not know what we want and that we are divided among ourselves. Of course, there is a difference of opinion among Members but it is the Minister's responsibility to bring those differences as close together as possible so that, at the end of the day, all Members can claim they have done a good job and given the people the right referendum on which to vote. If it is their choice to select it, they will know what they are buying into and what will happen when the legislation is passed. At present, however, they are confronted with a pig in the poke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could try to use all the cliches at which the Minister was so good when he was on the Opposition benches but I could not possibly match <Col N="124" /> them. The Minister is making a mistake in rushing this legislation through. I strongly recommend, as a former Minister for Justice, that the Minister take heed of what is being said in this debate and that he not proceed with this amendment.</P>
    <P>I would like to be a fly on the wall and listen to some of the discussions in the Department as I believe there is no wholehearted support for what the Minister is doing. He decided it was time for a referendum because of the embarrassment of the O'Flaherty and Kelly case and the damage that did to the Government. He felt he would get this off the agenda and push it through. A proper Committee Stage debate would have allowed us to tease out the Department officials' view of difficulties with what the Minister is proposing. As I say, tóg go bog é; the Minister should not include this referendum with the others on 31 May. He should give us time to consider this in the autumn. There is no need to rush it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed. I am not in a position to accept all the suggestions which have been made in the course of the debate but on Committee Stage tomorrow I shall propose some amendments to the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter suggested that a simple majority should suffice to prefer a charge against a judge, with a two-thirds majority being necessary to sustain the charge and remove the judge from office. The Deputy made the point, with which I agree, that if a serious allegation is made against a judge which a majority of either the Dáil or Seanad believe should be investigated, the public interest demands that such an investigation occur. For this reason I will propose a Committee Stage amendment to provide that a simple majority of the membership will be sufficient to prefer a charge. Having considered the views which have been expressed in this debate, I believe that to require a two-thirds majority to prefer a charge is unduly restrictive. Since the preferring of a charge can give rise to the suspension of a judge and the decisions to prefer a charge and to suspend are taken by the same House, I will also propose an amendment to provide that decisions to impose or lift a suspension will be taken by simple majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement that at least 30 Members of a House are needed to sign a motion proposing that a charge be preferred was also the subject of comment by Deputies. This requirement is taken from the impeachment provision for the President which both the Constitution Review Group and the all-party committee recommended should also be applied to judges. The change from a two-thirds to a simple majority requirement to prefer a charge, which I am proposing, makes the requirement for 30 Members to sign the motion inappropriate in the case of the Seanad where 31 Members will suffice to pass the motion. Having considered this point, which was well made by <Col N="125" /> Deputy Enright, I have decided to table an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that 20 Members may table a motion in either House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin and others have argued for a simple majority requirement for the removal of a judge. It is argued that the existing power to remove from office has never been used and so is unlikely to be abused in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>However, a two-thirds majority requirement will effectively remove the possibility that such decisions will be taken solely with the support of the Government parties and against the wishes of the Opposition. Deputy Howlin appears to see nothing wrong with a situation in which a judge would be removed following a divisive debate polarised along Government and Opposition lines. I consider that this would be a very harmful prospect which would inevitably lessen confidence in the independent administration of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Security of tenure is a necessary corollary of the independence of the Judiciary and if a judge is to be removed from office it should be only in circumstances where there is a broad level of consensus in the Houses of the Oireachtas following the proper procedure, that this is the appropriate course of action. The Deputy also points out that if a judge were removed from office for purely partisan reasons, the decision could be struck down by the courts. He may be correct in this but such a scenario, namely a stand-off between possibly the Dáil on the one hand and the High and Supreme Courts on the other, is surely not one that we should welcome. Indeed, it would not be unreasonable to describe it as a constitutional crisis, an outcome which the Deputy wrongly says my proposals would bring about. We should not enact measures which rely as a safeguard on the possibility of the High or Supreme Courts striking down a resolution of this House to remove a judge. I prefer to have as a safeguard a provision which effectively means that Opposition support will be necessary to remove a judge. That is a very important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate, Deputies sought details of the composition of the body to be set up pursuant to the new Article 35.4. !t was also argued that the Bill to set up this body should have been published in draft form at the same time as the Bill to amend the Constitution. While it is true that there are precedents for this, the divorce referendum, for example, there is no compelling reason this should be done in the present case. It is proposed to insert a power in the Constitution to set up a particular body whose role is stated, very specifically, in the proposed constitutional amendment. This is what the people will be voting on, not the detailed Bill <Col N="126" /> which will follow, and which it will be fully within the competence of the Oireachtas to debate, amend if necessary, and enact. In any event, my Department will continue to work on the necessary primary legislation consistent with progressing the other urgent legislation for which it is responsible.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not accept any criticism for not having published a Bill, It is appropriate to give a broad outline to the House of the main provisions which will be included in the legislation which will be introduced to establish, <i>inter alia,</i> the body referred to in Article 35.4. The legislation will, in addition to providing the legislative framework for the establishment and operation of that body, also provide for the establishment of a judicial council on the lines recommended in the Report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the legislation will be that it will provide for the establishment of a judicial council made up of all members of the Judiciary. The functions of the council will be carried out through the agency of a board and committees. The council will deal with matters such as ethical standards, training of judges and general issues affecting the conduct of judicial business. It will not, however, have any role in the investigation of allegations or complaints against individual judges.</P>
    <P>Complaints against individual members of the Judiciary will be dealt with by a committee of the council to be known as the committee on conduct and ethics. This committee will constitute the body referred to in Article 35.4. It will have the power to investigate complaints of misbehaviour or incapacity by judges and it will be conferred with the powers necessary to do this. Provision will be made for the classification of complaints and for an inquiry into more serious complaints to be heard in public.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the committee on conduct and ethics will have a membership of 12. Deputy Enright referred to this and asked for details of the membership. There will be eight judges, the four Court Presidents, four ordinary judges and four lay persons or non-judges. The legal profession will be represented as part of the non-judge membership. The other lay persons might be nominated by the Government for a term of years or could be <i>ex officio</i> members holding certain other public offices.</P>
    <P>It will be open to any member of the public to make a complaint to the committee on conduct and ethics and have it considered. Serious complaints would be referred by the committee to a panel of inquiry which could consist of either one judge or a number of judges with lay representation.</P>
    <P>The committee will also be empowered to make and publish findings and recommendations arising from an investigation.</P>

      <P>Deputies raised the point that the Article 35.4 body will investigate only behaviour that is alleged to have occurred while the person was in office as a judge. It does not cover behaviour that occurs prior to appointment but has only been discovered subsequent to appointment. For example, a person might have been engaged in major tax evasion prior to appointment as a judge. Deputy Shatter saw an inconsistency between this and the position under the new Article 35.5. It is clear that Article 35.4 only applies to behaviour while holding the office of judge. I do not propose that the body will be empowered to investigate conduct which occurs prior to the person assuming the office of judge. The competence of this body, which will consist mostly of judges, is in the area of conduct which takes place while a person is a judge. The body can decide what is appropriate in that context and make findings and recommendations in relation to it. If wrongdoing which took place before a judge is appointed is of concern, for example, if a judge is guilty of major tax evasion &ndash; the example given by Deputy Shatter &ndash; it is likely that impeachment is the only appropriate course of action that could be considered.</P>
      <P>Deputies argued that, since it was proposed only to give power to the body to make and publish findings and recommendations, it could not issue reprimands to judges. I believe that the power to make and publish findings and recommendations, in effect, amounts to a power to reprimand.</P>

      <P>We should also remember that the all-party committee was recommending a body which would have a constitutional basis and yet it favoured moral as distinct from legal sanctions. It would not be appropriate to give the body power to impose penalties such as a period <Col N="129" /> of suspension or a fine as this could fatally damage the authority of the judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If such a course of action were warranted, I suggest that the impeachment route would need to be considered. Deputy Shatter outlined Fine Gael's ideas on a judicial board which would have an equal number of legal and non-legal members. However, the provision in my proposal that a majority of the body be judges is the key guarantee of judicial independence. It closely reflects the recommendations of the constitutional review group, the all-party committee and the judicial conduct and ethics committee, none of which envisaged that judges would be in anything other than a majority on the body.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that a judge should be suspended automatically if either House votes by a majority for a charge to be preferred. Deputy Shatter said that the body to be set up under the new Article 35.4 should have a constitutional power to suspend but I do not agree with automatic suspension. It should be open to the House preferring the charge to decide whether suspension is warranted in a particular case. Nothing is lost by leaving this decision to the House. There must be a power to lift suspension if circumstances change before the investigating House concludes its investigation.</P>
      <P>I believe that it would be excessive to give the Article 35.4 body the power to suspend. All matters relating to removing a judge from office, including requiring him not to exercise judicial functions while an investigation is under way, should be confined to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise how important legislation would have been to spell this out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, such a power is not necessary in the hands of the Article 35.4 body as if a judge is seriously and obviously misbehaving it can be expected that one of the Houses will act forthwith, prefer a charge and invoke its power of suspension under the proposed Article 35.5, if necessary. Deputies raised the question of the interaction between the new body and the impeachment powers of the Oireachtas and asked for this to be clarified. For example, if impeachment proceedings are undertaken for the same behaviour as was investigated by the body, can the members of the body be required to come before the House to give evidence of the investigative process and explain any recommendations made?</P>
      <P>I dealt with this issue on Second Stage when I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>impeachment proceedings might arise out of an investigation by the body provided for by the new section 4 but they could also arise at <Col N="130" /> the initiative of either House. Where the Article 35.4 body has investigated misbehaviour and issued a report recommending impeachment, the question arises as to whether the investigating House of the Oireachtas can accept that report and act on it. The fact that a comprehensive report is already available to the House could well have the effect of shortening the investigation which the House needs to undertake or cause to have undertaken but there can be no question of the House being circumscribed in relation to how it carries out its role. In any event, the judge has to be given the opportunity of responding to the charge against him or her including the findings of the Article 35.4 body. This is an inevitable implication of the supremacy of the Houses in this matter: the decision that a judge should be removed from office cannot be devolved in whole or in part to another body.</P>
    <P>The House could prefer a charge on the basis of an allegation which has already been investigated by the Article 35.4 body even if the body did not recommend impeachment. This is because the powers of the Houses should not be diminished in any way merely because a new body is being established. It will be possible to call members of the body before the House to give evidence about the investigation they have carried out because the House's power to investigate is not limited in the proposed wording.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party takes issue with the proposed guarantee of security of tenure at constitutional level for judges of the Circuit and District Courts. In my opening speech, I explained the reasons for this proposal. In particular, I am advised that security of tenure is already effectively guaranteed to judges of the lower courts at constitutional level because any amendment to the existing statutory provisions which negatively affected their independence as judges would implicitly be constitutionally invalid.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin criticises the proposed new body on the grounds that it can only deal with misbehaviour and incapacity. It will not be allowed to consider if a judge is guilty of a less serious charge such as incompetence or inefficiency. According to the Deputy, the grounds for investigation by the new body are confined to misbehaviour or incapacity, the very grounds for which impeachment is the sanction. The Deputy may be mistaken in considering all misbehaviour as of a type which would justify impeachment and removal from office. There is a range of possible misbehaviour by a judge but only that which, in the opinion of the House, renders the judge unfit to continue in office justifies his removal.</P>
      <P>Misbehaviour of a lesser kind can be dealt with by the new body. Incompetence and inefficiency, unless they arise out of misbehaviour or incapacity, are not included.</P>

      <Col N="133" /> At the commencement of this debate on 10 April, I said we should debate this Bill by reference to two essential criteria: first, it must provide fair and workable measures to deal with judicial misbehaviour which served to enhance public confidence in the administration of justice; and second, it must maintain and support the independence of judges in carrying out their duties. This Bill, with the addition of the amendments I have outlined and which I will propose on Committee Stage, meets these objectives in a balanced way.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism here this evening regarding the perceived delay in some quarters at putting forward the Government amendments which have been laid before the House. While I regret that the amendments were not ready earlier, Fine Gael is proposing extensive amendments to the legislation and I understand they were submitted so late this evening that the Bills Office is still working on them.</P>

There can be little doubt but that any objective observer looking in on this debate would know that the members of the Opposition have contributed, by and large, without regard for the very serious issues which are before the House. I regard it as deeply disturbing and regrettable that certain leading members of the Opposition parties, in particular, the Labour Party, would seek to make a political football out of the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht go dtí an Teach chun an cheist thábhachtach seo a phlé. Is gá don Aire Oideachais agus Eolais maoiniú iomlán a chur ar fáil maidir leis an bhfoirgneamh nua do Ghaelscoil Róis, i gCarraig Mhachaire Róis, Condae Muineacháin. Ní chóir go bhfanfadh seisear mhúinteoir agus 126 dalta sa tseanfhoirgneamh ina bhfuil siad faoi láthair. Iarraim ar an Aire, ar son na ndaltaí, na múinteoirí, na dtuismitheoirí agus ar son fhoireann uilig na scoile maoiniú iomlán a chur ar fáil.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, for coming into the house this evening to address this very important issue. Gaelscoil Róis, Carrickmacross, is one of the hundreds of gaelscoileanna which have blossomed throughout the length and breadth of Ireland over the past 20 years. I pay tribute to the dedicated team of people, teachers, parents, committee members and management who are providing an excellent Irish medium education to young people in Carrickmacross. The excellent work of all concerned in Scoil Róis is a battle against the odds because they have to operate in a building that is nothing short of a disgrace. It is no consolation that it is an historic building built in 1775 to accommodate 40 pupils and one teacher. It now has 126 pupils and six teachers and they are operating in dangerous and overcrowded conditions.</P>
      <P>The use of this completely unsuitable building as a school should be consigned to history. The main door of the school opens directly on to the main N2 roadway, one of the busiest roads in the country. As well as the hazard to pupils coming to and going from the school there is the incessant noise of passing traffic which intrudes on the classrooms. The school yard is prone to flooding, there are hazardous steps and other signs of dilapidation are in evidence in this very old building. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Martin, visited the school and saw for himself the totally unacceptable conditions. The provision of a new school building for gael scoil Róis is long overdue. The school seeks from the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, a firm guarantee that the new building will go ahead as scheduled starting this July. A new site in Cloughvalley, Carrickmacross, was purchased from Monaghan County Council by the Department of Education and Science and it has full planning permission.</P>
      <P>The current delay is due to concerns about the site itself, of which the Department was aware from the beginning. If extra cost is involved in preparing the site, it was adequately offset by the favourable price charged by Monaghan County Council, which is very much in favour of having Gaelscoil Róis accommodated in a new premises away from the N2. I urge the Minister to ensure that all the necessary costs are met and that the building proceeds without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> Gaelscoil Róis is a vital part of the vibrant community of Carrickmacross, and, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will concur, is at the centre of new growth and development in a long neglected region. The Minister and his Department must play their part to ensure that the school can operate in decent conditions and continues to blossom.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht an t-ábhar seo a árdú. Aithnímid go léir go bhfuil fás, borradh agus bláth tar éis teacht ar na gaelscoileanna ar fud na tíre. Fáiltím roimhe sin mar cuireann sé go mór leis an gcultúr, ní hamháin sna scoileanna féin ach ins na ceantair ina bhfuil siad suite. Tuigim go maith go bhfuil suim, ní hamháin agat féin, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in ábhar mar seo ach ag an Teachta, ach go háirithe. Tá áthas orm gur thug sé an deis dom anocht an staid mar atá sé ag an Roinn faoi láthair maidir leis an scoil seo, Gaelscoil Róis, i gCarraig Mhachaire Róis i gCondae Muineacháin a shoiléiriú, féachaint isteach sa scéal agus insint don Teach conas mar atá an scéal faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Faoi láthair is é an leibhéal foirne, príomh oide, cúigear rang oide, maraon le hoide feabhais. Bhí 126 dalta cláraithe ar an 30 Meán Fómhair 2000 agus tá dul chun cinn maith déanta faoi láthair ar phleanáil ailtireachta ar thionscadal chun scoil nua le sé sheomra ranga a sholáthar do Ghaelscoil Róis.</P>
      <P>Because of the progress made in bringing the project for the six new classroom school to an advanced stage of architectural planning, the Department's technical staff are urgently examining up to date costings which were recently received from the schools design team. They increased the money required to make the site suitable for construction of the school. The Department must ensure that the costings are warranted.</P>
      <P>The extent of the additional costs will soon be clarified and a decision then taken on when the project may proceed. To avoid delay, the Department, following an advertisement, pre-qualified a list of contractors who are interested in tendering for it. The project will proceed as quickly as possible to construction. The Department of Education and Science is committed to the provision of a new school for Gaelscoil Róis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night a 15 year old boy spent his second night in a Garda station cell because there was no room for him at a special school in Dublin. The same boy last winter was found without footwear sleeping in an abandoned car. Earlier yesterday, the Children's Court ordered that the boy be retained at the unit in Oberstown, <Col N="146" /> Lusk, but when taken there by gardaí, he was refused entry because the centre was full and so he was taken to a Garda station. Today the case came before the High Court which ruled that the boy should be freed from Garda custody.</P>
      <P>Because of this ruling the media focus will lessen. However, the support and help that he needs will not be provided by the State. I ask the Minister of State if she knows where this boy will be accommodated tonight. Has she made any inquiries, and is she taking steps to ensure that his needs are being catered for? What steps are being taken to ensure that he does not become the focus of news headlines in a few months time because there is still no place where he can be cared for appropriately?</P>
      <P>The case of a boy of 13, who suffers from attention deficit disorder, highlights this Government's failings. His mother sought help from the Northern Area Health Board but has not received any offers of a place. He lived rough in a park in recent months and had come under the influence of older men. His mother feared that he now was using alcohol and cannabis. There was no appropriate place nor an appropriate response from the State.</P>
      <P>Garda stations and park benches are neither suitable nor acceptable places for disturbed teenagers. At a time of unprecedented wealth, it is beyond a disgrace that vulnerable children are treated like this. Last October when Ministers were threatened with contempt of court proceedings over their failure to find a suitable place for a disturbed girl, the Minister of State with responsibility for children appeared on practically every available media slot outlining how she would ensure proper care facilities for children at risk. Six months later, we are not much better off. More children are sleeping rough and those requiring specialist care are not getting it.</P>
      <P>There was a recruitment drive for specialist staff to work with disturbed children, but it is only now that attention is given to the appalling wages paid in that sector. It would have made more sense to review the wage rates before the recruitment drive began.</P>
      <P>The suitability and availability of care places remains a serious problem. Most detention places and high support units are full, and neither do they offer the most suitable care for particular problems suffered by children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the problem of the lack of sufficient inspection of child care institutions. To ensure that proper child care is administered, a well staffed inspectorate is needed to enforce the highest standards. I refer to the need to ensure adequate staff in the social services inspectorate, but, more importantly, within the health boards. The latest figures from the ERHA show that only 26% of its residential care units were inspected and a smaller proportion of such units are regis<Col N="147" /> tered. Lessons must be learned from the Newtown House report.</P>
    <P>We await the promised legislation for the establishment of an ombudsman for children. The Government attracted much publicity by announcing it would establish this office. Intentions alone will not serve the interests of the children sleeping in doorways, on park benches and in Garda stations tonight. If the Taoiseach could exercise the same vigour in tackling the problems facing disturbed children as he does towards developing a national sports stadium, there would be fewer children arriving in our courts daily. I ask the Minister of State what she is doing to cater for this 15 and 13 year old who were before the courts recently. What provision has she made to meet their urgent needs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this important issue. I share her concerns about a number of matters she raised. However, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases of children who have come before the courts. I am aware of the circumstances of the cases that were reported in the media and I assure the House of my commitment and that of the Government to providing appropriate services for such children.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to &lsquo;at risk' children is evidenced by the measures contained in the Children Bill, 1999, published by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, which is now due to go to Report Stage. The Bill, when enacted, will repeal the Children Act, 1908, and will set out a blueprint for a new juvenile justice system.</P>
      <P>In addition to updating the provisions relating to young persons who have been sentenced by the courts, including the obligations of the centres under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science, the Bill provides for a wide range of early interventions and non-custodial alternatives to cater for children coming into conflict with the law or with serious care needs. While the Bill places emphasis on custody being a last resort, it is accepted that for those who do require custody, suitable places have to be available. To this end, both the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, through the health boards, have embarked on major capital programmes to upgrade and expand the range of places available for such children. The Government has committed more than £90 million extra for the development of child welfare services through the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of health board high support and special care places for non-offending children increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 83, which includes the Ballydowd special care unit being opened on a phased basis. Plans are under <Col N="148" /> way to develop an additional 56 places nationally as follows. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the construction of a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane is progressing. The Midland Health Board, the North-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus. In the Mid-Western Health Board area, ten high support places and five special care places for adolescent boys are being developed. In the Southern Health Board area, a five place high support unit for boys is being developed. These places are due to become available within 12 months.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new career and salary structures agreed in the past fortnight with IMPACT after a year of work by the working group, will help not only to attract new people into this career but to retain staff and encourage those who are not qualified to pursue qualifications.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has responsibility for the five centres providing residential accommodation for young people up to the age of 16 who are placed on remand or sentenced to detention by the courts. Development plans have been drawn up by that Department to meet the obligations that will arise under the new legislation. These plans provide for the major refurbishment and updating of the existing facilities at Trinity House, Lusk, and St. Laurence's, Finglas; the phased replacement of the existing outdated facilities at St. Michael's, Finglas, and Oberstown boys and girls centres; the development of new pre-release units to serve the Finglas and Lusk centres; and the development of a new highly specialised secure unit at the Lusk campus.</P>
    <P>The overall development programme will extend over the next three to four years. Already, the new pre-release unit at Finglas has been completed and is in operation for over a year. Pre-release facilities for the Lusk campus will be come on stream in autumn this year. The major refurbishment of two units at Trinity House has also been completed. The planning of the new secure unit at Lusk is nearing completion and tenders will be invited shortly. Planning for the new national remand and assessment centre to replace the existing St. Michael's at Finglas is also at an advanced stage and tenders for the construction of this project will be invited later this summer. Arrangements are currently under way for the appointment of a further design team for the replacement of the Oberstown units on a phased basis over the next three to four years.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, in order to keep the Oberstown centres in operation, it has been necessary to carry out urgent major refurbishment works on the existing units. This has resulted in their capacity being significantly reduced over the past number of months. The work is now nearing com<Col N="149" /> pletion and it is expected that the centre will be able to operate at full capacity later this month.</P>
    <P>From time to time difficulties arise with accommodating placements for individual children on the first date on which placement is sought in any particular unit due to pressure on places on a given day. In general, the child in these circumstances is either subsequently placed in that unit or in one of the other facilities as an alternative to or pending the availability of a place in the original unit of preference. Regrettably, in exceptional cases, some children have been held in Garda stations.</P>
    <P>With the development of new places, the Children Bill, the alternative measures which have been put in place, the special residential services board, the expansion of the social services inspectorate with the appointment of a new permanent chief inspector and an additional inspector being recruited, and the Ombudsman legislation about to be published &ndash; it is over a year since I brought it to Government and I have been guaranteed it will be published in the next few months &ndash; there will be major changes in the provision of services for children. Real progress has been made but I accept much remains to be done.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Restrictions on Sale of Livestock.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister. There is an enormous mismatch building up on farms as regards resources and needs. There are many dairy farms carrying young stock they would not normally carry at this time. There are also a great many suckler farms which are carrying livestock they would not normally carry, and there are many other farms which at this time of year would normally be selling yearlings but which are now carrying that stock.</P>
      <P>On dairy and suckler farms the stock are eating what would be normally the first crop of silage for this year, which will prejudice the ability of those farms to carry stock through the winter. There are people in restricted areas who have cattle and sheep which should have been sold and slaughtered at various times over the past eight weeks. However, those animals, which are still on farms and must be fed and cared for, are now losing condition. When it is finally possible to sell them they will be worth a great deal less than normal.</P>
      <P>I do not know the Minister's view on the situation facing us in the beef and sheep sectors, but many on this side of the House and in the farming sector feel we are faced with a very bad period in terms of markets. I am sure the Minister agrees. This will exacerbate the difficulties faced by people who have been unable to get animals off their farms when they were in the proper condition to be marketed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances we must examine the <Col N="150" /> possibility which may exist to allow some resumption of normal trading in livestock. I know there are risks. The expert committee that advises the Minister believes there are risks, a view shared by him. However, I want to see a public and realistic assessment of those risks, which vary from zero risk to risks we should clearly avoid. In terms of zero risk, it is clear that animals on a farm which is clear of foot and mouth can be moved without constituting a risk to other susceptible animals.</P>
    <P>I contend there is no risk in moving livestock from a disease free farm to farms where currently there are no livestock, and more so to farms where there has been no livestock since before the first outbreak of foot and mouth in England. If livestock can be moved from a farm where there is a shortage of feed to one where there is a shortage of animals to use the feed available, then it is not a risk and we should allow movement. If it is possible to find farms where there is not any risk, where there is not any disease, where on one side there is an over-abundance of livestock and on the other a shortage, then it seems that is a situation of very low risk. After that we can imagine a whole series of scenarios where the risk increases. I would like to see, in public, some evidence that that range of possibilities is being considered. I heard this evening as I was returning here from a meeting with farmers in the Cooley peninsula that the expert committee had looked at this and decided this was not yet the time, without any further explanation.</P>
    <P>A great many farmers in the Cooley peninsula have been restricted and have livestock on their farms that would have been ready for slaughter many times in the past eight weeks. They are now unable to move the stock. I want the Minister to consider putting in place, between now and the end of June &ndash; the end of the purchase for destruct scheme &ndash; a system under which livestock from farms in that area can be prioritised under that scheme so that we can at least save part of the income those farmers would normally have generated over recent months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes and his colleagues who put their names to this motion, which is an important one. Earlier today I announced a number of adjustments to the foot and mouth disease restrictions. These will be of some help to farmers. The adjustments address at least some of the concerns expressed by Deputies here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the specific issues raised by the Deputies, I will briefly describe the position in Ireland as of today. The first outbreak of foot and mouth disease took place in Proleek, County Louth on 22 March. That is 40 days ago. The reason for nervousness in the Department and among the expert group is that in Northern Ireland, two outbreaks occurred after 44 days <Col N="151" /> without one. It will be still some days yet before we can relax a number of the restrictions. It is good news that we have reached a number of deadlines without a further outbreak, particularly in the context of County Louth farmers because they made the greatest sacrifice for the country as a whole. If there is any way we can be of assistance to them we will. I will consider Deputy Dukes's suggestion that they should be given priority under the purchase for destruct scheme to see if it would be helpful to them.</P>
    <P>However, it is essential that we continue to be cautious. There is still some tracing to be done in relation to animals that came into the jurisdiction, albeit before 21 February. Some conclusions have yet to be reached. The Garda Síochána and a special unit in the Department are still following a number of leads. As well as that, 65 flocks are at present restricted as a precautionary measure around different parts of the country. Results from Pirbright are awaited in respect of suspect animals in Watergrasshill, County Cork, Dunleer, County Louth and in north County Leitrim. The situation is still high risk. In Northern Ireland and Great Britain the situation remains extremely serious.</P>
    <P>I accept that the time has come to review controls based on the best scientific advice. Today's announcements will be helpful. They are measured and of a cautious nature. From tomorrow, 2 May, stock bulls can be transported from one holding to another for breeding purposes, and movements of cattle between fragments of the same holding under a variety of circumstances and without a distance limitation will be allowed. There was a 10 kilometres limitation up to now. The movement of cattle from feed lots will be allowed from 9 May. A number of other restrictions relating to tourism and some cultural activities have also been lifted. In particular, some visitor centres have been opened to the public.</P>
    <P>For the present, I do not consider it appropriate to relax the movement of sheep. Nor do I consider it appropriate to allow farm to farm movement of animals generally. Deputy Dukes suggested that where there are not susceptible animals and no disease on a holding it poses no risk. It is impossible to say that, because the disease is of a silent nature, particularly in sheep where the symptoms are not well pronounced. In the case in Proleek in north Louth, veterinary inspectors called on a Friday to the flock and did not find any signs whatever but, on Monday, there was full-blown foot and mouth disease there. It is an extremely difficult disease to detect. That is why, after nine weeks of very considerable sacrifice by many people, recklessness in lifting controls now would be a pity. It is well worth while to keep general movement under review. I will ask the expert group to meet again early next week and, all going well between now and then, <Col N="152" /> we should be able to allow some additional relaxation of controls.</P>
    <P>The expert group meet regularly with representatives of farming organisations and go through the detail with them. Farm leaders have a good understanding of the need to be cautious in relation to movement generally.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Sheep Tagging Policy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is widely accepted that there is a need for traceability of sheep movement. Tagging is an essential part of this process. However, the undue haste of the final introduction will inevitably lead to flaws in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a national sheep identification system without research, without trial, and without the establishment of standards is a major blunder by the Minister and his officials. It is fully accepted that identification and traceability is necessary for orderly marketing of sheep in order to comply with EU regulations and respond to consumer demands. However, to introduce a scheme that is not workable or practicable is to embark on a costly failure, and the cost will inevitably have to be borne by the producer who is already under severe pressure to make a sheep farming enterprise viable.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this scheme is to provide traceability, not control, for which some officials in the Department want it used. The proposed scheme will wipe out the store lamb producers in Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon where most of the store lambs here are produced. If a farmer takes lambs to a mart for sale, it is practical to have one permanent tag and a card. A scheme whereby it will be necessary to have triplicate documentation to accompany each &ndash; one to be retained for registration, the second to be retained by the mart and the third by the buyer &ndash; will be unworkable. Before the sheep leave the mart a new tag must be put on, and these details must be recorded once more on a register. It will be necessary for the buyer to decide on a pre-determined number of tags for his purchases. In an age of technology, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is promoting a cumbersome, labour intensive and outmoded model based on documentation and a paper mountain. The problem is not one of tagging but of the type of system being introduced with it. If it flounders, as it will in its present form, we will have to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its first week, it has already led to serious confusion among the farming community. The simple obvious difficulties on the ground seem as usual to have escaped the gurus in the Department whose task it was to devise and implement a workable system. We should look at the French model where there were consultations and discussions at local and regional meetings and the legal requirements of the tags were brought in <Col N="153" /> before final implementation of the scheme. It took two years to devise an effective and efficient system. That should be our model. We require a single tag identifying the country of origin, the flock number and the individual number with one single passport card for life similar to the French model which recognises the age of technology rather than the cumbersome paper trail proposed for farmers by the Minister.</P>
    <P>What is of great concern to most farmers is that no research has been done on the system we are introducing. We have, for example, several suppliers of tags, none of which have been tried and tested. There is no consistency in design or production. Because of the lack of standardisation in design, we are bound to have losses. We are told by Mr. Frank Crosbie, chairman of the sheep production group, that we will have a 5% loss on average. What cumbersome mode of presentation will we have to replace them?</P>
    <P>It is important that this scheme is a success for all from the start. It is necessary, therefore, to introduce tagging on a pilot basis &ndash; one for an upland area and another for a lowland area &ndash; to test the products and to eliminate the teething problems which will inevitably occur. This should be promoted and supervised by the Department in consultation with the producers. I suggest, therefore, that before we get too deeply into it that the present scheme is reviewed as a matter of urgency so that it can be successful rather than allow teething troubles to cause frustration and disaster in the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for raising the matter of an individual identification system for sheep. I am pleased to have the opportunity to present to the House an outline of the proposed national sheep identification system.</P>
      <P>For a considerable time, my Department has been pursuing the introduction of a workable, effective and practical system of sheep identification which would meet the requirements of EU law, disease monitoring and which would provide traceability from a consumer assurance perspective. Such a system would also need to facilitate the implementation in full of the relevant recommendations of the Sheepmeat Forum which reported in October 1999. It is worth noting that the forum represented the consensus views of all interested parties across the sector, including farmers, processors, marts, etc., and it sat for a considerable length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only system which at this juncture offers the prospect of meeting the various objectives I have mentioned is one based on individual tagging of the national flock. A system based on fleece marks and paper is not acceptable and concerns relating to its effectiveness, cost and formal acceptance in relevant EU legislation remain to be addressed in the case of more technologically <Col N="154" /> advanced systems, such as electronic tagging or boluses.</P>
    <P>The sustained efforts by me over many months to progress the introduction of a national sheep tagging regime has been met with widespread resistance from farmers and processors alike and, from what I have heard tonight, from Deputy Burke as well. This resistance is unacceptable and I am going ahead with tagging on an individual basis because those opposed to its introduction are raising every possible objection often under the guise of supposed practical difficulties. It is worth noting that initially the Department had in mind a flock based system rather than the individual animal tagging system which forms the basis of the national sheep identification system.</P>
    <P>Given foot and mouth disease, the difficulties thrown up by that and the scandalous movement of sheep, some of it illegal &ndash; we saw what happened in Britain and the devastation caused by it there &ndash; we need a traceability system and I will ensure that we have it. The national sheep identification system will go live this month. Under the system, sheep will be tagged initially at a time of movement and details of all sheep movements will be fully recorded. Processors will be required to link the individual sheep tag number to the number of the finished carcase. We will have full traceability from the farm to the consumer. We can build on this and once and for all give Irish lamb and sheepmeat an advantage in the home and foreign markets. For the first time, Ireland will have full traceability for all sheep on an individual animal basis.</P>
    <P>Eight companies have been approved to supply tags to farmers and the Department is developing an Internet based system so that each company can place its order for tags and the system will generate a unique individual number for each animal. This will ensure among other things that farmers cannot order duplicate tags and that the Department can monitor the volume of tags being ordered. I am confident this scheme will deliver the objectives and that any teething problems can be overcome. However, we need to get the system in place. We want a practicable and workable system which is not overburdened by bureaucracy. I appreciate all of that but the time has come to make a start.</P>
    <P>We have in the order of 7.5 million to 8 million sheep in the country. We have gone through hell in the last nine weeks trying to trace sheep. Sheep bought at Carlisle mart have gone down to Devon and Cornwall, have gone all over England, Scotland and Wales, have come across to Northern Ireland, have gone down through the Republic of Ireland and have gone on to France causing problems there, and then on to the Netherlands causing difficulties there. Nobody knew from where they were coming or to where they were going because there was no traceability system. We want a system that will be workable and use<Col N="155" /> able and that will ensure that this type of movement without trace does not happen again.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will not hesitate to pursue those, whether producers, dealers, meat factories or others, who fail to meet the requirements under this system and who engage in abuses in relation to sheep identification. We will <Col N="156" /> seek to impose the sanctions provided in the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act passed unanimously by this House only a few weeks ago. I am introducing sheep tagging for disease control and to ensure proper traceability and quality control from the farm to the consumer.</P>

      <P>Any amendment or extension of the fuel rebate system is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. On 6 March 2001, he informed the House, in response to Question No. 136, that he had no immediate plans to extend the excise fuel rebate system to coach tour operators. However, recently, in the light of developments arising from the foot and mouth crisis, my Department raised the matter again with the Department of Finance on behalf of the CTTC. The current position is that the Minister for Finance has asked his Department to fully re-examine the issue and I understand that this re-examination is under way. I understand that an extension of excise rebate to the coach tour sector would have to be examined in the context of EU State Aids rules.</P>

A technical assessment in connection with this preliminary report was received from the Office of Public Works in late February 2001. Additional documentation in relation to costings and other technical elements was then requested from Ballinasloe UDC. These have since been received and examined by our technical advisors, and officials in my Department expect to be in contact with the council once the Department has completed its considerations.</P>
      <P>There are four stages in a swimming pool project &ndash; preliminary report stage, the stage at which the Ballinasloe proposal is currently, contract document stage, tender stage and construction stage. The Department's technical advisers evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project, unless prior approval issues from this Department. As a number of other stages must be completed before final approval is given to commence construction, it is not possible to be precise at this stage about a commencement date for the project.</P>

      <P>The creation of local partnerships as envisaged by Government and the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has now been incorporated by the Irish Sports Council in its Statement of Strategy, 2000-2002. This sets out the pathway which will be followed by the council in the creation of such partnerships as a means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Following an initial selection process, the first eight local partnerships have been selected by the council. These will be announced shortly and be established in May 2001, following a competitive selection process run by the Irish Sports Council. Among the criteria taken into account in the selection process were the commitment of local statutory agencies and community and voluntary groups to the partnership approach and their plans for including those from disadvantaged communities in their activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I chaired the second meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council &ndash; NSMC &ndash; in tourism sectoral format in the Institute of Technology, Letterkenny, on Friday, 30 March 2001. Also in attendance were Sir Reg Empey, MLA, Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and Dr. Sean Farren, MLA, Minister of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment, representing the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, tourism is an area for co-operation under the North-South Ministerial Council provided for in the Good Friday Agreement and, in that context, it has been agreed that a publicly owned limited company will be established to carry out functions aimed at promoting increased tourism to the island of Ireland. At our first meeting in tourism sectoral format held on 27 October 2000, myself and Minister Empey agreed the draft memorandum and articles of association for the proposed tourism company, the composition of the board and the necessary start-up arrangements. The company, known as Tourism Ireland Limited, was formally established on 11 December 2000 and the members of the board were appointed later that month.</P>
      <P>At our meeting on 30 March, the vice-chairperson of Tourism Ireland Limited, Ms Ann Riordan, accompanied by Mr. Felix Mooney, board member, gave an update on progress to date in establishing the company. Work is progressing on the further development of Tourism Brand Ireland &ndash; TBI &ndash; and marketing programmes for 2002, and staffing structures and proposals for the offices in Dublin and Coleraine are being developed. The post of chief executive has been advertised and the board hopes to be in a position to make an early appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> Minister Empey and myself conveyed to Ms Riordan our appreciation of the hard work and commitment of the chairperson, Mr. Andrew Coppel, of herself as vice-chairperson and the other members of the board in taking forward the establishment of Tourism Ireland Limited. We stressed the need to maintain this rate of progress so that Tourism Ireland Limited would be in a position to play the full part envisaged for it as quickly as possible. Illustrating this progress, we considered and approved the draft codes of conduct for board members and for the staff of the company. The codes deal with the accountability and conduct of its members and staff.</P>
    <P>At our last NSMC meeting we had asked for a discussion paper to be produced in co-operation with relevant Departments North and South, on the subject of training in the tourism and hospitality industry. At the meeting on 30 March, we discussed a paper that was jointly produced by the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment, and my own Department in conjunction with CERT.</P>
    <P>The paper provided an update on the support mechanisms and training arrangements for the tourism and hospitality sector in both parts of the island. It referred to some joint initiatives such as the International Fund for Ireland tourism programme which has facilitated North-South collaboration between the training agencies, tourism marketing boards and industry representative associations. The paper also identified some key areas where joint activities in both jurisdictions could be beneficial and it was agreed that these should be further examined.</P>
    <P>Finally, we discussed the continuing serious implications for the tourism industry, North and South, of the foot and mouth disease crisis. We reiterated the determination of the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to combat the disease in every way possible and that, for our part, we would continue to work in close consultation with our Ministerial colleagues in agriculture in that regard. We expressed our determination to work closely with Tourism Ireland Limited, Bord Fáilte Éireann, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and with the industry in ensuring that the future for tourism in both parts of the island is a positive one and that its potential is realised to the full. We sent out a strong message that the island of Ireland is open for tourism business and that, subject to the appropriate precautions, home market business &ndash; conferences, meetings, seminars and social events &ndash; should go ahead.</P>
    <P>We agreed that our next NSMC meeting would take place in Northern Ireland in June 2001.</P>

I would point out that the question of Dublin hosting some future Olympic Games is a matter for the official authorities of the city with the approval of the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 567 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, decided in November 1997, to initiate a tender procedure inviting proposals for the design, financing, construction and management of a national 50 metre swimming pool.</P>
      <P>This tender procedure, which was conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, culminated, in July last year, with the selection of a proposal submitted by the University of Limerick to develop a 50 metre swimming pool on their campus.</P>
      <P>Conditions of invitation and participation stated: &ldquo;. . . The construction period for the facility shall preferably be 15 months from the date of agreement between the promoter and a consortium. A longer period will be considered in light of submitted proposals . . .&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The university's proposal is based on receiving a capital grant of £5.95 million and an operational <Col N="163" /> subsidy of £190,000 per annum for 20 years. The swimming pool will form part of the university's multi-purpose sports building project and is located close to the National Coaching and Training Centre. I am delighted to announce that excellent progress is being made and that the university expect that the pool will be operational in late 2001.</P>

      <Quest>if, in regard to the commitment given in the Review of an Action Programme for the Millennium, he will give the total amount allocated to date to local authorities for refurbishment of existing swimming pools and construction of new pools; the number of new pools constructed; the number of pools refurbished; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving effect to the commitment outlined in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium I have secured £45 million funding for an accelerated programme of investment over the three year period 2000-02 in the refurbishment and provision of new pools under the local authority swimming pool programme. The package effectively increased the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million per year over these three years.</P>
      <P>Under the swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room and ancillary accommodation that relates directly to the swimming pool. There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives consideration to progressing each proposal to the next stage, in the context of funding available.</P>
      <P>A total of 51 proposals were submitted to my Department by local authorities under this accelerated swimming pool programme by last year's closing date of 31 July 2000. Decisions have been made in the case of five proposals and there are now 46 proposals on hand. Some 26 of these proposals relate to the construction of new or replacement pools while a further 20 relate to the refurbishment of existing pools. All of these proposals are at various stages of the approval process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While no project has been completed to date under the 2000 programme the Deputy should be aware that under the local authority swimming pool programme new pools have been built already or are under construction at Ennis, Dundalk, Navan, Gorey-Courtown, Wicklow town, Renmore and Enniscorthy. Refurbishments have <Col N="164" /> been completed or are currently being undertaken in Arklow, Monaghan, Roscommon, Waterford, Tipperary, Newcastle West and Mullingar.</P>

      <P>To address the issue in the tourism industry, CERT has designed and is delivering a series of workshops at regional locations to help tourism operators identify key issues and to develop phased action plans aimed at addressing these. By the end of March, six workshops had taken place in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Sligo and Killarney. They are being run for the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Licensed Vintners' Federation. CERT estimates that by June of this year, a total of 500 industry personnel will have attended the workshops and that there will be an increase in demand for the programme in the latter half of the year.</P>
      <P>Apart from its own preparations for the introduction of the euro, which include the commencement of staff training in April 2001 and the dual currency display in all print material for 2001, Bord Fáilte has used the opportunity of its regional roadshows to heighten awareness in the industry of the implications of the euro.</P>
      <P>Industry is also playing its part. In September 2000 the Irish Hotels Federation, in conjunction with the Restaurants Association of Ireland, recommended to all members that they should subscribe to the IBEC-EAN Ireland Code of Practice regarding the changeover. This code, which has been approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs, will provide a framework for self-regulation by the industry with regard to pricing, currency display and conversion and consumer information.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the tourism agencies under the aegis of my Department and the professional associations within the tourism industry are making careful preparations for the introduction of the euro and that they, in co-operation with other organisations such as the Euro Changeover Board, Forfás and IBEC, are doing all possible to exhort and prepare the industry for changeover. It is now up to each individual business to work to ensure it is ready in good time for the changeover.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 98, 559, 561, 587, and 589, together.</P>
      <P>As I have already outlined in an earlier reply to Deputy O'Shea, the cost of the stadium outlined in the original PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study is £230 million. That study also gave an initial guideline cost of £51 million for a campus of sporting excellence. As I explained in the House on 31 January and again on 6 March last, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, which has responsibility for overseeing the planning and development of the project, on the basis of further work carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers and professional estimates of the cost of the commercial facilities planned, now estimate the cost of the campus, excluding the stadium, at £320 million, giving a total estimated cost of £550 million. Because CSID has decided to put the project to the market on a public private partnership type of approach, they estimate that the private sector will be prepared to invest £150 million in the project, mostly for the commercial facilities. When the private donation of £50 million is taken into account, the cost to the Exchequer of Sports Campus Ireland including Stadium Ireland is estimated at £350 million.</P>

      <P>The local development work of area based partnerships and ADM community groups continues to be supported with funding under the social inclusion and child care sub-programme of the regional operational programmes. This funding amounts to £220 million over the life of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. A sum of £122 million has also been provided for the national drugs strategy under the sub-programme for this period.</P>
      <P>The local development measure required that local action plans were drawn up by partnership companies and ADM community groups, in consultation with the director of community and enterprise of the relevant city and county development boards. These plans were submitted to ADM Limited by December 2000 and were evaluated by ADM's appraisal committees for the southern and eastern region, and for the border, midlands and western region. The allocation of funding for the period 2000 to 2003 has now taken place. Allocations are subject to an annual review and the amounts allocated may be increased or decreased on the basis of each groups effectiveness in carrying out their plan.</P>
      <P>In 2000 over £16 million was drawn down under the new programme. The year 2000 also saw the completion of work under the previous local development programme &ndash; OPLURD &ndash; which amounted to funding of a further £6 million. A sum of £34.5 million has been allocated to ADM for partnerships and community groups to implement their action plans in 2001. Of this amount, £15.17 million has already been drawn down by ADM between January and April of 2001 in relation to the January-June period. This is a satisfactory level of drawdown for the period in question.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs initiative, an amount of over £9 million was drawn down under the NDP in 2000. This amount relates to expenditure under the existing local drugs task force plans. The task forces are currently in the process of submitting their new plans for assessment by the national drugs strategy team. To date, 11 plans have been submitted, of which nine have been approved, and funding of £5.6 million has been earmarked in respect of these plans to provide a wide variety of initiatives in the areas of treatment, rehabilitation and awareness, prevention and education. The remaining three plans are expected shortly. Drawdown for 2001 amounting to £60,000 is related to administrative and operational expenses only but expenditure will commence as soon as the projects provided for under the approved plans are in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The hugely increased investment in sport by the current Government has resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres. In 1999 and 2000 alone, I allocated a total of almost £56 million under the sports capital programme for the provision of facilities for the parishes, towns and cities of Ireland. I have allocated £62 million in the three programmes since this Government took office, compared with a total of only £18 million allocated in the preceding three years.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the sports capital programme are to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities; and encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications under the programme are assessed in accordance with several detailed criteria, which include the following: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport-recreational sport and-or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the financial viability of the project, that is, in addition to lottery funding, has the club-organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic time frame the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, as defined by ADM Limited's indicators, and the current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different <Col N="170" /> sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements-facilities in relation to the club's or organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their area, and with their local authority before making an application for funding and are also requested to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and-or duplication of existing facilities.</P>
    <P>Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities, my Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with all the national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. Where appropriate my Department also consults with other Departments, the local authorities and with the Irish Sports Council, in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>In addition to the sports capital programme, a sum of £85 million has been allocated for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities under the National Development Plan 2000-2006; specifically provided under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional operational programmes of the NDP. The facilities will be located at gateway towns to be identified in the national spatial strategy currently being undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Once the gateway towns have been identified, proposals will be sought from local authorities, and where appropriate voluntary and community organisations, for the provision or upgrading of sport and recreational facilities. Work on the identification of regional gateways is scheduled for completion in the summer of 2001, when implementation of the measure can begin.</P>
    <P>In 1999 my Department commissioned ILAM (Ireland), a consultancy firm specialising in sports facilities, to prepare a report on the condition of local authority swimming pools built between 1966 and 1981. Thirty pools around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment. Under the local authority swimming pool programme, I secured a £45 million funding package for the period 2000-02, an increase in the annual budget from £3 million to £15 million per annum over these years. Grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.</P>
    <P>Applicants seeking funding for major sports and recreation facilities under my Department's <Col N="171" /> sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes are required to provide a feasibility study setting out detailed assessments on such areas as the types of facilities planned, their potential utilisation, viability, appropriateness to local, regional and national requirements and policy directions and their sustainability over a long period of time. As part of the Government's overall sports policy, my Department has also committed a grant of £5.95 million towards the construction of the national 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick. Construction of this pool is under way and is expected to be completed later this year. With regard to national sports facilities and their role in my Department's integrated sports policy, Sports Campus Ireland will, of course, cater for a large number of sports, providing a range of top-class facilities for their training and competitive needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 88 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a framework for the implementation of strand I of the RAPID programme, catering for urban centres with the greatest concentration of disadvantage, is well advanced. Initial work has been undertaken in each of the 25 areas designated under the programme, to put the delivery structures in place. Over the past weeks, advertisements have been placed seeking applicants for the post of national co-ordinator and for local co-ordinators who are being recruited by relevant local authorities. Once the co-ordinators are in place, area implementation teams will be formally established to commence work on the preparation and delivery of area action plans.</P>
      <P>It is intended that area plans will identify the specific needs of each of the designated areas, and taking into account any existing proposals for the area, will provide a blue-print for the development of these areas, by directing funds under the national development plan to alleviate the highlighted disadvantage. The area plans will also address the co-ordination of activity and the co-operation of effort between public services provided in the designated areas. Beyond these general guidelines it is intended that there should be an appropriate degree of flexibility in the preparation of development plans to cater for the various needs of different areas. The national co-ordinator will provide on-going guidance to local co-ordinators in the design of the area plans and the delivery of the programme.</P>
      <P>The design of strand II of the programme, catering for rural areas and provincial towns is also under way. The identification and selection of disadvantaged areas in the provincial towns will proceed along lines similar to the process used for strand I and is currently being progressed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The selection of disadvantaged rural areas is also proceeding led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

      <P>In 1999, the Government launched the international sports tourism initiative. A fund of £2.5 million, annually, over a three year period, 2000-03, was made available to support efforts to attract major sporting events to Ireland with identified tourism benefits in terms of attracting incremental visitors and international publicity. <Col N="173" /> The objective for the initiative is to accelerate the building of Ireland's international reputation as a sports venue and consequently to increase sports-related tourism. Subsequently, in the budget for 2001, the duration of the fund was extended to the year 2005 and the allocation increased by a further £2.5 million annually.</P>
      <P>An International Sports Tourism Partnership Advisory Group, under the chairmanship of the chief executive of Bord Fáilte, has been established to evaluate applications for assistance under the fund in line with specified criteria and to make recommendations for final decisions by the board of Bord Fáilte As the Deputy will be aware we have already secured the Special Olympics Summer Games in 2003 and the Ryder Cup in 2005. A number of major golf tournaments will be sponsored this year, including the International Pairs, the Smurfit European Open and the Murphy's Irish Open. For next year the prestigious American Express World Golf Championship and the Seve Trophy will be held in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, events which will be held in Ireland this year and in 2002 include the Laser and Laser Yachting Masters, the Masters World Surfing Championship, the European Figure Skating Open series, the World Cross Country Championships and the ITU Triathlon World Cup Series. I am confident that the International Sports Tourism initiative will help raise Ireland's profile as a major sports venue and generate significant tourism benefits in the years to come.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme for 2001 was advertised in mid-December 2000 with a closing date of 9 February, 2001 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,450 applications were received and these are currently being assessed strictly in accordance with the programme's assessment criteria, which are published in document entitled Guidelines, Terms and Conditions for the Programme. Under the assessment process, every applications is strictly treated on its own merits. Each application is scored between zero and five for each of the programme's criteria, depending on the extent to which they meet them and different 'weights', from one to four, are attached to the criteria, depending on their importance. Each application receives a score which decides its order of priority within its own county. Recom<Col N="174" /> mendations, based on conclusions from this process and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution, the population of the county and the quality of the applications from the county, are then made.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds to benefit all types of eligible projects in all categories, having regard to the existing range of facilities in each county while also affording the highest priority to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people. The sports capital programme provides funding for sporting facilities at national, regional and local level. The national grants are allocated in respect of the facilities of the national governing bodies of sport; in recent years such grant allocations include, for example, the National Boxing Stadium, a new National Rowing Centre at Iniscarra, County Cork and a new indoor stadium for athletics at Morton Stadium.</P>
      <P>Regional grants are allocated in respect of developments throughout the country such as at GAA county grounds, Eircom League grounds, All-Ireland Rugby League grounds and new regional athletics tracks. Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities, my Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with the relevant national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities.</P>
      <P>Where appropriate, my Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council, other Government Departments and with the local authorities in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities. In any particular year, the allocation of grants to national and regional facilities, arising particularly from the prioritisation established by the relevant governing bodies of the sports involved, can lead to some apparent distortion of county totals. However, I would expect that in the course of time, the distribution of such grants would be reasonably equitable.</P>
      <P>Under the 2000 sports capital programme, for the first time, I introduced a new clause by making a minimum of £200,000 available for allocation to each county, subject of course to the requirement that applications for funding from suitable projects, which meet my Department's criteria, have been submitted from each county. I will again be invoking this clause for the 2001 programme as I believe that it has already, and will in the future, ensure a more equitable spread of funding between counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that all counties have benefited tremendously from the increased funding I have secured for the sports capital programme and all have received more funding from 1998 to 2000 than in preceding years. In 1999 and 2000 alone, I allocated a total of almost £56 million under the sports capital programme for the provision of facilities for the parishes, towns and cities of Ireland. I have allocated £62 million in the <Col N="175" /> three programmes since this Government took office, compared with a total of only £18 million allocated in the preceding three years. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the 2001 sports capital programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      <P>In relation to the proposed National Conference Centre at Spencer Dock, Bord Fáilte has confirmed that, as no major construction work had taken place on the site by January 2001, the grant contract with the developers formally terminated in March 2001. Given that the original research that influenced the concept of such a centre is almost ten years old, Bord Fáilte has now commissioned new research, to be completed in the next two months, on the international conference market and the optimum positioning of Ireland within that market. I await the outcome of this research before bringing recommendations to Government on how best to take forward the objective of a National Conference Centre.</P>

      <P>The EU Urban II Community Initiative Programme for Ireland was submitted to the EU Commission in November 2000 and on 11 April this year the Commission confirmed that the draft programme was admissible with regard to the relevant EU regulation. The Commission will now proceed with the appraisal process involving detailed discussions with the managing authority for the programme (Urban Ballyfermot Ltd.) with a view to having it approved by mid summer. The programme will provide funding of £8.5 million, of which 50% will be Exchequer funded, for the physical and social regeneration of Ballyfermot, Dublin.</P>

      <P>I established a group to undertake a comprehensive review of the operation of the national lottery funded sports capital programme in July 1998. Based on the report and recommendations of this group, I introduced a revamped sports capital programme, incorporating revised guidelines, assessment criteria, terms and conditions, which has been operating since 1999. While I have no plans to carry out another comprehensive review at this stage, I can assure the Deputy that the operation of the programme is monitored on an ongoing basis and amended as required to ensure continued efficiency and effectiveness of the programme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the new programme has been of enormous help to clubs and community organisations throughout the country, including those in disadvantaged areas to whom special priority is given, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 569 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give a cost to the State of the proposed swimming pool projects in Cobh and Youghal, County Cork as grant-aid is not allocated to any project until such time as tenders are received. In general, there are four stages in a swimming pool project &ndash; preliminary report stage, contract document stage, tender stage and construction stage. The Department's technical advisors evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project, unless prior approval issues from this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position with the replacement pool proposal in Cobh is that Cobh UDC were advised to seek tenders for the work involved and to submit a copy of the recommended tender to the Department for approval in due course. In relation to the pool proposal for Youghal, <Col N="177" /> additional documentation recently received from the council in relation to the preliminary report will be forwarded to our technical advisers for assessment. The council will be informed when this assessment is complete. Under the swimming pool programme administered by my Department, grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project.</P>

      <P>The overall objective of the review was to identify any gaps or deficiencies in existing strategy, to develop new strategies, and if necessary, new arrangements through which to deliver them. The review group have completed their work and its final report was recently presented to Government. It will be launched to the public on 10 May 2001 and will set out a policy framework through which those involved in addressing the drug problem can work for the next number of years.</P>

      <P>As I have previously indicated to the Deputy, the views obtained by my Department from the Office of the Attorney General and from other relevant Departments, raise <Col N="178" /> serious and fundamental questions on the viability and constitutionality of the Prohibition of Ticket Touts Bill 1998. The views expressed by these Departments have indicated that the Bill raises a number of important issues, including possible constitutional implications such as the rights to private property, the freedom to contract, as well as a number of crucial issues relating to enforcement, policing and Garda powers, all of which require careful consideration before it would be appropriate to proceed with consideration of the Bill at Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the Deputy's genuine concerns in relation to ticket touting, I am sure he will also appreciate that as this Bill was initiated as a Private Members' Bill, Departments did not have an opportunity to input into its preparation or to carry out any prior assessment of its feasibility and its implications for other services. Accordingly, I am now arranging for the observations received by my Department to be brought to the attention of the Select Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation to seek that committee's views on how best to proceed in the light of the advice received on the viability and appropriateness of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Three members of staff have been seconded from the Department of the Taoiseach to work on the Stadium Ireland project at Abbotstown. The grades of the staff concerned are one principal officer, one higher executive officer and one executive officer.</P>
      <P>Note: Two staff from the Department of the Taoiseach, Ms Kitty Maloney and Ms Mary Keane are seconded directly to Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited and one, Mr. Donagh Morgan is seconded to Magahy and Co.</P>
      <P>Reasons for secondments: Ms Maloney and Ms Keane provide clerical and secretarial support to the executive chairperson. As all executive services for Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited are contracted to Magahy and Co., it was necessary to second Mr. Morgan to them in order that his prior experience, through the feasibility study etc., would continue to be available to the secretariat of Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Duration of secondments: all were informed in their letters of appointment that the period of secondment is for a maximum of five years in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines. However, these are guidelines only and can be exceeded with Department of Finance sanction. Generally applications for sanction to extend secondments are looked upon favourably and in a small number of other secondments from <Col N="179" /> this Department to other bodies the five year guideline has been exceeded. In each case pay costs are recouped to the Department of the Taoiseach by the outside body concerned.</P>
    <P>Other staff working for Campus and Stadium Ireland: Two former Department of the Taoiseach employees now work for Campus and Stadium Ireland. These are Mr. Paddy Teahon, formerly Secretary General of the Department and now executive chairperson of Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited. Mr. Teahon receives remuneration equivalent to half his secretary general salary before retirement. This is split 30%-70% between Digital Media Development Limited and Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited. Ms Evelyn Eager resigned as personal assistant in the Department of the Taoiseach in November 2000 and was offered a contract with Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited.</P>
    <P>Previous staffing PQ: The Department of the Taoiseach answered a parliamentary question on <Col N="180" /> 14 February 2001 relating to all secondments from the Department. The three secondments above were given and the only comment on the stadium was from Deputy Owen when she said: &ldquo;What is the purpose of sending so many staff to these different Agencies? It is interesting that three have gone to Campus Ireland. I thought only one had gone. There are now three there to keep an eye on things for the Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would refer to the full statement I made to the Dáil on Thursday 29 March in regard to the outcome of the European Council which I attended at Stockholm on 23 and 24 March 2001. The core business of the Stockholm European Council was ensuring further progress on the economic and social agenda of the European Union, building on the strategy we set out at Lisbon last year, namely to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world by 2010.</P>
      <P>I understand that the relevant Ministers are addressing those areas of direct concern to their Departments in the replies to the separate questions on this subject which have been put to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards areas where my Department has an operational role, the Lisbon conclusions include the broad area of regulatory reform which cuts <Col N="182" /> across the functional responsibilities of many Departments. Particular reference is made to removing unnecessary red tape, paying attention to the impact and compliance costs of proposed regulations and engaging in dialogue with business and citizens. My Department's role in regard to regulatory reform is one of co-ordination and support.</P>
    <P>My Department is also directly involved in the development of the Information Society eEurope Action Plan. The Department is co-ordinating and facilitating the delivery of electronic public services to feed into the new Government action plan on the information Society. In this context, we are promoting the benchmarking on an EU level of the provision by electronic means of a comprehensive range of public services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 113, 114, 117 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>I am happy to confirm that the grant payable to managing agents on the Job Initiative Programme will increase from £220 to £238 per participant, per week, and will be backdated to 1 April 2001. Managing agents may retain up to 12% of the FÁS grant towards training and development of the participants, administration costs and overheads of the project. The grant increase will, therefore, provide for a new minimum payment to job initiative participants of £209.43, representing an increase of £15.83 per week on the previous minimum payment.</P>
      <P>The work experience and training provided for participants on job initiative as an active labour market programme is not a substitute for mainstream employment. Accordingly, it is considered more appropriate to link the rate increase in job initiative to the hourly increase granted in the case of community employment participants, in line with recent general social welfare rate increases.</P>

      <P>The rationale of the work permit system, as in other countries, is to allow employers to fill a post, on a temporary basis, with a non-national where it cannot be filled either by an Irish or other EEA national. <Col N="186" /> The circumstances in respect of a particular sector or post may well change within a year and it is for this reason that permits are issued only for one year at a time. If circumstances are still the same after 12 months then a renewed work permit may be sought and granted.</P>
      <P>If an employee remains with the same employer for five years a permit without limit may issue to that employer. The employer would not then need to apply for a further work permit unless the employee's passport number is changed. In the case of the individual concerned, he is currently on his fourth work permit. This will expire later this year. While processing time for renewals is kept as short as possible, it is reasonable to expect applicants to engage in some forward planning in this area.</P>

      <Quest> if, in respect of commitments made at the Lisbon Summit 2000 concerning economic reform in order to make the European Union the most competitive economic area by 2010, she will list the number of measures that have to be undertaken by her Department; the stage at which these measures are; the title and brief description of each measure; when it is expected to have the measure taken or implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Lisbon Summit 2000, the heads of state or Government set a vision for the EU to become by 2010, the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. The Lisbon agenda is a very broadly based strategy aimed at meeting this objective while ensuring coherence, co-ordination and integration of policy and initiatives across the three very broadly defined domains of economic, employment and social policy and thereby promoting their mutually reinforcing impact.</P>
      <P>Ireland is fully committed to playing its full part in meeting the Lisbon objectives both through its participation and contribution in initiatives being developed at the EU institutional level and through national economic and social policy development. Since effectively all of the policies and actions being implemented in my Department contribute in one way or another to the Lisbon agenda, it would be impracticable to set out in this reply all of the measures, and progress on them, sought by the Deputy. The annual report of my Department for 2000 is now available on my Department's website, http://www.entemp.ie, and should provide an indication of progress under the various policy areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, given the broad strategic nature of the Lisbon agenda, progress is best measured <Col N="187" /> on a broad basis rather than by specific measures. In that regard, the most recent report of progress was made in the synthesis report, Realising the European Union's Potential: Consolidating and Extending the Lisbon Strategy, which was submitted by the Commission to the European Council in Stockholm in March last. This report includes annexes which set out policy progress as well as a set of country specific indicators used to measure member state performance in key policy areas covered by the Lisbon agenda. The report and annexes can be accessed on website, http://www.europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/com/cnc/2001/ com2001-0079en02.html. If the Deputy requires more specific information on particular areas of policy, I will of course be happy to endeavour to supply same.</P>

      <P>The attraction of industry to a particular location is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are structured on a regional basis so as to ensure that the above objective will be achieved. Over the last 18 months IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies with the objective of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into Objective One regions in the coming years. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions. In 2000 IDA Ireland achieved this target.</P>
      <P>With regard to Ballinasloe, I established the Ballinasloe inter agency group in February 2000 in response to the announcement by AT Cross of job losses at the company. In my announcement establishing that group, I asked the IDA to treat Ballinasloe as a prime location for overseas investment. I also requested the chairman of the group to liaise with the public and private sectors and the community bodies which can assist in promoting the area for investment and job creation. I am informed that work is now under way for the production of a new industrial brochure for the town under the aegis of the group. Work is also being undertaken on the development of a skills profile and training requirements for the AT Cross workforce by FÁS and SIPTU.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above activity, IDA Ireland acquired 35 acres of land at Creagh on the east side of Ballinasloe in 1999 for the development of a new high specification business park. Phase one of the development work and all services on the site have now been completed. The IDA has worked with a local group of developers who have completed construction of a new 27,800 sq ft advance unit on the new park. The IDA will be aggressively marketing this building and the business park to overseas clients.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's efforts to secure inward investment for Ballinasloe have resulted in Valois, a French engineering company, establishing a manufacturing operation in the town. The company is commencing operations in a temporary facility while it is working with its property advisers to design and develop a new customised facility. The company will employ 60 people at full production and recruitment is actively under way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 122 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The number of employment agencies currently holding an employment agency licence under the Employment Agency Act, 1971, is 686. No employment agency licences have been revoked in the past five years. My Department does not keep statistics of employment agency licences which have not been renewed. In cases where a licence has not been renewed the simple reason for such non-renewal is that the employment agency has not applied for a new licence. It is a requirement of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, that applicants for an employment agency licence must apply each year to renew the licence and also place an advertisement in a national daily newspaper to this effect. It is accordingly assumed by my Department that such agencies are no longer trading as an employment agency.</P>
      <P>My Department is undertaking a review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971. As part of this review, it is intended to introduce a new computer-based system in relation to the issuing of employment agency licences. This new system will facilitate the production of more elaborate statistics concerning, among others, the renewal and non-renewal of employment agency licences. It will also include a facility which will automatically send renewal application forms to every licensed agency eight weeks prior to the renewal date of the licence. This will put the onus on the agency to indicate its intentions to my Department. I expect to have this new system in place over the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorised number of labour inspectors in my Department is 17. By way of Government <Col N="190" /> decision in December 1999, and in the context of the introduction of the national minimum wage in April 2000, seven extra inspectors were allocated to the labour inspectorate bringing the authorised number of Inspectors to 17. There are 14 of these inspectors in place currently. There are three vacancies due to career breaks and promotions.</P>
      <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for the enforcement of all employment rights legislation. Such legislation covers a wide range of areas including: payment of wages, organisation of working time, covering areas such as holiday entitlements, rest periods, maximum working time and night work, safeguarding of employees rights on the transfer of undertakings, protection of young persons at work, minimum wage entitlements, provisions contained in employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements arising from industrial relations legislation.</P>
      <P>All persons employed under a contract of employment within the State are entitled to the full protection of Irish employment rights legislation. Breaches of provisions contained in the legislation may come to the attention of my Department either by way of complaint by an individual employee or other concerned person or by routine inspections carried out by my Department's labour inspectorate. Allegations of breaches of employment legislation, such as excessive working hours and non-payment of national minimum wage or holiday pay, are thoroughly investigated by the labour inspectors of my Department. Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the legislation and irregularities are not resolved through the co-operation of the employer in question, the matter is referred to my legal advisers for consideration as to the institution of legal proceedings against the employer concerned.</P>
      <P>Labour inspectors have powers to enter places of work, question employers and employees and examine records. Inspectors carry out night work as part of their normal conditions of service and that element of their duties is almost exclusively related to protection of young persons enforcement work. My Department's labour inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.</P>

      <P>I am aware that reports are received from time to time regarding excessive predation on fish stocks by cormorants. However, the extent of the damage to these stocks has not been quantified with precision. In the case of salmon stocks it is thought that cormorants may prey significantly on migrating salmon smolts. In this regard I have asked the National Salmon Commission for analysis and advice in relation to predation in general on the salmon species.</P>
      <P>Cormorants are, of course, a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, which provides that they may not be hunted save under licence issued by the Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands. Such a licence may be issued where the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is satisfied that damage is being done to a fishery by cormorants. I am informed by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands that 11 such licences were issued during 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 to 133 inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yes, I am aware that technology exists to exploit gas at greater water depths and possibly more unfavourable environments than that which pertains in the Corrib field. The company to which the Deputy refers is a partner in the Corrib <Col N="194" /> development. The technology proposed for the Corrib development could also be deployed at greater depths and harsher sea conditions than those found in the Corrib.</P>
    <P>Technology is available to process gas offshore on a gas field such as the Corrib. However this would not eliminate the need for an onshore terminal and such a terminal would have all the essential features of a terminal in circumstances where there is no offshore processing. These features would include a flare stack, provision for storage of liquids, provision for installation for compressors and facilities for discharging produced fluids. The cost effective and optimum development system for the Corrib is a subsea development with processing at a terminal onshore. If processing were to take place in field, it would require the deployment of floating facilities which would mean that production would be weather sensitive &ndash; a serious drawback in the hostile environment of the Corrib. Increased capital and operational expenditures would be needed which could make the development uneconomic and there would be serious safety implications as the offshore facilities would have to be manned.</P>
    <P>An environmental impact statement is required to be submitted for my approval before the lessees can engage in any development work leading to or associated with the extraction of oil or gas. Among the issues that fall to be addressed under the environmental impact statement are the effects of the proposed development on human beings. In deciding whether the proposed working of petroleum would or would not be likely to have significant effects on the environment one of the criteria which I will be taking into account includes the environmental sensitivity of the geographical area likely to be affected having regard in particular to existing land use. The purpose of the environmental impact statement is to identify potential harmful effects on the environment, if any, and to put forward proposed measures to mitigate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall responsibility for marine pollution prevention, preparedness, response and management is assigned to the Irish Coast Guard. This includes responsibility for dealing with all aspects of oil pollution of the sea and coastal areas, and in particular, supervising the planning and implementation by local and harbour authorities of arrangements for the protection of coastal amenity-fishery-wildlife areas; the removal of <Col N="195" /> oil from the coastline, and in the event of a major pollution incident, the direction and co-ordination of the onshore response.</P>
      <P>The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1999, provides the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources with the legislative power to require harbours and ports, oil handling facilities and maritime local authorities to submit contingency plans, based on realistic risk assessment, for approval by the coastguard. Templates for these plans have been provided to the harbour and port authorities which require risk assessment and a comprehensive breakdown of their risk management facilities &ndash; command and control, communications, manpower, equipment, training, and exercises. These contingency plans are part of the overall national plan, also required by the above Act, which is being prepared by the coastguard.</P>
      <P>The coastguard has provided national pollution management courses for approximately 40 harbour-port and local authority personnel per year for the past number of years. These courses are based on the International Maritime Organisation standards. Due to the demand it is intended to increase these courses from two to three per year catering for 60 participants. The coastguard also sends harbour-port and local authority personnel on European courses provided by the EU.</P>
      <P>The coastguard has national stockpiles of equipment at Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dublin. This equipment is used in the pollution courses and as far as possible complements the equipment held at the harbours and ports. This equipment is valued at over £2 million and is being added to each year. The equipment is divided into 30% offshore response and 70% on-shore response.</P>
      <P>No country has sufficient State equipment to respond to every pollution emergency. However, there are commercial companies which will provide equipment on request and guarantee it will be on-site within 12 to 24 hours. The coastguard has my authority to contract equipment as required. Ireland has been invited to accede to the Bonn Agreement. This agreement is between north European countries and provides for mutual support in marine pollution incidents. Ireland is also a member of the EU pollution management committee which can provide experts and support drawn from other EU countries in support of a member state response.</P>
      <P>The coastguard can call on its marine pollution response team in major emergencies. This team is made up of Coast Guard and Marine Surveyors Office personnel from my Department and local and harbour-port authority personnel. This team has managed emergencies very competently in the past.</P>
      <P>I have Government approval to further study the provision of emergency towing vessels, ETV, on the south west approaches and the Irish Sea for intervention and pollution prevent in marine emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> I am awaiting a report from the marine emergency advisory group on aerial surveillance remote sensing. This facility would provide a detection and deterrent of pollution and the means to prosecute illegal discharge in the Irish pollution responsibility zone.</P>
    <P>Marine pollution response in Ireland is continuously developing and co-operation between harbour-port and local authorities and the oil companies is strongly encouraged and facilitated by the coastguard.</P>

      <P>The legislation governing petroleum developments is the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960. The provisions of this Act relating to the environmental impact assessment require the applicant seeking approval for the working of petroleum to submit an environmental impact statement to me for consideration. The legislation therefore places the onus on the developer rather than the competent authority to prepare and submit the environmental impact statement.</P>
      <P>In deciding whether the proposed working of petroleum would or would not be likely to have significant effects on the environment I am obliged, before reaching a decision on the proposed development, to have regard to criteria which are specified in the legislation. These criteria include possible long-term risks, if any, to health and the environment. Before reaching a decision on a project of this nature my Department will carry out an extensive consultative process with both internal and external experts, statutory consultees and the general public on the environmental impact statement.</P>
      <P>My Department has also engaged Environmental Resource Management, ERM, to advise on the environmental impact statement submission by Enterprise Energy Ireland. This advice is for the purpose of determining if the EIS conforms with statutory requirements, to advise on its adequacy and to ascertain the likelihood of significant impacts arising from the proposed activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environmental statement will be available for inspection by the public as soon as the plan of development is formally submitted to me and a notice published by Enterprise Energy Ireland to this effect. The public is entitled to make submissions or observations to me in relation to the effects on the environment of the proposed development. The environmental impact statement and the observations-submissions thereon <Col N="197" /> will then be rigorously examined by my Department in consultation with the relevant State agencies and the prescribed bodies, An Taisce, Dúchas and Mayo County Council. When this process has been completed I will be in a position to make a decision on the proposed development.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this issue dates back to 1992 and involved Waterford Harbour Commissioners as the predecessor body to the Port of Waterford Company. I have sought a report from the port company in the matter and I am advised as follows.</P>
      <P>With regard to the £3,000 compensation payment made to each of 26 Cheekpoint fishermen back in 1992, compensation was deemed appropriate for those who were drift net fishing in the vicinity of Cheekpoint and might therefore be affected by the installation of the groynes in their drift zone. With this in mind, the drift net licensing authority, the Southern Regional Fisheries Board supplied licence records from 1982 to 1992, with Cheekpoint fishermen highlighted. A provisional list was drawn up from these records, which was duly amended by representatives of the drift net fishermen who were conducting the compensation negotiations to provide the final list used for the payments. The three individuals to whom the Deputy has specifically referred were not identified by the representatives of the drift net fishermen as qualifying for the compensation payments made in 1992.</P>
      <P>A substantial lump sum fund has been offered to some 46 High Court plaintiffs from the Cheekpoint area through the offices of their senior counsel. This fund is in settlement of their claims against the Port of Waterford Company regarding the installation of the River Groynes. The settlement offer has been made on the basis that the plaintiff's legal representatives preside over the distribution of the fund. The port company has no influence over what amounts are being offered to each of the plaintiffs.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to ascertain from the information supplied whether the three individuals specifically referred to will receive moneys from the current High Court settlement. Two of the three names appear on the list of plaintiffs in the court case, but they may not necessarily be the same individuals.</P>

      <P>The pier in question is owned by Donegal County Council and its repair and maintenance is the responsibility of the local authority in the first instance. In 1999 and 2000 my Department provided funding of £133,827 for Donegal County Council for the provision of a slipway at the location in question. The county council also completed a site investigation last year into possible pier and breakwater developments, towards which my Department contributed £52,500. A proposal from the Donegal County Council for further pier improvements is under consideration in the context of the fishery harbours development programme for 2001, in the light of the funding available for such works and overall national priorities.</P>

      <P>I refer to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 88 on 10 April 2000 in which I stated that while I have met a number of individuals and groups to hear their views on the merits or demerits of a buy-out of driftnet salmon licences, I have not received to date any substantiated and fully quantified proposals which address the complexities of the Irish situation in the round. Recently, I have had discussions with the North Atlantic Salmon Fund regarding the international experience in the area of voluntary schemes to reduce commercial fishing for salmon.</P>
      <P>As I have previously informed the House, I have asked the National Salmon Commission to analyse and advise me on a range of priority issues, including incentivising reduction of commercial fishing effort. The commission is working to form consensus advice which will inform my consideration. The issues are complex and I have cautioned against simplistic solutions in the Irish context, particularly regarding any funding mechanisms which might apply in the case of Exchequer or private sector funding.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there have been allegations in recent months of encroachment onto sites which have been licensed by my Department for the extensive cultivation of mussels in Carlingford Lough. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing and it is too early, at this stage, to speculate as to what the findings of those investigations may reveal.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, extensive cultivation or bottom culture of mussels involves the placement of mussel seed on suitable specified areas of the sea bed where, in due course, the seed matures to mussels of marketable size which are then harvested and sold. Licence holders are entitled to the benefits of the shellfish which they have cultivated and where there is evidence of illicit harvesting of shellfish, the Department will take appropriate action.</P>
      <P>The innocent passage of vessels through a licensed bottom culture site is not prohibited. Equally it should be understood that most of Carlingford Lough remains as a public fishery and may be fished by any vessel which is properly licensed and registered as a fishing boat.</P>

If and when this happens, Ireland would examine closely any such proposals. This will be done with regard to Ireland's nuclear policy, with regard to Ireland's responsibilities under the EU treaties, including those relating to EURATOM, and with regard to Ireland's interest in assisting the states of central and eastern Europe in improving safety standards in nuclear power facilities.</P>

      <P>Rosemary Nelson was brutally murdered in a car-bomb attack in Lurgan on 15 March 1999. This murder was an attack on a dedicated and committed defence lawyer and human rights defender. It also represented a fundamental assault on the legal system itself. On 29 March 1999, the Deputy Chief Constable of Norfolk, Colin Port, was appointed to lead the investigation into her murder, an investigation which is still ongoing. Colin Port has made several public appeals for information and made arrangements to be contactable directly. In March 2000, the Port investigation team arrested a former soldier of the Royal Irish Regiment who was subsequently convicted of a charge, unrelated to Rosemary Nelson's murder, of storing weapons and sentenced to nine years in prison.</P>
      <P>The Government acknowledges the great effort which the Port investigative team has made and hopes it will succeed in bringing the perpetrators to justice. However, the Government recognises that Rosemary Nelson's case raises wider issues of concern to her family, to the public and to the international community. This is reflected in the great number of calls, both nationally and internationally, for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her death. The Taoiseach met members of Rosemary Nelson's family on 20 February 2001, and after the meeting, called for the establishment of a public inquiry into the murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his report to the 57th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, held this month, the special rapporteur on the independence of <Col N="204" /> judges and lawyers, Param Cumaraswamy, for the first time called for a &ldquo;judicial commission of inquiry&rdquo; into the murder of Rosemary Nelson. The Government welcomed his call for a commission of inquiry and reiterated the Government's call for a public inquiry into the murder.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department remain in close contact with the British authorities in relation to the investigation. They also maintain close contact with human rights organisations, both at home and abroad, with members of Rosemary Nelson's family and with other interested parties. The Government shares with all of these organisations the fervent hope that the perpetrators of Rosemary Nelson's murder will be brought to justice as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Robert Hamill died on 8 May 1997, following an attack in Portadown. RUC officers were in the vicinity at the time. In 1997, six people were charged in connection with his murder, five of whom were released. One person was convicted of causing an affray but not murder. Following an RUC investigation into the actions of RUC officers on the night in question, which was supervised by the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, the DPP decided not to proceed with the prosecution of any of the RUC officers involved.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach met with members of the Hamill family on 8 June 2000 and afterwards stated that the case was of urgent public interest and that the issues of concern involved must be resolved in a manner which would command the confidence of the community through an independent, judicial public inquiry. On 24 November 2000, the Police Ombudsman took over &ldquo;direct and active&rdquo; supervision of the police disciplinary investigation. She said that she would &ldquo;dedicate all the necessary resources to ensure that all avenues are investigated, exposed and exploited&rdquo; in this &ldquo;very sensitive&rdquo; case.</P>
      <P>The Hamill family met with the then Secretary of State on 2 October 2000 and with Prime Minister Blair in Belfast on 18 January 2001, where they discussed developments in the case. After meeting the Prime Minister, the family said that they felt a public inquiry would eventually be established.</P>
      <P>On 10 April 2001, the Ombudsman announced that seven people had been arrested in connection with her investigation. They were released without charge on police bail the next day. Her investigation is ongoing. The family issued a statement, welcoming the arrests but repeating their call for a public inquiry.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to monitor closely developments in Mr. Hamill's case and to pursue its concerns actively with the British authorities.</P>

    <P>It is our understanding that the vast majority of those detained have been convicted of a crime. My Department offers appropriate consular assistance to all Irish citizens whether convicted or detained awaiting trial. Ireland does not have a practice of entering into bilateral human rights agreements with other countries. Rather we avail of existing international human rights instruments such as the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to which Ireland and 47 other states are party. The convention provides procedures for the transfer of prisoners to serve their sentence in their home country. In addition, the majority of countries in which Irish citizens are detained are party to a number of key international human rights instruments which require states to comply with certain minimum human rights standards. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 10(1) of which states, &ldquo;All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.&rdquo;</P>

While there were no specific measures undertaken by this Department as a result of the Lisbon Summit, this Department was involved in the overall strategic negotiations leading to the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit. The European Council and European Commission undertook a number of measures as a result of the Lisbon conclusions, which Ireland fully supports.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies I gave previously on 20 and 22 March and of 11 April to related questions from Deputies Spring, Durkan, Gregory, O'Sullivan and Lawlor concerning the situation in Algeria and, in particular, developments at the UN Human Rights Commission, including the question of the appointment of a special rapporteur. In those replies I referred to the insufficient support within the Commission for the adoption of a resolution and the opposition of Algeria to the appointment of a special rapporteur. I pointed out that it would be counterproductive were a resolution to be proposed only to be heavily defeated in divisive circumstances. Such a defeat would only be of benefit to the hardliners and would send an entirely wrong signal as to the progress which we wish to see in Algeria.</P>
      <P>The EU Presidency delivered a strong statement at the Commission on Human Rights under agenda item 9, which concerns the question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in which we outlined our concern at human rights abuses in Algeria. The EU urged the Government of Algeria to take concrete measures to combat extrajudicial executions, disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention and to bring those responsible to justice. The EU reaffirmed its commitment to a comprehensive dialogue with the Algerian authorities and encouraged the government of Algeria to further its dialogue with human rights NGOs. The EU urged Algeria to respond positively to the requests for visits by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions. The EU stated that it will follow closely the activity of the newly created National Commission in Algeria for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>These issues were also raised directly with President Bouteflika and Foreign Minister Belkhadem in the course of the recent Ministerial visit by the EU Troika to Algiers on 24 April.</P>

      <P>The report of the United Nations panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo &ndash; DRC &ndash; makes a number of extremely serious allegations against countries involved in the war in the DRC. Rwanda and Uganda are singled out for particular criticism in relation to the mass-scale looting and illegal exploitation of resources such as gold, diamonds, coltan and timber that has taken place in the DRC since the outbreak of war in 1998.</P>
      <P>Uganda and Rwanda have strongly rejected these allegations and in particular the assertion that their involvement in the DRC is on grounds other than genuine security concerns. Both countries have pledged to continue to co-operate with the Security Council's efforts to restore peace to the DRC and have reaffirmed their support for the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. They have also stated their willingness to make available to the UN any of their nationals named in the report for investigation.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Security Council has scheduled a meeting for 3 May to allow the Governments named in the report to respond to the accusations against them. As a member of the Security Council and as a major development partner of Uganda, Ireland will be listening very carefully to the statements of all the parties, in particular Uganda but also Rwanda. The Government has already expressed its concern about the allegations to the Government of Uganda at a senior level.</P>
      <P>The Government is examining the report and will make its position known at the meeting of the Security Council on 3 May. The report contains disturbing evidence, although the nature and extent of this evidence varies greatly. Where allegations have been made, we expect these to be fully investigated by the relevant authorities in the countries concerned. Although no investigation has taken place into whether development assistance received by Uganda and Rwanda is helping their war efforts, the Government is satisfied that all Irish aid to these countries has been used for its intended purpose.</P>
      <P>When considering the panel of experts report, Ireland will be mindful of the wider peace process in the DRC and of the importance of using this report as a means of strengthening the peace process rather than undermining it. We will bear in mind the positive steps towards peace which have been taken in recent months, with all parties to the conflict now engaged in a process of disengagement from front lines which is being observed by United Nations monitors. The next crucial step will be for the parties to agree a timetable for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the DRC.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to regular massacres and murders of innocent civilians in Colombia perpetrated in particular by paramilitary forces which were established or assented to by the State as well as by guerrilla and other groups; and the steps which are being taken directly or through the European Union to encourage an ending of such activity.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with our EU partners and the wider international community, the Government deplores the continuing violence of both paramilitary groups and guerillas. In our contacts with the Colombian authorities, we have regularly raised incidents involving attacks on and murder of innocent civilians, and have urged them to do all in their power to protect the vulnerable and to bring the perpetrators of violent acts to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union has put in place a Programme of Support for the Peace Process in Colombia to which Ireland is a contributor. This programme focuses on support for the rule of law; the defence of human rights and of international humanitarian law; the fight against the causes of violence, and assistance for the victims of viol<Col N="210" /> ence; the protection of biodiversity and the environment; and the enhancement of consultation and regional co-operation in addressing the problem of illegal drugs trafficking which is closely linked with the prevailing violence.</P>
    <P>At the General Affairs Council of 9 April 2001, the EU reaffirmed its support for the peace process in Colombia, underlining that: </P>
    <P>&ldquo;Respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is a precondition for advancement in the peace process and a basis for EU support&rdquo;. In addition, Ministers observed that &ldquo;the Union also notes the ongoing efforts of the Colombian Government to counteract paramilitary activities and urges it to step up these efforts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These themes were also emphasised in the EU statement on Colombia to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 11 April and reiterated in the terms set out below in the EU statement to the International Meeting of the Support Group for the Peace Process in Brussels on 30 April:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The EU continues to strongly condemn atrocities, violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses committed by paramilitary groups and the guerrillas. The Union also notes the ongoing efforts of the Colombian Government to counteract paramilitary activities and urges it to step up these efforts. The Union calls upon the Government of Colombia to continue its efforts to effectively combat paramilitarism and to take concrete actions to dismantle these groups by arresting, prosecuting and punishing all those involved in such activities</P>
    <P>These key concerns will continue to underpin our policy toward Colombia, as well as our contribution to the framing of European Union policy, including the EU Programme of Support for the Peace Process in Colombia.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>In July last, my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, approved policy proposals for the investigation of sites for renewable energy based electricity generating stations in our offshore waters. I am informed there are four companies with licences to investigate the suitability of seven sites offshore for the construction of wind parks to generate electricity.</P>
      <P>There is up to £43 million provided in the national development plan to support renewable energy technologies generally. Any support measure specific to offshore development will require prior clearance by the European Commission under state aid rules. A standard condition of state aid applications is the submission of data on eligible costs and levels of aid intensity. This data can only be estimated under reasonable assumptions after the current exploratory works are concluded.</P>
      <P>I will discuss appropriate support measures with the industry with a view to submitting a proportionate support mechanism to the European Commission for clearance under state aids rules as soon as objective data from the exploratory works now under way is available.</P>

      <P>A major investment has already taken place to modernise the fleet of buses. In 1999, 20 new buses were put into service to replace old buses, while 30 new buses were put into service in 2000, of which nine were additions to the fleet. A further 36 buses are being ordered at present for provincial city services, for delivery later in the year. At least 14 of these buses will be allocated to services in Cork and a final decision with regard to the balance will be taken when they are delivered.</P>
      <P>The new buses for Cork are all low-floor wheelchair accessible and have considerably improved service reliability and passenger comfort.

      <P>
        <i>Unbundling of the Local Loop:</i>In December 2000 the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on unbundling of the local loop &ndash; Regulation (EC) No. 2887/2000 &ndash; was adopted and published, thereby mandating local loop unbundling in all member states from January 2001. In accordance with this regulation, an obligation to provide unbundled access has been imposed upon fixed public telephone network operators who have been designated by the national regulatory authority as having significant market power in the provision of fixed public telephone networks. In the case of Ireland, the obligation falls on Eircom.</P>
      <P>The implementation of, and supervision of compliance with, the regulation is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" />
      <i>EU Regulatory Framework for the Telecommunications Sector:</i>In July 2000 the European Commission adopted a package of proposals for a regulatory framework applicable to electronic communications infrastructure and associated services. The purpose of these proposals is to bring current Union legislation on telecommunications into line with the far-reaching changes that have taken place in the telecommunications, media and information technologies sectors. The convergence of these sectors underlies the approach to be taken by Ireland and other member states over the coming years to bring all transmission networks and associated services together under a single regulatory framework.</P>
    <P>The proposed regulatory framework comprises five directives on the harmonisation of legislation and a decision of the Parliament and of the Council on radio spectrum policy in the Union. The package of draft directives consists of a framework directive and directives on authorisation; access and interconnection; universal service and user rights; and data protection.</P>
    <P>Political agreement on the first three directives was achieved at ministerial level at the April Council of Ministers in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The Council working group is examining the first draft of the last two directives with a view to reaching political agreement at the June Council meeting. Transposition is expected to commence in the second half of 2001.</P>
    <P>Agreement on the decision on radio spectrum policy is expected before the June Council.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Legal Framework for electronic commerce:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I commenced the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000, by order on 20 September 2000. The purpose of the Act is to facilitate electronic commerce by providing for legal recognition of electronic signatures, electronic writing and electronic contracts on the same basis as conventional written paper forms. The Act, substantially implements the Electronic Signatures Directive 99/93/EC and goes some way towards implementing the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Infrastructure:</i>I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland. Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, IR£21 million was made available to support the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure to the regions.</P>
    <P>This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to IR£147 million. This funding will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services in the regions.The first call for proposals under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 closed on 22 September 2000. In January I announced the successful projects that will receive a total of IR£59 million in national <Col N="217" /> development plan aid. My Department is now reviewing future infrastructure investment needs in the light of the results of this first call for proposals.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Public Transport Liberalisation:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I published a consultation paper A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport' in September, 2000. This paper included a proposal to introduce liberalisation to the public transport sector by increasing private sector involvement in the provision of public transport.</P>
    <P>The Public Transport Partnership Forum is currently considering the proposals in the consultation paper. I will finalise my proposals when the Forum have responded to the consultation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Electricity Liberalisation:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Ireland has exceeded the requirements of the EU Electricity Directive, which required 28% market opening in February 2000, increasing to 33% by 2003. Under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, 31% of the electricity market is currently open in Ireland. This will be increased to 40% in 2002 by means of a Ministerial Order under the Act. Full market opening in 2005 has already been provided for in the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations, which I signed in December 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition, the &ldquo;green&rdquo; electricity market has been fully liberalised since February 2000 and more recently, I have introduced amending legislation to provide for full liberalisation of the CHP market.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gas Liberalisation:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The European Council has asked member states to speed up the process of liberalisation. I am happy to report that in Ireland, the level of gas market opening at 75% is far in excess of the 28% level required under the EU gas directive. Legislation is being prepared to extend the level to almost 85% increasing, from eight to 100, the number of customers entitled to third party access to the Bord Gáis Éireann network. My aim is to have the legislation enacted before the summer recess. Full gas market opening is scheduled for 2005.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Postal Liberalisation:</i>In May 2000, the European Commission circulated new proposals for the further liberalisation of the postal market for consideration by the member states These include proposals to reduce the maximum tariff and weight parameters of the reserved area within which the universal service <Col N="218" /> provider in each member state, An Post in the case of Ireland, has exclusive rights.</P>
    <P>At the Council meeting on 22 December last, I spoke in favour of a staged approach to liberalisation consistent with the position put forward by the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>At the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 4 April 2001, the Swedish Presidency announced that it would be seeking an agreement at the next Council due to be held in June on the next phase of liberalisation of the postal services market. To this end, the Presidency announced that it will be working to develop a compromise text which it hopes could form the basis of an agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Use and management of airspace:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Department is awaiting the formal proposals from the Commission in relation to the implementation of the high level group report on the creation of a Single European Sky.</P>
    <P>Presidency Conclusion &ndash; More and better jobs for Europe: developing an active employment policy. Education and training:</P>
    <P>The Department is committed to the training and development of its staff. There has been a sustained investment in the Department over the past five years in the development and training of its staff. The 3% of payroll target, set in Delivering Better Government, has been achieved and raised to 5%. The focus of the Department's training effort has been to lay foundations for change and to that end, training has concentrated on the development of individual staff members, in groups of their peers. Significant resources have also been invested in the third level fee refunds scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increasing employment in services:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Department facilitates work placements for third level students. The Department is committed to developing family friendly working policies to make it easier for employees to reconcile working life and family life. These policies include amongst others flexi time, term time, parental leave and other special leave schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Presidency Conclusion &ndash; Promoting Social Inclusion</i>The community application of information technology initiative seeks to fund demonstration projects, which encourage and assist those in our society who are unfamiliar with, and who do not use, the new information and communications technologies in their everyday lives. It is intended that the community and voluntary sector will undertake these projects. Over £2.5 million has been provided for this purpose from the Information Society Fund over the period June 2001 to December 2002.</P>
    <P>In excess of 450 proposals were received before the deadline, which expired on 15 February last. An independent steering group comprising representatives of the Department of Public Enterprise, other Departments and the private sector, is overseeing the selection process and will make the final recommendations for funding. It is expected that the results of the project selection <Col N="219" /> process will be posted to the voluntary groups involved in late May 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, IR£21 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Under this scheme, Eircom was supported in the provision of optical fibre cable along a 32 km link on a route connecting Galway and Castlebar, linking Westport, Aille, Ballinrobe, Kilconly, Kilmaine, Tuam and Claregalway. Indications from Eircom are that this project is completed. Completion of this project, among others, is being independently evaluated by consultants engaged by my Department.</P>
      <P>Other projects funded under the NDP 1994-99 involve the deployment of broadband infrastructure in Mayo. Esat's national fibre optic network was extended to Mayo covering the towns of Ballina and Claremorris. CMI, now Chorus, were assisted in the design and construction of a hybrid fibre coaxial infrastructure in Castlebar.</P>
      <P>Funding has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to IR£147 million. The allocation of this funding is the responsibility of my Department. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two thirds of the funding under this measure is being made available in the border, midlands and western region, which contains the county of Mayo. A first call for proposals was made in 2000 and in January this year I signed contracts which will further support the rollout of communi<Col N="220" /> cations infrastructure in the BMW region. Under these contracts, Chorus will bring additional services to the Ballina and Castlebar regions. Esat will provide wireless local loop services in the Castlebar and Ballina regions. Nevadatele will provide a regional e-commerce collocation point in Castlebar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cellular mobile industry undertakes research and development in mobile telephony technologies. This research and development has not been limited to reducing the size of the handsets but has covered various aspect of mobile technology including the antennae for the base stations. Antennae used at mobile telephony base stations can vary in size from large antennae to very small antennae. The latter could typically be smaller than the size of an alarm box on a domestic house.</P>
      <P>The industry is conscious of the need to reduce the impact of their masts and antennae on the environment and have adopted suitable approaches where it has been possible to do so.</P>
      <P>However, the demand for mobile phones has increased considerably over the past few years and this has influenced and increased the number of telecommunications antennae and masts that need to be installed. While the size of antennae used and the number of base stations deployed is a matter of detailed network implementation and is dictated by consumer demand and the available technologies, I will ask my officials to support any initiatives leading to greater industrial effort with respect to the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

These improvements relate to increasing supply, improving facilities at existing car parks, improved security and improved general management.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by CIE that no decisions in relation to charging rail passengers for parking at rail stations have been taken and no proposals have been submitted to the boards of Iarnród Éireann or CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 to 180, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the matter which is the subject of these questions previously by way of a parliamentary question on 3 April 2001 and on the Adjournment Debate on 5 April 2001. I welcome the opportunity to provide the Deputy with the further information which he is seeking, and to provide him with clarification of my previous replies.</P>
      <P>By 31 March 2001, 5,389 litigants who had been former members of the Defence Forces when they initiated their legal claim against my Department had been awarded compensation in respect of loss of hearing. The number of those who had left the Defence Forces more than 30 years ago is 537, while 2,402 had left the Defence Forces more than 20 years ago. Some 1,024 members of the Defence Forces who served less than five years have received compensation. As stated above, the number of claims settled in respect of discharged &ndash; that is, former &ndash; members of the Defence Forces is 5,389.</P>
      <P>When the Deputy raised this matter on the Adjournment, he had indicated that he had been dissatisfied with the reply he had received to his earlier parliamentary question on the matter. Notwithstanding the fact that this matter is before the courts, and that I am therefore limited in the extent to which I can discuss the case, my replies on this matter on both previous occasions have been as full and complete as were appropriate in the circumstances. When dealing with the matter on the Adjournment I provided as much additional information regarding the background to the claim in question as I was in a position to so provide. This included the information regarding the circumstances of the individual's discharge from the Army &ndash; a matter which is routinely investigated as part of the defence of the legal claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person to whom the Deputy is referring was discharged from the Army on 7 April 1966 having completed a nine year engagement. His discharge papers record the reason for discharge &ldquo;as a result of conviction by the Civil Power&rdquo;. The particulars of the offence which led to the conviction are further recorded on the person's conduct sheet, and accordingly I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the details of the conviction as recorded. Neither do I have any reason to doubt the accuracy of the date of discharge 35 years ago. I do not have any details available in respect of the individual whom the Deputy states was similarly convicted but who continued to <Col N="224" /> serve for a further 20 years. Paragraphs 58(f2&gt;m) and 58(f2&gt;o) of Defence Force Regulations A.10 deal with the question of the discharge of military personnel as a result of conviction by the Civil Power. I am arranging to have a copy of the regulations forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The claim from the person in question has been dealt expediently by the State at all times. The reasons for the delay in concluding the claim, as outlined during the Adjournment Debate, are outside the control of my Department. Indeed, I suggested in my reply on the debate that the person could participate in the early settlement scheme by instructing his solicitor in this regard. In all of the circumstances, I believe that it is reasonable to view my suggestion to enter negotiations under the scheme as optimistic progress for the person concerned in relation to the matter which the Deputy has raised.</P>

      <Quest>the total level of funding which is available within the Air Corps to support personnel who wish to engage in further studies in view of the financial assistance which is provided within the private sector to people who wish to improve their opportunities; his views on the need for his Department to radically increase funding for Air Corps personnel in order to provide an opportunity to avail of all third level courses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>With regard to courses undertaken by personnel in their own time, Air Corps personnel may apply for consideration for funding under the refund of fees scheme, on the same basis as all other members of the Permanent Defence Force. This scheme is operated on the same principles which are applied to funding of &ldquo;own time&rdquo;<Col N="225" /> courses in the public service in general. The military authorities advise that a figure of £7,500 has been allocated for refunds to Air Corps personnel under this scheme in the current academic year. A similar amount has been allocated for the Naval Service. The total allocation for the PDF under this heading in the current academic year is £56,000.</P>
      <P>A recent initiative is the promotion of foreign language study in the Defence Forces. A provisional budget of £10,000 has been provided for personnel who wish to undertake language education in any of the target foreign languages. Expenditure for Air Corps personnel on such training will be determined by the number of applications received from that Corps, as will be the case in the PDF in general.</P>
      <P>Funding for the education and training of Defence Forces personnel has, as its primary focus, the specific organisational needs and military requirements of the various branches of the Defence Forces. In the case of Air Corps personnel, many of the specialist &ldquo;in-service&rdquo; training requirements, such as pilot training, air traffic control training and technical aviation training, already involve a very considerable financial investment by the Department from public funds. This training and related service in the Air Corps also provide the recipients with very marketable qualifications and work experience. Indeed, a special service commitment scheme was introduced for certain Air Corps pilot officers in order to provide an incentive for the continued retention of such key operational personnel in service. In general, Air Corps personnel, in common with other Defence Forces personnel, are assigned to third level training where the specific training needs of the Air Corps indicate a requirement for such training and qualifications.</P>

      <P>The former Curragh Military Hospital was disestablished on 1 November 1998 as part of the re-organisation of the Defence Forces. The former Curragh Hospital was re-designated as a military medical facility and now provides military outpatient services and a small infirmary type facility for military patients. Former ward areas of the hospital have been either refurbished for other uses or are awaiting such refurbishment. In the circumstances, the question of providing public health service facilities at the Curragh for Naas General Hospital would not be feasible.</P>

A number of the occupants of the remaining 14 properties in the estate have indicated a wish to purchase but have not for one reason or another being able to make a firm commitment. The Chief State Solicitor has advised that contracts of sale for the houses in question are, at present, in the process of being issued to the purchasers' solicitors. To date, contracts have been issued in respect of 35 of the houses and this process is ongoing. It is expected that the first of the sales should be completed in the near future.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated in my reply to parliamentary Questions Nos. 105 and 108 on 10 April 2001, I have decided to dispose of some land at Gormanston camp, County Meath, to fund equipment purchases for the Defence Forces. The precise area to put on the market will be determined shortly. However, the military camp of 57 acres will not be disposed of.</P>
      <P>Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of the aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources.</P>
      <P>Proposals to establish a flying training organisation at Gormanston were considered by a steering group representing the Department of Public Enterprise, Department of Defence and the Irish Aviation Authority. A draft report was submitted in late July 2000. The question of establishing facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>I am in the process of arranging discussions with the relevant State agencies with a view to putting the property in question on the market at an early date.</P>
      <P>I had representations from one aviation group and I will be communicating with it in the near future.</P>

      <P>Up to 31 March, 2001 a total of 15,640 claims had been received from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. A total of 256 claims have been the subject of court awards with a further 7,422 being disposed of through out-of-court settlements. A further 375 claims were either withdrawn by plaintiffs or dismissed by the courts. A total of 7,587 claims are still outstanding. The sum of £100.4 million &ndash; 127 million &ndash; has been paid to date in damages and a further £43.8 million &ndash; 55.6 million &ndash; has been paid in respect of plaintiffs' legal costs.</P>
      <P>Following the judgment in the Hanley case which was delivered by the Supreme Court in December 1999, my Department, in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office and with the co-operation of the Law Society of Ireland, established an early settlement scheme, ESS, which initially operated on a pilot basis. By 31 March 2001, 1,423 claims had been settled under the scheme at an average of £6,500 &ndash; 8,250 &ndash; per claim. During the same period, the average amount at which claims were disposed of through the court process was £8,200 &ndash; 10,041. Significantly, the amount saved in respect of plaintiffs' legal costs is approximately £4,000 &ndash; 5,079 &ndash; per claim. It is important to stress that these savings in legal costs are in respect of the extra legal and witness costs incurred in bringing a claim to the steps of the court. All claims which have settled under the ESS involve legal representation on behalf of the plaintiffs.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 35 animals under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme. A cross check with the cattle movement monitoring system &ndash; CMMS &ndash; in October 2000 showed that five of the animals applied on were disposed of during the retention period for the scheme. Clause 22 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme requires an applicant to notify my Department of replacement details within ten days of the event. The person named failed to notify replacements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By letter of 23 October 2000, he was advised that the five animals were rejected from his application and that a reduction penalty would apply to the payment on his remaining eligible animals. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed and a letter was received by my Department from the person named on 5 December 2000 in which he provided details of replacement animals. In order to verify the eligibility of replacements an inspection was carried out on his herd on 30 January 2001 when it was found that a total of 16 animals applied on had been disposed of during the retention period for <Col N="231" /> the scheme. In addition, it was found that the person named did not replace these animals with other eligible animals.</P>
    <P>A copy of the inspection report, setting out the inspection findings, was given to the person named at the end of the inspection and my Department has also recently written to him advising that as the number of rejected animals is greater than 20% of the eligible animals no premium will be payable on foot of his application in accordance with clause 30 of the terms and conditions of the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme. He has been given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department, within 21 days, with any new information which may be of benefit to his case.</P>

      <Col N="232" /> I acknowledge the important role played by domestic abattoirs within the wider food sector and this has been reflected in the approach taken by my Department to establishments that have demonstrated a willingness to comply with the regulations. However, given that consumer protection must be our absolute priority, my Department has no option but to refuse to license those premises which are not prepared to achieve the minimum standard required.</P>
    <P>The submission deals with a request for financial aid. Financial aid for abattoirs falls within the ambit of the processing and marketing provisions of the EU guidelines for state aid in the agricultural sector. One such provision stipulates that aid may only be granted to enterprises that comply with existing minimum standards regarding hygiene, animal welfare and the environment. Therefore, while it is not possible, nor would it be appropriate, to provide funding to achieve minimum hygiene standards, possibilities do exist for financial aid in circumstances which involve rationalisation, research and development, human resources training and so on. In a series of meetings between my Department and the association representing small abattoirs, the criteria which would apply to such financial aid were outlined and the association was invited to submit proposals.</P>

      <P>My Department's database compiles certain data regarding groups and projects based on the most recent information from groups. The very extensive information sought by the Deputy spans 37 groups and some 10,000 projects nationwide. My Department will compile the information currently on the database regarding each project, comprising hundreds of pages, and will forward this by letter to the Deputy. The material will be forwarded as soon as possible. Should the Deputy require further information or clarification he is welcome to contact my Department.</P>
      <P>Under public financial procedures, the Comptroller and Auditor General can examine the accounts of Leader companies and make a report to the Committee of Public Accounts. In the operating rules governing Leader, the groups are apprised of the Comptroller and Auditor General access. As regards value for money, the Comptroller and Auditor General has examined the Leader programme and other local development initiatives, <i>inter alia,</i> finding Leader administration expenditure as acceptable.</P>

      <P>I have outlined my position in relation to producers in a similar situation as the named person on numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> As I have stated, this issue is extremely complex and has implications for the generality of milk producers in view of the limited amount of quota available. It is also the case that the State simply cannot be expected to take on legal responsibilities where they do not exist. The position is that no provision has been made in respect of any persons or group of persons who are not party to the proceedings in the Duff case and other associated cases. I have received legal advice to the effect that any proceedings that may be initiated by such persons are barred by the passage of time.</P>
    <P>However, notwithstanding this position and despite the fact that there is no legal obligation to go further towards meeting the demands of the producers in question, I have already indicated that I am prepared to look at what can be done in the context of the additional quota which became available as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement. I have consulted the various social partners in the industry on this issue and, specifically, the milk quota review group, which is representative of the main players. I will also have regard to the views of the Attorney General, given the complex legal issues involved, before I make a decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 215 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the pressures that have been building within the farming community as a result of continuing restrictions due to FMD. A meeting of the expert advisory group took place yesterday and its advice is that further adjustments can now be made in a number of areas, including that of the movement of stock bulls for breeding purposes from one holding to another, from 2 May 2001, subject to compliance with detailed protocols. I have accepted the advice of the group and movement of bulls may commence from 2 May 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming and its successor, which was introduced in November 2000, are both governed by EU Council regulations. Both regulations allow the early retirement pension to be paid only as a supplement to a national retirement pension. This means that any national pension a participant qualifies for must be deducted from his or her early retirement pension. As national pensions increase, either after annual budget increases or because of some change in an individual's circumstances, the rate paid under the early retirement scheme has to be reduced correspondingly. The rate of pension paid under the 1994 scheme is the maximum that the regulation allows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case referred to, an overpayment happened because my Department had not been informed that the participant was receiving a national pension as well as an early retirement pension. There is an onus on participants in the schemes to notify my Department when they first get a national pension and, subsequently, when it goes up because of budget changes or other <Col N="241" /> reasons. This helps to avoid overpayments of early retirement pensions which, as in this case, my Department always has to recover.</P>
    <P>Farmers can join the early retirement scheme from the age of 55 years. Unless they have a national retirement pension other than the old age pension, it is possible for them to draw down the full pension for a full ten years without any reduction.</P>

      <P>The systems investigation and training section of the intervention unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was established in 1992 as part of the restructuring of control operations in the area of beef intervention and beef export refunds.</P>
      <P>Since 1994 this work has been subsumed into the work of the beef controls division &ndash; BCD &ndash; under the direction of a senior superintending veterinary inspector. The BCD is responsible for ensuring that adequate and appropriate systems of control exist in those beef plants where beef market supports systems such as intervention, export refunds and purchase for destruction, are in operation.</P>
      <P>The beef controls division is also responsible for ensuring that the Department's officers in beef plants are fully informed of the requirements of the individual schemes. It organises conferences and training programmes for staff on a regular basis. The wider training needs of beef plant officers are the responsibility of the training unit of the Department.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 further significant upgrading of systems and controls has been put in place. The specific requirements of the accreditation process under EU regulation are being observed while documentary controls and the development of the internal audit function within the Department have also helped to increase the Department's control capability. The upgrading of the beef market support control work, which began with the establishment of the systems investigation and training section, has progressed significantly since 1992. The various systems are under constant evaluation for improvement.</P>

This strategy was presented and my Department and Bord Bia has been in regular contact since then in relation to the approach to be adopted for specific markets. Approaches have been made to reclaim all our markets and in some cases officials of my Department have travelled to meet their counterparts in the countries in question. Developments in relation to foot and mouth disease have presented further problems in relation to export markets, not only for beef but for pork products. Export markets for milk have been largely maintained following the FMD outbreak, based on the provision of heat treatment certification by my Department. No effort is being spared by me or my Department, along with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign <Col N="247" /> Affairs, through its embassies, to re-open any market which has closed to Irish products.</P>

The detailed terms and conditions of this phase of the scheme are currently being discussed with the relevant interests including farm organisations and licenced collectors. As regards the fees currently being charged by licensed collectors, this is a commercial matter between the farmer and the individual collector.</P>

The applicant claimed a total of 8.94 hectares but on inspection a total area of 7.00 hectares was found. This represents a difference of 1.94 hectares or 27%. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92 when the difference is more than 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore in this case as the over claim is greater than 20%, no area aid related payments can issue in respect of 2000. The question of <i>force majeure </i>does not arise in this case.</P>

My Department publishes the BSE statistics on a weekly basis and up to date figures are maintained on the Department's website. The underlying trend in relation to BSE remains positive.

      <P>The basis of rateable valuation for all properties, including sports clubs and community centres, is net annual value, NAV, i.e. the rental value of the property. Currently, land developed for sport such as playing pitches, golf courses, running tracks, tennis courts etc., is not liable for rates. However, buildings associated with any lands developed for sport, irrespective of whether they contain a bar or are used for other commercial activities are valued, entered on the valuation lists and are rateable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community halls are also valued and entered on the valuation lists as rateable property. The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, provides for local authorities to abate the rates in respect of community halls. The definition of community hall in the 1978 Act excludes premises containing a bar &ndash; a club registered under the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904 &ndash; and premises used for profit or gain. When a sports club or community hall is extended or improved the local authority refers the property for revision <Col N="254" /> of valuation to the Valuation Office. The Valuation Office, where appropriate, revises the valuation and amends the valuation list. An increase in the valuation does not affect the entitlement to relief under the 1978 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, I made significant changes to the stamp duty regime on transfers of residential property arising from the recommendations of the third Bacon report into the housing market. The Act introduced a three-tiered stamp duty structure for first-time buyers, owner-occupiers other than first time buyers and investors. I increased the exemption from stamp duty from £60,000 to £150,000 in the case of first time buyers of second-hand houses. Also, rates of stamp duty for first time buyers of second-hand houses at values in excess of £150,000 and up to £300,000 are now 25% less than for other owner-occupiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act also introduced a flat 9% stamp duty rate on all categories of investors buying new or second-hand residential property. In the light of developments in the housing market since last year, the Government decided to reduce the rate of stamp duty for investors in new property from this flat 9% and an amendment to this effect was introduced on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001, which applies to conveyances made on and from 27 February 2001. However, the investor rate for second hand properties will remain at <Col N="255" /> 9%. This change to the stamp duty regime will leave the investor rate unchanged in the second-hand market while reducing it somewhat for new property, thus providing a supply incentive in this area. Limiting the concession to new housing maintains the relative advantage of first time purchasers in the second-hand market which accounts for two-thirds of first time purchaser transactions.</P>
    <P>The following table outlines the stamp duty rates now applying to first time buyers of second-hand residential property.</P>

    <P>It should also be noted that there is no stamp duty on the sale of new residential property where the purchaser is an owner occupier and the house is not greater than 125 square metres. If a new house is more than 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged only on the site cost or a quarter of the value of the house, whichever is the greater. In such cases, the £150,000 exemption for a first time owner-occupier purchaser would also apply.</P>
    <P>In increasing the first time buyer limit from £60,000 to £150,000 and in giving a 25% reduction on the other owner-occupier category of rates applying between £150,000 and £300,000, I have responded fully, as recently as last June, to the needs of first time buyers. However, the position will be kept under review in the light of developments in the housing market.</P>

The report is a lengthy and complex document, and contains many wide-ranging and far-reaching recommendations regarding public service pensions generally. As the Deputy may be aware, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a working group of the public service unions, relevant Government Departments and other appropriate parties is to be established following Government consideration of the report to advise on the implementation of the relevant Government decisions with a view to introducing, as quickly as possible, any proposed changes in public service pension arrangements, including those for low paid workers. The Government will move to establish that working group when it has made its decisions on the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer has not paid income tax since 6 April 2001 as his weekly tax credits exceed the tax on <Col N="259" /> his income. The threshold for the health levy is £14,560 per annum or £280 per week. The health levy of 2 per cent is charged on a person's total income once their income is in excess of the threshold. The person to whom the Deputy refers has income in excess of £280 per week and consequently is liable for the health levy.</P>
      <P>I am aware of difficulties that can arise for taxpayers whose incomes increase to levels just above the threshold, sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;step effect&rdquo;. As I have stated in the past, it is my intention to address the whole area of PRSI and levies to see if the current complex structure of different allowances, thresholds, rates and ceilings could be rationalised and I will bear this issue in mind in the context of the next budget.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 258 and 259 together. Any body of persons or trust that wishes to become a tax exempt charitable body must apply to the Revenue Commissioners. To qualify for tax exemption the body of persons or trust must be established for charitable purposes only. While the tax legislation does not define what &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo; is, case law over the years has defined it as follows: 1. the advancement of religion, 2. the advancement of education, 3. the relief of poverty, and 4. other purposes beneficial to the community not falling within the other three categories.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 5,106 tax exempt charities and a list of these charities is published on the Revenue website www.revenue.ie. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that this list is updated on a quarterly basis to take account of both newly exempted bodies and of bodies who notify Revenue that they have ceased activities. Copies of the list are also available in diskette format from the charities section of the Revenue Commissioners in Nenagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the administration of the tax exemption and for monitoring the compliance with the tax exemption and I have no plans to change this arrangement. The regulation and monitoring of charities generally is a matter for my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I understand work has begun in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on examining the <Col N="260" /> current situation with a view to ensuring that comprehensive legislation on the regulation of charities and charitable fundraising is produced as a priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 2000 budget I made substantial changes to the capital acquisitions tax (CAT) legislation, to apply to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 December 1999. The measures include the introduction of &ldquo;dwelling house&rdquo; relief which provides that the transfer of a home will be exempt from CAT subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>The first condition is that the home is the principal private residence of the recipient and that the recipient has been living in the home for the three years prior to the transfer. Where the house has replaced other property, this condition may be satisfied if the recipient has continuously occupied both properties as his or her only or main residence for a total of three of the four years immediately prior to the transfer.</P>
      <P>The second condition is that the recipient must not have an interest in any other residential property, and the third is that the recipient must own and reside in the house for six years after the transfer. The relief will be withdrawn if the recipient sells or otherwise disposes of the house within six years. If the recipient sells the home within six years and invests some or all of the proceeds in a replacement home and continuously occupies both homes for a total period of six of the seven years, commencing on the date of the transfer, the tax will be limited to any proceeds not reinvested in the replacement home. This six-year condition will not apply to recipients over 55 years of age and provision will also be made for circumstances where the recipient is unable to comply with the residence requirement for reasons outside their control, for example as a result of hospitalisation or work obligations.</P>
      <P>If the above conditions are met, there will be no CAT liability on the transfer of a home regardless of the nature of the relationship between the disponer and the recipient. This relief is available in addition to the group III exemption threshold of £15,840 which applies to gifts and inheritances between non-relatives. If an individual has received previous gifts or inheritances since 2 December 1988 from a group III source, the value of these benefits must be taken into account for the purposes of determining the current, if any, liability to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that this particular measure should remove the tax burden on the home for many people, including those in family and personal relationships who are otherwise treated as <Col N="261" /> strangers under the CAT law. Any further tax relief for cohabiting couples may give rise to difficulty, for example any extension of the treatment given to married couples for tax purposes would involve recognising relationships in the tax code, which have not been recognised in the context of general law. In general, it is not appropriate for tax law to pre-empt general law.</P>
    <P>The significant package of measures contained in the 2000 budget constitutes the biggest single easement in the structure of CAT since its introduction in 1976. I consider that the &ldquo;dwelling house&rdquo; relief, taken in conjunction with other measures such as the single 20% rate, will reduce the CAT liability for all beneficiaries. I replaced the old higher rates of 30% and 40% with the single rate as I considered that the previous rates would have imposed a considerable burden in circumstances where the thresholds are exceeded by relatively modest amounts. I ruled against any further changes in the budget on account of Exchequer costs but the issue of CAT will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meeting of the European Council in March 2000, the European Union set itself a strategic goal over the next ten years of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. The Government has been responding to the Lisbon strategy in a number of ways at both EU and national levels.</P>
      <P>At EU level, my European colleagues and I have monitored progress in furthering the Lisbon objectives in the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers. My Department has contributed to the implementation of the Lisbon agenda at regular meetings of the EU Economic and Financial Committee and the EU Economic Policy Committee. This has included work on the financial implications of population ageing, the impact of the public finances on growth and employment, progress on a number of the priorities identified in the financial services action plan, and the identification of structural performance indicators to measure economic progress in achieving the Lisbon objectives. Much of this work is ongoing and a definitive date for completion of the work is not available.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department of Finance hosted a meeting of the EU Economic Policy Committee in Dublin in June 2000. The effectiveness of the Cardiff process, which monitors member states' progress with regard to liberalisation of product, capital and labour markets, was reviewed in light of the objectives agreed at Lisbon. In November 2000, the Department of Finance published the third annual progress report on the reform of product and capital markets in Ireland as a contribution to the annual country examination process under the Cardiff process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> At the national level, the Lisbon strategy correctly focuses on key issues of relevance to all member states such as ways in which Government tax and expenditure policies can boost growth and employment, the need for investment in human capital and research and development, as well as the need to prepare now for the financial implications of population ageing. In this respect, the Lisbon strategy in many ways complements and mirrors the Government's own policy priorities.</P>
    <P>As regards the impact of tax and benefit systems on employment, over the course of the past four years the Government has cut the higher and standard income tax rates by six percentage points each to improve the incentive to work and to contribute to the development of the economy. The Government has also radically improved the position of the lower paid in the tax system, so that now nearly 668,000 of the 1.7 million income earners in Ireland are outside the tax net.</P>
    <P>As regards investing in people and in research and development, the national development plan allows £13 billion, or one quarter of its funds, for employment and human resources. A total of £1.5 billion in the national development plan has been earmarked specifically for investment in research, technological development and innovation. As regards preparing for the implications of population ageing, we will be continue to allocate at least 1% of GNP annually to build up the National Pension Reserve Fund to provide for the public finance implications of population ageing. The decision to establish the fund represents a sound and far-seeing approach to budgetary planning. The amount in the fund already stands at over 6% of GDP.</P>

      <P>The tax incentives available under the seaside resorts scheme, as introduced in the Finance Act, 1995, were specifically designed to encourage the regeneration and improvement of 15 designated traditional seaside resorts throughout the State. The qualifying period for the scheme ended on the 31 December 1999. Incentives available under the scheme were intended to facilitate the development of tourist accommodation and facilities in the resorts. Continued eligibility for the rental incentives depends on the qualifying premises being let or leased to or occupied by any person for not more than two consecutive months at any one time or for not more than six months in any year. The scheme, therefore, was not seen as <Col N="264" /> a means of increasing the supply in the rented residential sector but rather to incentivise the supply of quality tourist facilities. To provide for an exemption of the nature requested by the Deputy would require a change in legislation governing the scheme but as the proposal would not be in keeping with the spirit and objectives of the scheme, I have no plans to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as a result of the signing of the new double taxation agreement with the US, Irish resident recipients of US social security pensions became exempt from US withholding tax on such pensions. The effective rate of this withholding tax had been 25.5% of the gross pensions when paid to a non-resident alien, as defined under US law, residing in Ireland. Many representations about the high level of the US withholding tax were received prior to the renegotiation of the tax agreement and the concerns were voiced by the Irish side in the course of the negotiations. In the end, the Irish side was successful in obtaining agreement to an exemption from the US withholding tax for Irish resident recipients.</P>
      <P>The agreement on the US side to grant exemption was conditional, however, on the pensions being subject to income tax in Ireland. The US did not want a situation to arise where the pensions would be exempt in both countries. Based on figures provided at the time to the Irish authorities by the US side, it was established that the majority of Irish recipients of such pensions would be net beneficiaries as a result of being liable to tax in Ireland instead of the US. Accordingly, the provisions of Irish income law that exempted US social security pensions from taxation in Ireland, if certain conditions were met, were changed in the 1998 Finance Act. US social security pensions are, therefore, liable to the normal Irish income tax rates of 20% and/or 42% depending on the level of income of the individual concerned. Irish resident recipients of US social security pensions are, of course, entitled to the normal tax-free allowances, credits and reliefs.</P>

      <P>I have no responsibility for INTRASTAT which is a project of EUROSTAT, an agency of the European Union, nor do I set out its procedures. Revenue has an ongoing policy of encouraging the use of electronic methods for the submission of data by traders. Revenue's VIMA office in Dundalk collects data for INTRASTAT. Currently 60% of data, by volume is submitted electronically to that office. Most of those taking up the electronic option, however, have been large or very large traders and consequently the number of traders who submit electronically is relatively small. In other words, the majority of INTRASTAT traders still submit their statistical data by means of the official paper form. Currently 1,274 traders submit their data on diskette.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the main compliance problem in INTRASTAT is ensuring traders submit their data, whether on diskette or on the paper form, on time each month. Many traders have to be constantly reminded of this requirement and the sending out of the form acts as a reminder. In fact, many traders have, in addition, to be telephoned, often more than once, to point out that their data for the previous month has not been received. The Central Statistics Office and EUROSTAT, on whose behalf the Revenue Commissioners collect these statistics, insist on adherence to very strict deadlines. Regular campaigns have been mounted over the years since the introduction of INTRASTAT in 1993 to explain to traders the importance of statistics both to themselves and to the Government and to encourage them to be more compliant.</P>
      <P>In the context of these compliance difficulties, the Revenue Commissioners decided to continue to issue the official INTRASTAT forms each month to all traders, including those who were submitting the data on diskette. In most companies, the arrival of the form from VIMA is the trigger which initiates a process of collation and submission of the requisite data. Another reason for adopting this approach is that the form is sent out with a pre-paid envelope and most electronic traders use this envelope to return their diskette to VIMA.</P>
      <P>It should also be pointed out that some traders, because they deal with their imports differently from their exports, submit their arrivals, or imports, data electronically and their despatches, or exports, data on the paper form. They need the official form which is bar coded and unique to the particular month, in respect of the latter. In addition, companies that usually submit returns electronically sometimes revert to the official month-specific bar-coded form when their system goes down or for some internal reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From their experience over the years, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that if the prac<Col N="266" /> tice of sending out the official form, which also acts as a reminder, together with pre-paid envelope was to be discontinued in respect of electronic traders, then the cost of reminder letters and phone calls to the many traders who would claim to have overlooked the matter would far exceed current expenditure.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that neither the taxpayer nor his employer informed the inspector of taxes when the taxpayer commenced employment. Consequently, a notice of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point was not issued for the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners are not aware of the specific tax arrangements being applied. The taxpayer should give his local tax office details of his employment as soon as possible to enable the inspector to issue a notice of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point to the taxpayer's employer. When the employer applies the tax credits on the notice to the taxpayer's earnings, the correct amount of tax will be deducted and, if appropriate, a refund of tax can be given.</P>

      <P>Section 62 of the 1998 Finance Act and section 486B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, introduced a new relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects. It was necessary to obtain EU Commission approval for the relief, which took about a year. The relief then commenced on 18 March 1999 and will last until 18 March 2002. I am informed by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners that, since its enactment six corporate investments totalling £15.35 million have been made under the scheme which involve an estimated Exchequer cost of about £4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> While there is no specific tax relief incentive for individuals investing in renewable energy projects, it emerged last year that individuals were making use of certain tax based leasing partnerships to invest in renewable energy projects so as to reduce their income tax liability. This loophole was closed off in the Finance Act, 2000, with transitional relief applying up to 28 February 2001 with the associated tax cost continuing for some years thereafter. The potential tax cost of such schemes could exceed £200 million, depending on the uptake. The question of a tax incentive for investment in renewable energy was discussed in some detail in the Seanad in the course of Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 20001. I indicated during this debate that I am prepared to look at incentivising people in this area, either through tax breaks or by way of a subsidy as the Government may consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the tax reliefs available in respect of moneys donated to charities. In this year's Finance Act I introduced a new scheme of tax relief on donations by either individuals or corporate bodies to eligible charities and certain other approved bodies. The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes that must be made in any year to any one eligible charity or approved body is £200, which is equivalent to £148 for the short tax year 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001. There is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An eligible charity is any charity in the State that has been granted exemption from tax for a <Col N="269" /> period of not less than three years and which is authorised by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of the new scheme. For the first time, this will allow tax relief for personal donations to domestic charities and all first and second level schools, as well as third level colleges and certain other bodies that had already been approved under other tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations will depend on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer or an individual on self-assessment or a company. In the case of donations from individuals, relief will be given at the donor's marginal rate of income tax. For a PAYE taxpayer, the relief will be given on a grossed-up basis to the charity or approved body, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor. If an individual who pays income tax at the higher rate of 42% wants to make a donation of £1,000 to an eligible charity, that person gives the charity £580. The charity will be able to claim a refund of £420 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year. Similarly, if a standard rate taxpayer makes a donation of £800 to an approved body, it will be able to claim a refund of £200 from the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year.</P>
    <P>In the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis, the individual will claim the relief and there is no grossing-up arrangement. Similarly, can claim deductions for donations as if they were a trading expense. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they will shortly be publishing a comprehensive explanatory leaflet on the operation of this new scheme and that copies will be circulated to all charities. I have also arranged that a copy will be sent to the Deputy. The cost of this new relief will depend on the number of donations and the amount involved. It has been tentatively estimated that the cost of this relief to the Exchequer will be £8 million in 2001 and £23 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The nursing careers centre, which is managed by An Bord Altranais, handles arrangements for the annual intake of students to the nursing registration diploma programmes. From this year, in line with a recommendation of the Commission on Nursing, the application system for places on those programmes is being administered by the Central Applications Office (CAO). I have been advised by An Bord Altranais that the interview for entry to nursing training was based on a pre-determined skills and experience questionnaire given to all applicants regardless of previous courses undertaken by the applicant.</P>
      <P>The discontinuation of the interview for school leavers was recommended by An Bord Altranais, as well as the Nursing Education Forum, in the context of the transfer of the application system to the CAO. The decision to discontinue interviews from this year affected all students and had no particular impact on one group of students. I understand from An Bord Altranais that pre-nursing courses accredited at level 2 by the NCVA are considered by some higher education institutions for admission to nursing. Decisions in relation to equivalencies are determined by admissions officers. Procedures are already in place to deal with pre-nursing level 2 courses. The establishment of formal links is a matter for the NCVA and the accreditation authorities for higher education institutions.</P>

      <P>It is vital that the techniques used in screening for cancer are proved to be medically effective and accurate before screening programmes, covering large segments of the population, are introduced. Reliable screening techniques for breast and cervical cancer are now well established internationally. I will keep the question of introducing screening programmes for other forms of cancer under review, having regard to the most up to date advice on the medical effectiveness of the available screening techniques. The National Cancer Forum, which advises me on all aspects of cancer services, has established a working group on cancer screening which will examine the issues and ensure that all relevant research is taken into account in arriving at a conclusion on the introduction of new screening programmes and techniques.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279, 292, 311 and 353 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any formal communication being received by my Department from the Irish Medical Organisation requesting that such a directive be issued to the health boards. As I have stated in several recent answers to questions relating to this area, all health boards are positively involved in currently examining their organisational processes to ensure their readiness to deal with the applications which will result from the budget provision. The issue of the dependants of persons aged 70 years and over is under active consideration at present. There are no plans to issue the cards automatically to qualifying persons. However, with the greater use of computerisation, for instance in the area of the drugs payment scheme, it may be possible for health boards to identify persons likely to benefit from this budget provision more easily in the future.</P>
      <P>My Department intends to embark on a public information campaign over the next few weeks to promote fresh awareness of the budget initiative and to inform those eligible on how they can avail of it. It is considered that a campaign at this time will have the greatest impact and it will be carried out in conjunction with the health boards. Newspaper advertising features, press releases and an insertion on the departmental website are the means being considered to achieve maximum coverage. Further, the relevant section in my Department will continue to give the fullest information available to any person making an inquiry on this subject either now or in the future.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation earlier this month on a number of outstanding industrial relations issues, through the HSEA. As a result, they agreed to meet my Department, again through the HSEA, on the subject of the extension of the eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over. I look forward to the positive outcome of these talks and the timely and efficient introduction of the scheme from its official start date, July 1 2001.</P>

    <P>*Data for 2000 is not yet available.</P>
    <P>While cervical smear testing is not currently provided by GPs under the scheme for medical card holders, such testing which is found to be necessary in the context of the individual woman's medical examination and clinical needs is available under the GMS scheme. Follow-up treatment is available to all women, including medical card holders, within the public hospital system.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that phase 1 of the national cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000. Under the programme, in the region of 67,000 women aged 25-60 years will be screened, free of charge, at minimum intervals of five years. The question of extending the programme to cover women outside the Mid-Western Health Board area, including those covered by the GMS, is currently under consideration by my Department in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards and the expert advisory group on cervical screening.</P>

      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances justify the award. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme (DCSS) and drug refund scheme (DRS). Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. I am satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place to meet the needs of persons with Alzheimer's disease and others with ongoing medical expenses.</P>

      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance continues to be provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Contacts with interested parties regarding the provision of a dedicated air ambulance service are ongoing, with a view to developing a consensus on the most appropriate role for air ambulances in the overall context of pre-hospital care.</P>
      <P>I have requested the pre-hospital emergency care council &ndash; PHECC &ndash; to advise me on the question of the provision of a dedicated helicopter emergency service for the transport of seriously ill and injured people to hospital who cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance. The council is presently considering the issue, including available literature on the use of helicopter emergency medical services. It is not possible at this stage to give an accurate estimation of when the council's considerations will be completed. It is important to acknowledge that an air ambulance service is only one element of an effective emergency medical care system. Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service in 1993 approximately £45 million has been provided for the implementation of its recommendations with over half of this funding provided by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> This has resulted in major improvements in the service including the training of ambulance personnel, changes in the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet, the development of command and control centres, the opening of additional ambulance stations and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas, on a pilot basis, to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
    <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre-hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service are to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency response resources.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland &ndash; FSAI &ndash; was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 January 1999 under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. The FSAI is a scientific agency whose function is to ensure that food produced, marketed or distributed within the State meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.</P>
      <P>According to the FSAI, pathogenic micro-organisms exhibiting multi-drug antibiotic resistance have been responsible for outbreaks of food poisoning in humans. However, the link between these multi-drug resistant pathogens and imported foodstuffs has not been made. At the end of 1999 the FSAI, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, started an enhanced poultry monitoring programme. The purpose of this programme, which was funded by the FSAI, was to monitor the quality and safety of poultry products circulating on the Irish market, and included a study of the incidence of antibiotic resistant campylobacter and salmonella in poultry meat both domestically produced and imported.</P>
      <P>This study was carried out in 2000, and approximately 3,000 samples of raw poultry meat and 700 samples of cooked products were examined. The results have not been collated but will be published within the next few months. In an extension to this project in 2001 the FSAI is funding further work with the isolates of campylobacter from last year's surveillance work. This exercise will involve genetically mapping the organisms isolated and comparing them to genetic maps of organisms that have been involved in human food poisoning outbreaks and also organisms that have been isolated from animal sources. This work may go some way to examining the link between foodstuffs and antibiotic resistant pathogens in humans.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, at the request of my Department, the National Disease Surveillance Centre has submitted a report making recommendations on the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland. The recommendations set out in the report are currently being examined with a view to implementation of same at health board level. In fulfilment of the European Commission's commitment to ensuring that the highest levels of health protection are offered to the European consumer, the Commission established the Food and Veterinary Office &ndash; FVO &ndash; in the directorate-general for consumer policy and consumer health protection in April 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal mission of the FVO is to monitor and control how member states and third countries implement EU legislation on food safety, <Col N="280" /> animal health, plant health and animal welfare, and to contribute towards the maintenance of confidence in the safety of food offered to the European consumer. The FVO fulfils this mission by carrying out a programme of inspections to monitor the performance of competent authorities, including audits and on-the-spot inspections of individual establishments in both member states and third countries. The FVO aims to ensure that imports into the EU are safe and produced under conditions at least equivalent to those in the EU. Directives and regulations set the standards to be met by animal products originating in the EU and also set down equivalent standards for imports.</P>
    <P>Strict rules governing the importation of animal products have been put in place at EU level, specifically for imports of poultry products from outside the EU. Countries wishing to export poultry products to the European Union are first required to demonstrate they have, and can maintain, safety standards at least equivalent to those applicable in the EU. In particular, the country of origin and establishment in which the poultry meat was produced must be approved in advance by the European Commission. Normally a country will only be included after the FVO has carried out an initial inspection of the control systems in the applicant country and has recommended that it be included on a list of approved countries.</P>
    <P>When a country has been included on an approved list it must provide a list of all establishments in that country that have been approved as meeting the required standards set down for export to the EU. It must present annual plans which demonstrate the official measures in place to detect levels of chemical residues, including antibiotics. The granting of approvals is dependent on such factors as the poultry health status of the country, adequacy of veterinary structures, facilities of the production establishment and employment of good hygiene practices. The rules governing the importation of food of animal origin into the European Union require that such imports must come through designated border inspection posts &ndash; BIPs &ndash; authorised and equipped to carry out specified checks and controls.</P>
    <P>On arrival in the EU, third country poultry meat is subjected to an official inspection at the first port of arrival. This includes checks on accompanying documents, on identity and labelling, as well as random physical checks on the product itself. If these checks indicate that everything is in order, importation is authorised and thereafter the poultry meat may circulate freely in the EU. Imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring in Ireland, because as a member of the European Union we are obliged under European legislation to allow free circulation of legally imported goods.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296, 301 and 321 together.</P>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Owen's question, pensionable allowances are taken into account at retirement where (a) actual moneys have been paid, and (b) contributions in respect of such payments have been made to the superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland concerning the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions and the 1999 nurses pay agreement. The Government intends to make formal decisions on the recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions following detailed consideration of the report which was published on 31 January 2001.</P>
      <P>With regard to the 1999 nurses pay settlement, the standard parity criteria whereby retired nurses benefit from adjustments made to the salaries applicable to the grades in which they served before their retirement continue to apply. The retired nurses association's concerns relate specifically to the senior staff nurse post, and to red-circled allowances payable to deputy nursing officers, theatre/night sisters and public health nurses.</P>
      <P>The senior staff nurse is a new post created as part of the 1999 settlement. Staff appointed to these posts will benefit from the rate for the post on retirement. The senior staff nurse rate does not however apply to pensioners who retired prior to 5 November 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the red-circled allowances referred to above, these allowances only apply to nurses who were in employment on the effective date, 16 November 1999. As pensionable allowances are only taken into account at retirement where (a) actual moneys have been paid, and (b) contribution in respect of such payments have <Col N="283" /> been made to the superannuation scheme, it follows that these allowances cannot be applied to pensioners who retired before the effective date.</P>
    <P>These issues have been raised by the Nursing Alliance and discussions have taken place under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency. In this context, my Department has confirmed with the Department of Finance that the approach being taken is consistent with public service pensions increase policy.

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of initiatives, a number of which have an impact on the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers. These include national mass media campaigns on anti-smoking, alcohol awareness and healthy eating. The unit also provides funding to the Irish Cancer Society in support of cancer prevention initiatives, including the yearly Europe Against Cancer campaign.</P>
      <P>Phase 1 of the national cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000. Under the programme, in the region of 67,000 women aged 25 to 60 years will be screened, free of charge, at minimum intervals of five years. The question of extending the programme to the rest of the country is currently under consideration by my Department in conjunction with the chief executive officers of the health boards and the expert advisory group on cervical screening.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000. Phase I of the programme covers the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, and the North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age.</P>
      <P>Decisions regarding subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable. The National Breast Screening Board is currently examining the proposal for the roll out of the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease recommends the <Col N="286" /> development of centres of excellence for the specialist treatment of breast disease. The report refers to the strong evidence which exists that women with breast cancer are at a lower risk of relapse and have a better opportunity of long-term survival if they are treated in a multidisciplinary setting.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I allocated £4.35 million from national cancer strategy funding in the current year for the treatment of symptomatic breast disease, including £4.115 million to enable the development of centres of excellence to commence in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, Portlaoise General Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Waterford Regional Hospital, University College Hospital Galway and the Southern Health Board area. The development of centres of excellence for the treatment of breast disease will continue over a period of a number of years and will form part of the next phase of implementation of the national cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>I am committed to providing the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have cancer.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to bring proposals to Government regarding whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most <Col N="288" /> direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
    <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as you can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Regarding the particular case raised by the Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Kerry area is a matter for the Southern Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under legislation, the issuing of medical cards to eligible persons is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. In making such decisions, chief executive officers have regard to income guidelines as well as to any other individual factors relevant to the decision. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's <Col N="290" /> income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget will not lead to medical card holders losing their medical cards and have expressed my concern in this regard to the health board chief executive officers. The position regarding couples on invalidity pensions, as referred to by the Deputy, is that their medical card eligibility will continue to be assessed in the normal manner and I am satisfied that the situation of these couples is capable of being appropriately dealt with under the current eligibility arrangements. In addition, in the budget 2001 package, the Government announced its intention to extend the eligibility for a medical card to all persons aged 70 and over regardless of means to come into effect on 1 July 2001.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that in keeping with the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operations of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The health board chief executives have indicated the review will be concluded by mid-year. I understand that the area of income guidelines will form part of the review.</P>

      <P>The commitments of the Lisbon Summit concerning economic reform do not require any specific measures to be undertaken in areas under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>The strategic aims of strengthening employment, economic reform and social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy, enunciated at Lisbon, are supported by my Department. In particular, the European Council's views on strengthening co-operation between member states in the areas of modernising social protection and promoting social inclusion are of interest to my Department. In these areas, the Council favours exchange of experiences and best practice through: improved information networks; promotion of social inclusion in member states' health policies; together with targeting of specific population groups for priority actions as indicators for progress. This is very much in keeping with the approach we are taking to the strategic planning of the health services in the preparation of the new health strategy.</P>

      <P>The issue of alcohol advertising is a complex one which I am currently examining. A number of actions have been taken which are relevant to this issue. These are as follows. First, research into the impact of alcohol advertising on young people has been commissioned by the health promotion unit of my Department. The results of this research will be available shortly and will inform future action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I have asked the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland to include some new recommendations in its updated advertising code. These include: that the content of advertising should not create the impression that alcohol drinking contributes to social and sexual success; that the placement of alcohol advertising should not be permitted in the media where more than 25% of the audience is under age; that those who <Col N="292" /> promote or advertise alcohol on line should provide mechanisms for parents to prevent their children's access to that advertising; and that advertisers of alcohol should avoid content that is attractive to under age customers and should post educational messages about responsible drinking.</P>

      <P>One of the proposals put forward for consideration for funding by the regional planning and consultative committees in 2001 was from the Brothers of Charity Services to establish a post of domiciliary nurse for its Mahon and Ballincollig clinic services. It was envisaged that the post would provide a quality home-based service to babies and children under three years and their parents and be divided between the Mahon and Ballincollig child development centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the list of priority developments which had been identified by the committees for funding was reviewed, it did not prove possible to provide funding in 2001 for the above mentioned proposal. I understand from the Southern Health Board, however, that the Brothers of Charity Services is currently in the process of reviewing other <Col N="293" /> measures to address this need and that the situation will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>In April 1998 my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, announced the phase 2 development of University College Hospital, Galway. This will see the development of the hospital as a major regional centre providing the range of specialities associated with a university teaching hospital. The tender for this contract was signed on 23 June 2000 and work has commenced. The phase 2 development provides for cardiac surgery, radiotherapy and trauma orthopaedic facilities, a burns unit, additional ICU beds, an MRI unit, a new medical social work department and a new concourse to include administration and admissions. The establishment of neurosurgery facilities at the hospital is not envisaged at this time; however, the appointment of a second consultant neurologist at the hospital was approved in January 2000.</P>
      <P>From a national perspective, I have asked Comhairle na nOspidéal to initiate a review of neurology services which will focus on updating their 1991 report on neurology services, taking into account: various papers published since the 1991 report in relation to the development of neurology services; recent advances in the provision of services; and an increasing demand for a structured approach to post-operative care and rehabilitation. The comhairle review will be of assistance in reaching decisions on the further development of neurology services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323 and 325 together.</P>
      <P>The drug refund and drug cost subsidisation schemes were merged into the drugs payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit on 1 July 1999. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, to be user-friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increase in the threshold, the position is that the new threshold refers to family expenditure as opposed to the previous threshold in the DCSS which related to individual expenditure. In addition, I would point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity regarding the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. Prior to the introduction of the common list, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme &ndash; generally over the counter products such as cough bottles, vitamins, shampoos etc. &ndash; were reimbursable under the drugs cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of these medicines as the old schemes, particularly the drug refund scheme, were not computerised, and the list of items reimbursed is not available. I am satisfied that the common list provides a comprehensive range of the most modern therapies. My Department is currently reviewing the list with a view to making some additional products available. The list is subject to ongoing review and amendment as new products become available, and is updated on a monthly basis.</P>

The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, to be user-friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families <Col N="295" /> and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

The list is subject to ongoing review and amendment as new products become available and is updated on a monthly basis. I am satisfied that the common list provides a comprehensive range of the most modern therapies.</P>
      <P>In order for any item of medicine to be included in the common list, it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. One of the criteria stipulates that the product should be one which may be used under the supervision of a general medical practitioner and which is not restricted to hospital or medical specialist use. In the case of Deltasoralen tablets, the product authorisation issued by the Irish Medicines Board states that it should be given by specialists with adequate controlled facilities familiar with the precautions necessary. My Department is therefore of the view that this product is more suitable for use in a hospital setting. In general over the counter products such as Tarpomade are not included in the common list.</P>

      <P>My Department's immunisation policy is based on the advice of the national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee recommends that MMR vaccine be administered at 15 months with a booster dose administered at four to five years of age. The committee has advised that the MMR vaccine has been demonstrated to be very safe and effective and it concluded that there was no evidence to discontinue MMR in favour of the separate components of the vaccine.</P>
      <P>The MMR vaccine is available free of charge from family doctors under the primary childhood immunisation programme and there is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this scheme. On the basis of currently available information there is no evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccines. Splitting the MMR vaccine into separate components would involve extra injections for children and would cause both children and the people with whom they come in contact to be exposed to these potentially serious diseases for a much longer period of time.</P>
      <P>The information currently available to my Department is that separate measles and mumps vaccines are not available in this country.</P>
      <P>The international consensus, including the World Health Organisation, is that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective and this is supported by a number of well-validated studies on this issue.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge parents to have their children immunised with the MMR vaccine in accordance with current recommendations. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their GP before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>I am most concerned about the recent publicity in the media concerning the use of symphysi<Col N="299" /> otomy in obstetrical practice in the 1950s and 1960s. As a consequence, the chief medical officer, CMO, at my Department has asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to examine the issues raised and to report back to him as soon as possible. I will revert to the Deputy when the findings of the institute become available and have been considered by the CMO.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the use of specific chemicals as pesticides has increased in recent years. Pesticides are used mainly for cereals, field crops and horticultural crops. Monitoring of pesticide residues in food is carried out by specialist laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. That Department's pesticide control service undertakes detailed sampling and analysis of foodstuffs to ensure compliance with maximum residue levels laid down under EU legislation. The Environmental Protection Agency also carries out some monitoring of dioxin levels in cows milk. Dioxins are chemical <Col N="302" /> by-products, a number of which can be toxic to humans.</P>
      <P>With regard to genetically modified crops, the implementation of EU directives and national regulations are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency. The fundamental objective of these directives and regulations is the protection of people and the environment and the EPA is the competent national authority for the purposes of ensuring compliance with these regulations. The EPA is also involved in developing a research programme on safety issues in relation to the release of genetically modified organisms to the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 344 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is the intention of <Col N="303" /> my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one-fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
    <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from the 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In response to the Deputy's inquiry about the Mid-Western Health Board, I am advised by the board that, to date, approximately 300 cases have been identified as having been affected by the provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters to contribute to the cost of their parent's care. The board informs me that current estimates suggest that the cost of making payments to those adversely affected by this provision will be approximately £1.63 million.</P>

      <P>I have expressed my concerns surrounding the excessive consumption of alcohol on numerous occasions. The health promotion unit of my Department is involved in several measures aimed at addressing some of these problems.</P>
      <P>Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol. Children are targeted through the substance misuse prevention programme called Walk Tall which was developed and delivered in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science, the health boards and teachers. Some 95% of primary schools have received training in this programme. Adolescents are targeted through the substance abuse prevention programme, SAPP, called On My Own Two Feet which will form part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. To date, two-thirds of post primary schools have received training in this programme. The SAPP programme is also available for youth leaders working in local communities and at risk youth groups. Training is available for professionals and parents at community level through the regional health boards, with the purpose of helping long-term prevention of alcohol and drug misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A training initiative developed in association with the drinks industry on the responsible serv<Col N="308" /> ing of alcohol, RSA, has been established. This is a training course for those in the pub trade and hospitality industry and was developed in co-operation with the drinks industry group and CERT. Some of the issues addressed in this programme are the prevention of serving those under-age, those who are going to drink and drive and those who are already intoxicated.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit commissioned the first national lifestyle surveys, Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition, SLÁN, and Health Behavior in School Aged Children, HBSC. They provide a profile of health-related behaviours including current drinking patterns. The first report was published in 1999. Follow-up surveys will be conducted at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>Research is currently being carried out in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people, the results of which are expected in the near future. This research will inform future policy in this area.</P>
    <P>A new campaign aimed at young high risk drinkers has been launched. This campaign emphasises the choices open to young people and promotes a healthier lifestyle. The alcohol awareness campaign carries the slogan, Less Is More &ndash; It's your Choice. It promotes alternative activities to drinking and encourages people to examine their lifestyle.</P>
    <P>As part of the less is more campaign, the health promotion unit of my Department held a special seminar which was attended by over 100 stakeholders; health professionals, youth groups, teachers, parents, community groups, vintners and gardaí. At local level, the Department is working with youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people. Many of the health boards have already developed successful programmes to tackle some of the issues, and my Department will be supporting the continuation of these.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of ambulance services in the southern region, which includes Killarney, rests with the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Government policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is as set out in a number of policy documents, most notably the report of the review group on the ambulance service, which was published in 1993 and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group, addressed, <i>inter alia</i>, the issue of the level of cover currently being provided by ambulance crews and made recommendations on how improvements might be made. Significant progress has been made by the Southern Health Board on the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the review group. This progress has been facilitated by special development funding from my Department to the board of in excess of £3 million in recent years. Much of this investment funding has been directed by the board towards improvements, on a phased basis, in the level of duty hours cover in all of the board's ambulance stations. The board's service plans continue to address the issue of increasing the level of in-station duty hours cover with a subsequent reduction of on-call hours cover.</P>
      <P>The board's five year development plan for its ambulance service, 1997-2002, identifies the need to improve the level of emergency ambulance cover in a number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2000, the board embarked on a phased plan to further extend the on-duty cover in the 16 stations outside of Cork and Tralee area and Killarney was prioritised for this development to take place this year with the addition of an ambulance and an extra crew. The additional <Col N="310" /> resources to effect this improvement on the service in Killarney will enable the board to extend the level of in-station duty cover to 1 a.m. each day. The other stations identified are Mallow and Midleton.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are at an advanced stage between the board and the staff side to agree the early implementation of the new roster in Killarney. Ongoing discussions are taking place with the staff members in Killarney with a view to implementing the necessary improvements to the service there and in addressing the concerns of the staff with the issue of reducing the level of on-call cover and ensuring that a period of on-call duty at night is not followed by duty the next day.</P>
    <P>The board is fully satisfied that the new rostering arrangements currently being discussed will ensure the service in the Killarney area will be improved in the most effective way, directing the additional resources to where they are most needed, to serve the community of Killarney.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the further development of this vital service in the context of the recommendations of the 1993 report, the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy and in response to the priorities identified by the health boards. I will, therefore, continue to provide additional resources for the continuing development of the emergency services nationally to ensure that those calling on the service continue to receive timely and appropriate care.</P>

      <P>Under legislation, the issuing of medical cards to eligible persons is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. In making such decisions, chief executive officers have <Col N="311" /> regard to income guidelines as well as to any other individual factors relevant to the decision. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his\her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The operation of the medical card scheme is currently the subject of a review being carried out by the health board chief executive officers in keeping with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on removing anomalies as well as on the needs of families with children and on barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the health board chief executive officers' group has been requested to ascertain if income under the £6,000 rent a room scheme, as outlined in the Finance Act 2001, will have an impact on income limits, and I will respond to the Deputy immediately on receipt of this information.</P>

      <P>Health boards have responsibility for the prioritisation and delivery of capital projects within their area, under the national development plan. My Department is reviewing the plan and this review includes the implications this year of the funding adjustments recently announced in the revised Estimates for the public capital programme, in addition to other significant influences governing the NDP, such as inflation and capacity pressures in the construction industry. My Department recently held discussions with each board and the ERHA on the NDP.

      <P>Each capital project approved under the NDP continues to be subject to the normal service, technical and other criteria required by my Department in the context of maximising the overall funding available for the plan. A number of new capital projects were approved by my Department in 2000 for the South Eastern Health Board area, in addition to the existing projects and initiatives already in place and which were also funded under the national development plan. Where individual projects were approved, but did not proceed as envisaged, these are liable to carry forward to subsequent years of the plan on the basis that they are prioritised and delivered within the overall funding available each year to the board.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Centre for Independent Living has recently <Col N="315" /> published its five year strategic plan Beyond the Social Model &ndash; Actions not Words which sets out the organisation's work programme for 2001-2006. The plan focuses on human rights and equality and aims to develop strategies and mechanisms to ensure that positive outcomes are obtained for all people with disabilities. The work of the independent living movement, as it relates to the health sector, is in the provision of personal assistance services. There are currently 26 Centre for Independent Living branches providing personal assistance services throughout Ireland. The Independent Living Network has recently been established to act as an umbrella organisation for all the centres for independent living.</P>
      <P>Health boards provide a range of support services, either directly themselves or by funding a non-statutory organisation, such as a Centre for Independent Living, to provide the service on their behalf, to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community. This range of services includes respite care, day care and home support services which includes home helps, home care attendants and personal assistant services. The provision of a service is most appropriately based on the individual's needs, which may not always be met by a personal assistance service. My policy is, therefore, to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the amount of funding allocated for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and having particular regard to the desirability of taking an equitable approach in addressing the needs of all people with disability who require various levels of support. The amount allocated by an individual health board in any year is decided in the context of local needs and in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and consumers are represented on the co-ordinating committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government took office, additional funding totalling just over £107 million has been allocated for the maintenance and development of services, including personal assistance services, to people with physical and sensory disabilities. In the budget, an additional £12 million this year, rising to £24 million in the year 2002, was announced for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. I decided that of this, £5 million, rising to £10 million in the year 2002, is to be targeted at home supports, including £2.5 million with a full year cost of £6 million for personal assistance services. This means that over the next two years, funding is being provided for an additional 312 personal assistants, to provide a service to approximately 230 clients. Including the £10.5 million already invested in these services since 1997, a total of £20.5 million ongoing funding is being made available for the home support services, including personal assistance services. I believe that this level of funding is indicative of the Government's <Col N="316" /> ongoing commitment to the development of the broad range of home support services which are required to enable people with physical disabilities to live as independently as possible and also to provide relief to a significant number of carers.</P>
    <P>The Centre for Independent Living has campaigned in the past for the establishment of an independent living fund and in their strategic plan they are proposing a direct payment scheme to allow people with disabilities to pay for their personal assistant service directly. The independent living fund or direct payment scheme is no more than a particular model for funding a personal assistance &ndash; PA &ndash; service. The important thing is that the service itself be provided to those needing it. A properly structured PA service needs to have a formal assessment procedure to assess the level of dependency of the individual with a disability and the suitability of the person to manage a PA. This might be done by the health boards as part of a structure for assessing the precise service needs of each individual with a physical or sensory disability, with perhaps a further assessment carried out jointly with the agency providing the PA service to the health board. It is envisaged that the health boards would broker the service, contracting with one or more service providers in each board's area, who would hire and pay the personal assistant. A working group will be established later this year to fully assess the home support, including personal assistant services.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by a representative from the Centre for Independent Living and representative of a number of non-statutory organisations, independent leaders and FÁS was established in 1998 to develop a generic personal assistant training course. The FÁS national traineeship unit, in conjunction with the city centre training centre, have established a personal assistant traineeship steering group to bring this work forward. Officials from my Department have recently been invited to serve as representatives on this steering group and will be attending the next meeting.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department have met with their counterparts from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to discuss the mainstreaming of the personal assistance services, currently being provided by means of the FÁS community employment scheme and discussions on this matter are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Finally, officials from my Department have organised to meet with representatives from the Independent Living Network later this month, to discuss a number of issues, including the organisational structures for the centres for independent living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most concerned by the reported cancellation of chemotherapy services at the Mater Hospital. I have asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to investigate this matter and to revert to me, and to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency. Services for eligible patients at the Mater Hospital are provided under an arrangement with the authority.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review is now at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>In parallel with this review, the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; recently completed a comprehensive acute bed needs assessment for its region. The study identified a requirement for 1,276 additional acute beds by 2011 to meet increasing demands. The objective of the ERHA review was to determine whether additional acute beds are required within the eastern region based on good standards of efficiency, population characteristics and medical/healthcare developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ERHA review also identified a need to increase the number of non-acute beds for the care of older people in the region. This is seen as <Col N="318" /> essential in order to allow for increased capacity and throughput in acute hospitals. The work of the ERHA will inform the preparation of a national assessment of bed requirements.</P>
    <P>Under the winter initiative, I was pleased to provide funding of £9.485 million to the ERHA to help alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter periods 2000-2001. This funding was targeted at a number of key service areas including contracting of private nursing home beds, enhanced discharge planning and bed management, provision of aids and appliances for use by older people, accident and emergency winter initiatives, contracting of places for young chronic disabled persons and contracting of places for young chronic behaviourally disturbed persons.</P>
    <P>The contracting of private nursing home beds allows for earlier discharge of patients from the acute hospitals for convalescence purposes. Typically, patients admitted to private nursing homes will require short time care in a more appropriate setting prior to discharge home, thereby freeing up acute hospital beds for more acute medical and surgical admissions. My Department has been informed by the ERHA that 375 private nursing home beds have been contracted up to 2 April in response to demand.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, this Government is committed to investing £1 billion for the development of acute hospital services. I am satisfied that this investment will improve the capacity of the acute hospital sector to respond to increased demand for services over this period.</P>

      <P>In introducing the new taxi licensing regime, the Government undertook to address, as a mitigating measure, the question of high fees paid, under earlier arrangements, to certain local authorities for the grant of taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences. Instructions were subsequently issued to licensing authorities by my <Col N="321" /> Department in February, 2001, for the refund of certain taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licence fees on the basis of the difference between the default fees specified in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995 &ndash; £3,000 for an ordinary taxi licence, £100 for a wheelchair accessible taxi licence &ndash; and any higher fee received by a licensing authority prior to 21 November 2000. This measure is designed particularly to benefit holders of wheelchair accessible taxi licences which account for the great majority of taxi licences issued between 1995 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The Government's undertaking in relation to mitigation did not extend to fees paid for the transfer of taxi licences and no retrospective measures are envisaged in this regard.</P>

Terminal destinations on the national routes are towns, cities or ports at the terminal of national routes or, for the convenience of road users, at the terminals of the extended route in the case of cross border routes. Formal designations of national routes under the Roads Act, 1993, relate solely to roads within the national jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>At present the N3 terminates in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and accordingly, I am advised that the destination signage on leaving Dublin indicate this. Enniskillen is also mentioned on these signs, first, due to the fact that it was the original terminal destination prior to the N3 being extended to Ballyshannon and, second, to inform road users that in order to reach Ballyshannon using this route a crossing of the Border with Northern Ireland will be required. In the case of the N2, the terminal destination is Derry.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority &ndash; NRA &ndash; has assumed direct responsibility for the provision of directional signage and delineation on national roads. Issues arising in this connection may be appropriately addressed to NRA.</P>
    <P>In its role of oversight of the non-national roads programme, my Department issued a circular letter to road authorities in August 1998 emphasising the importance of providing and maintaining a high standard of road signage. My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads, which issued on 5 February 2001, again reminded local authorities of the need to bring their signage on the non-national road network up to the standards of the traffic signs manual. This memorandum also reminded local authorities of the need to provide road signposting so as to assist foreign tourists at points of entry to the country and to remedy any deficiencies in this regard as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages significant private sector investment in national road development &ndash; £1 billion of the £4.4 billion provided for national road improvements in the NDP is to be sourced from private finance through public private partnership financing.</P>
      <P>In addition to the three pilot national roads projects already identified in the plan, the National Roads Authority has announced a further eight PPP schemes for the national road network. The total construction costs of the 11 schemes is £1.2 billion (1.5 billion) and it is expected that these schemes will attract potential private finance of £700 million (900 million).</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Roads Act, 1993, it is a matter for the National Roads Authority to promote the detailed programming of the work required for the NDP and to manage in co-operation with local authorities &ndash; and the private sector in the context of public private partnerships &ndash; the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>

      <P>Detailed guidelines on minimising the risk of cryptosporidium in water supplies were issued to local authorities by my Department in 1998. The guidelines were prepared in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Environmental Protection Agency. Authorities were requested to review, in light of the guidelines, their action plans and training programmes, to cover the potential risks associated with cryptosporidium with a view to ensuring that good prevention measures, including good management practices, are in place in relation to the ongoing protection of drinking water supplies.</P>
      <P>Further measures to minimise the risk of cryptosporidium will be considered in light of the outcome of an EU funded research project which is currently being undertaken by Teagasc. The results of the project will be of major benefit in determining the risk posed by cryptosporidium and how the risk can be reduced by the implementation of practical control measures. Research on control measures, which is part of the project, will focus on the use of new procedures for the inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum in water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 404 and 405 together.</P>
      <P>Information on the number of telecommunications masts or antennae which have been granted planning permission by local authorities is not available in my Department. Such information would be held by each individual planning authority in its planning register. Neither does my Department have information regarding masts or antennae which are exempted development and therefore did not require planning permission. My Department published guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structure in July 1996. The guidelines were issued to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications antennae and support structures within the planning system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of temporary masts and antennae, Class 29 of Part I of the Second Schedule of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, exempts certain development by licensed telecommunications <Col N="332" /> operators from the requirement for planning permission. In particular, class 29(h) exempts 'transportable radio links' subject to a number of conditions, one of which is that the link shall be removed from the land on which it is provided not later than twelve months from the date on which it was provided. The provision in question is being examined as part of the general review of the exempted development regulations made under the planning Acts. Work on these regulations, which require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, is now at an advanced stage and I propose to publish these regulations and submit them to the Oireachtas within the next month.</P>

      <P>The Lisbon Summit focused on a strategy to strengthen employment, economic reform and social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy. Progress in implementing its commitments will be reviewed at each spring European Council. The conclusions of the Stockholm Summit in March this year add further commitments to the Lisbon agenda in relation to sustainable development, requiring that the sustainable development strategy, including the environmental dimension, to be adopted at the Gothenburg European Council in June this year, will complete and build on the political commitment under the Lisbon strategy.</P>
      <P>At its Spring meeting in 2002, the European Council will review progress in implementing the sustainable development aims in to the Lisbon Strategy, as well as the contribution that the environmental technology sector can make to promoting growth and employment. My Department, in consultation with other Departments and agencies as appropriate, will continue to address sustainable development issues within the framework of the national sustainable development strategy and subsequent strategies including the national climate change strategy, the National Spatial Strategy, in preparation, and having regard to the emerging EU strategy for sustainable development.</P>

      <P>The first town boundary alteration, Killarney, to be effected by any Minister in recent years was implemented from 1 January this year. Castlebar and Ballina are the next cases for consideration and are currently being examined by my Department; the relevant applications were received in May and December 1999. An application for Westport was received last week. The examination of these three cases will take account of the financial, planning and other considerations both as regards the towns concerned and the cumulative impact of these proposals for the county council. Once this assessment has been completed, and the objective would be later this year subject to the supply of any data which may be required, a decision can be made on the boundary alterations. Any boundary alteration would come into operation from the start of the next financial year.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing the scheme do not stipulate that authorities obtain a medical report or an occupational therapists report. However, authorities generally require such reports to ensure that the most appropriate works are carried out to meet the needs of the applicant and that the potential long-term needs of the applicant are addressed having regard to their disability. It is a matter for the local authority to determine the level of grants in individual cases, the circumstances in which a grant may be paid and to ensure that there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled persons grants.</P>
      <P>I have improved the terms and conditions of the scheme on three occasions since 1997 with the effective maximum grant now £16,000, double what it was in 1997. In the case of a private house, the grant may now cover 90% of the approved cost of the work while the full cost of the works are covered in the case of a local authority house. In December 1998 I also increased the rate of recoupment by my Department to local authorities under the scheme from 50% to two-thirds of the grant paid. I continue to urge local authorities to operate the scheme in a flexible and responsive manner having regard to the needs of the applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 and 415 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. Driver training is available at present from private motoring schools, many of whose instructors are registered with the voluntary driver instructor register, which has been financially supported by my Department.</P>
      <P>Education and information is recognised in the safety strategy as being vital to forming good road safety habits in younger people who are the adult road users of the future. The National Safety Council is developing special material and programmes for the post primary sector that will focus both on safe road use by teenagers and the future responsibilities of young people as drivers. The council also regularly targets young drivers in its public media campaigns.</P>
      <P>My Department was represented on a task group set up by the NCCA in autumn 2000, at the request of the Minister for Education and Science, to look at this whole area of driver education. I understand that the task group has submitted its report to the Minister for Education and that its recommendations are being examined. My Department is also supporting an initiative taken by a school in Crumlin which arranges driving lessons for students in the course of their leaving certificate course, by arranging block bookings of driving tests for students who have taken driving lessons in the course of their leaving certificate course. All such students would be over 17 years of age and have provisional licences. Students in transition year are not normally more than sixteen years of age and could not be facilitated in the same way.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August 2000. As I explained previously in replies to the Deputy's question of 30 January, 2001, because of the scale and complexity of the provisions of the Act, and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. Three commencement orders have already been made bringing a number of Parts of the Act into force on 1 November 2000, 1 January 2001 and 17 April 2001.</P>
      <P>The next tranche of regulations which are currently being prepared by my Department will enable me to bring the development control provisions of the Act including the provisions in Part XV concerning development on the foreshore into force. Some of these regulations require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and I propose to submit draft regulations within the next month. In addition to the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, development on the foreshore is subject to the requirements of the Foreshore Acts, 1933 to 1998, which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. I have no knowledge of the EIS referred to in the question.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for developing and disseminating publicity, advertisements and educational material on road safety is assigned to the National Safety Council (NSC). In accordance with the Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002, NSC have recently launched an education resource pack on safety including road safety, called &ldquo;BE SAFE&rdquo;, for use in primary schools. Over 30,000 copies of the pack have been distributed. A secondary school project on road safety is now also being developed by the NSC.</P>
      <P>NSC also promotes TV and other media and awareness campaigns on road safety on a continuing basis. Focusing these campaigns is a matter for the council having regard to the prioritisation by the Government strategy of the key areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing. In addition to major national campaigns, NSC also supports and encourages the organisation of projects and initiatives at local and community levels. A driver theory test service has just been launched and will commence testing in June 2001. The new theory test is designed to promote a more systematic understanding of road safety principles and behaviours, including the rules of the road, in novice drivers.</P>

      <P>The waste management plan for the Dublin region provides for the progressive extension throughout the region of separate collection services for organic and dry recyclable materials. Ultimately, it is intended <Col N="344" /> that this service will be available to some 80% of households in the region, and it will be supplemented by an extension of the current network of &lsquo;bring' facilities for recyclable materials.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the Government's policy statement &ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo;, local authorities should move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for the waste services which they provide, by means of use-related waste charges levied on all waste producers, including households and commercial or business concerns. Currently, Fingal County Council is one of only two county councils which do not levy household waste charges. The introduction of such charges would facilitate the roll-out of improved waste services throughout the County.</P>

      <P>The Finance Act, 2001, provides for a <Col N="345" /> new scheme of capital allowance for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances are effectively back dated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date. The actual cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum in line with the new write-off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery. The write-off will only be allowed against the trading income of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis, then the cost can be written off against both the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question. It is not proposed to provide for mitigation measures in relation to the introduction of the new taxi licensing regime beyond these provisions and the scheme of refunds by certain local authorities which has also been introduced in relation to licence fees charged at above the default level fixed in the Public Service Vehicle Regulations, 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 431, 432 and 433 together.</P>
      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of its rented dwellings is the responsibility of the local authority concerned, in this case Macroom Urban District Council. Special funding is available under the remedial works scheme (RWS) operated by my Department, to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to certain groups of their rented dwellings which they cannot fund from their own resources. Under the terms of the RWS, works to purchased dwellings, which would otherwise be the responsibility of the owner, may be included in a project where the local authority considers such works necessary to avoid an unacceptable or incongruous result to the refurbishment of the estate as a whole. In such cases, my Department will fund 50% of the cost of eligible works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Macroom Urban District Council's proposals for refurbishment works to this estate, at an esti<Col N="349" /> mated cost of £200,000, were approved in principle under the RWS by my Department in March, 1999. As these proposals included certain works to purchased houses the local authority was informed that, in accordance with the terms of the RWS, my Department will fund 50% of the cost of eligible works in these cases. The terms of the RWS do not provide for the waiving of this condition.</P>
    <P>A capital allocation to fund eligible works in this estate in 2001 will be notified to Macroom UDC shortly in the context of the overall financial allocations to local authorities under the RWS this year. Under the terms of pre &ndash; 1988 tenant purchase schemes, local authorities were required to ensure that houses sold by them were in good structural condition or, alternatively, to recoup to the purchaser the cost of works necessary to put a house in good structural condition. Under the terms of tenant purchase schemes from 1988 to date, houses are required to be sold at open market value based on their existing state of repair and condition. In either case, where such houses come within the scope of a RWS, my Department's contribution to the cost of eligible works is 50%.</P>
    <P>Dwellings constructed by local authorities do not come within the scope of HOMEBOND, formerly known as the national house building guarantee scheme. In the circumstances the question of recoupment under this scheme does not arise.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the Housing Act, 1988, defines the circumstances in which a person shall be regarded by a local housing authority as being homeless. Section 10 enables a local authority to respond to homelessness in a number of ways, including by directly arranging and funding emergency accommodation, making arrangements with a health board or voluntary body for the provision of emergency accommodation, and/or making contributions to voluntary bodies towards the running costs of accommodation provided by them. Generally, if a person presents as homeless to a local authority, he or she will be provided with emergency accommodation, whether hostel or bed and breakfast, while the local authority establishes that the person is, in fact, homeless. Efforts are then made to obtain more suitable long-term accommodation.</P>
      <P>Section 10 provides that where accommodation is being made available to a homeless person, the local authority may, at any time, specify a period for which the accommodation is being made available. However, accommodation is generally available to homeless persons for as long as the local authority deems that they are in need of such accommodation. My Department recoups 90% of expenditure by local authorities on the provision of accommodation for homeless persons under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>

      <P>The following tabular statements show the number of halting site bays provided or pro<Col N="352" /> posed by local authorities. Table 1 shows the number of permanent halting site bays provided for Travellers by local authorities for the period 1996 to 2000. Table 2 shows the number of new bays local authorities propose to develop under their five year local Traveller accommodation programmes which cover the years 2000-04. The programmes do not give a breakdown of the proposed provision in each year. Implementation of the programmes will radically alter the situation in relation to Traveller accommodation nationally.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a carer's allowance on 22 August 2000. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied. This application was refused as the full-time care and attention condition was not satisfied. She appealed the decision and, following an oral hearing, the appeals officer disallowed the appeal. She was notified of the outcome of her appeal on 4 April 2001. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of the fuel allowance is that the claimant and members of his/her household must not have a combined income of more than £30 per week above the maximum rate of old age contributory pension appropriate to the household. The person concerned applied for a fuel allowance in September 2000 and again in February 2001. On each occasion, her application was disallowed as her income, derived from her British widow's pension, exceeded the maximum limit for receipt of the allowance, at that time, £126.00 per week. From 6 April 2001, as part of budget 2000 improvements, the maximum weekly personal rate of old age contributory pension was increased to £106.00, raising the income limit for fuel allowance in this case to £136.00. Arising from this, the person concerned now qualifies for the fuel allowance with effect from 6 April 2001. A cheque for £15 in respect of the final three week period of the 2000-01 heating season will issue to her shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year 5,883 students participated in the students summer job scheme. Participation levels have been dropping over the past few years due, no doubt, to the wider availability of well paid summer jobs. This year, it is estimated, based on the trends over the past few years, that some 4,750 students will participate in the scheme. The scheme is targeted at students from low income families who are participating in third level courses and who, under existing legislation, cannot apply for unemployment assistance during the summer months.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to the means test applied to unemployment assistance payments and in that way the financial circumstances of the student's family are taken into account when assessing eligibility. To make the scheme available to all third level students would contravene the primary aim of the scheme which is to help those students who need it most. This year, in order to give extra help to less well off students, I have decided that an additional £1 per hour will be paid to those students whose parents are dependent on social welfare payments. This will allow them to earn an extra £200 if they work the maximum number of hours allowed under the scheme giving them a total payment of £800 for 200 hours work.</P>
      <P>In addition, and in recognition of the special difficulties such students may experience when looking for summer work, I have decided that approved students who are in receipt of disability allowance or blind persons pension will be eligible to participate in the scheme this year. There are no plans to increase the £3 per hour payment under this year's scheme. It would be inadvisable to do this in a tightening labour market. The scheme does not fall within the scope of the national minimum wage legislation and, therefore, the minimum wage provisions do not apply.</P>

      <P>My Department has, for a number of years, operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs. The 2001 scheme of grants was advertised extensively in the national and provincial newspapers earlier this year. The western regional office of my Department received an application for funding, under the scheme of supports for community development and family support groups, from the group indicated in the Deputy's question. As a large number of applications have been received and will take time to process, it is not possible to indicate at this stage if funding can be allocated to the group under this year's scheme. My Department will be in touch with the group in due course regarding its application.</P>

      <P>One of the commitments made prior to the 1997 general election was to address the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension, including self-employed people who were already over 56 years in 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group. These could not qualify for a pension because they could not satisfy the basic conditions required for pension purposes, particularly the requirement to have entered insurance ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>A special old age contributory pension was introduced in April 1999 for self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have at least five years' contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>
      <P>The special arrangement introduced in April 1999 represents a positive and reasonable response to the situation in which this particular group of people found themselves and there are no plans at present to make further changes.</P>

      <P>The foundation for investing in communities was established in November 1998 as a joint venture between Government and the major employer bodies to provide additional support, through finance and resources, to communities experiencing social exclusion and poverty. The foundation is an independent body with its own board of directors, including a representative from my Department.</P>
      <P>The main aims of the foundation are as follows: support for voluntary-community based projects on the basis of providing additional, rather than duplicating or replacing, existing State funding; the continued development of local enterprise networks under the auspices of &ldquo;business in the Community&rdquo;; and seeking new ways of addressing the needs of disadvantaged children, including supporting research into the root causes of disadvantage among children, and distributing funds to voluntary and community organisations involved in the welfare of children.</P>
      <P>Funding totalling £1.05 million was provided by my Department to the foundation &ndash; £750,000 in the 1998 and £300,000 in the 1999 budget. This funding was provided as a &ldquo;challenge grant&rdquo; to help meet the establishment and set-up costs of the foundation and to form part of the foundation's funding base to be spent in achievement of its objectives.</P>
      <P>One of the main functions of the foundation is to build up an endowment fund, through corporate and private donations and bequests, from which, overtime, funds will be distributed to voluntary and community groups-projects. An endowment fund has been established and £400,000 from by Department's allocation of £1.05 million has been put on endowment. A challenge facing the foundation is to seek funds for this endowment fund from potential donors in the wider business community, wealthy individuals, bequests etc.</P>
      <P>The work of the foundation of investing in communities is carried out by three separate companies, Business in the Community, the Community Foundation for Ireland and the National Children's Trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Business in the Community, which now has 20 founding members, assists companies in setting up specific programmes or in participating in established programmes. Some of the programmes operated by BITC include: BITC is currently working with several major companies on the development of in-house employer supported volunteering policies to support employee already involved in volunteering and to encourage those not yet involved; the linkage programme is a joint programme between the probation and welfare service and BITC which creates work experience and job placement opportunities for ex-offenders; and through the stay in school initiative, BITC offers companies <Col N="358" /> the opportunity to become involved in a local school and assists with developing programmes and initiatives between the company and the school.</P>
    <P>The aims of the Community Foundation for Ireland are to raise, manage and distribute funds for charitable purposes and to build a permanent civic endowment fund to serve the Irish community. I understand from the foundation that since its establishment in November 1998, 270,000 in grants have been allocated to 33 different local groups.</P>
    <P>The National Children's Trust, which is chaired by Mr. Tom Mitchell, former Provost of Trinity College Dublin, was established to seek new ways of addressing the needs of disadvantaged children, including supporting research into the root causes of disadvantage among children, and distributing funds to voluntary and community organisations involved in the welfare of children.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to relocate the Social Welfare inspectors who are currently based at Sundrive Road, Crumlin, to a new local office and regional headquarters, now under construction at a site between Bishop Street and Kevin Street. This new local office will amalgamate existing local offices at Werburgh Street and Victoria Street. The development is due for completion later this year.</P>
      <P>The new office will provide modern facilities for customers and staff with improved comfort and privacy and will be fully accessible for people with disabilities. The Crumlin office is essentially for the accommodation of inspectors and interviews with customers which could not be carried out there in any event. The office has no access for people with disabilities, nor would it be feasible to provide them, having regard to the characteristics of the site. Elderly people and parents with small children have had difficulty with the stairway. The new office, which will accommodate the full range of local office services and inspections, will be a considerable improvement for customers in the areas concerned. Information on social welfare services will continue to be available to citizens at a community information centre, which is funded by my Department and which is next door to the Sundrive Road office.</P>

      <P>Where a parent is receiving a pension or other long-term payment from my Department, child dependent allowances &ndash; CDAs &ndash; are payable up to the age of 22 years or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday, where the young person remains in full-time education. In the case of short-term payments, CDAs are only paid up to the age of 18. The Government is committed to extending CDAs to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 and in full-time education in the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In regard to the community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; scheme and CDAs, the position is that CDAs are paid to CE employees who were, prior to commencing the scheme, in receipt of a social welfare payment which included such allowances. I emphasise that the question of payments under the CE scheme, including CDAs, is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has overall policy responsibility for the scheme.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability. The policy direction over the past number of years has been to concentrate resources on improving child benefit for all families. Before we came to office, expenditure on child benefit was £397 million annually. Our first three budgets increased this to £575 million, an increase of more than 40%. The child benefit increases provided in the budget for 2001 constitute a full-year investment of £330 million. This is the first of three years of increases which will see investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003. Further enhancements to the child benefit scheme along the lines proposed by the Deputy would be extremely costly and would have to be considered in a budgetary context in light of available resources and other competing priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council in Lisbon (March 2000) set itself a new strategic goal for the next decade &ldquo;to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.&rdquo; The achievement of that goal requires an integrated policy approach in the economic, employment and social areas. The European Council considered that in the social area this will involve &ldquo; modernising the European social model, investing in people and combating social exclusion&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the European social model, with its developed systems of social protection must underpin the transformation to the knowledge economy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The European Council recognised in this context that social protection systems need to be adapted as part of an active welfare state: (a) to ensure that work pays (b) to secure their long-term sustainability in the face of an ageing population, (c) to promote social inclusion and gender equality, and (d) to provide quality health services. Responsibility for meeting these objectives remains at national level. However, the challenge of meeting them can be better addressed as part of a co-operative effort between member states with the support of the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The European Council, therefore, invited the Council to strengthen co-operation between member states by exchanging experiences and best practice on the basis of improved information networks which are the basic tools in this field. A social protection committee composed of representatives of all the member states and the Commission has been established to co-ordinate the co-operative process and to report regularly on the process to the Council of Ministers. It is also working in this regard with the EU committees on economic policy and employment in developing an integrated approach to achieving the Lisbon strategic goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To strengthen this process in the social protection policy area and ensure that it has equal status with employment and economic policy, Ireland proposed two amendments to the treaty at the recent Inter-Governmental Conference. The first specifically provides that the &ldquo;modernisation of social protection systems&rdquo;, together with &ldquo;the combating of social exclusion&rdquo;&ndash; based on previous amendment proposed by Ireland &ndash; would be the focus for ongoing co-operation among member states. The second amendment provides a clear basis in the treaty for the social protection <Col N="361" /> committee, thus guaranteeing its continuing role in co-ordinating social protection policy at EU level on an equal basis with the committees on employment and economic policy. Both amendments have been incorporated in the Treaty of Nice.</P>
    <P>Much progress in developing co-operation has been achieved since the European Council in Lisbon, apart from the treaty amendments and establishment of the social protection committee. Two priorities were also set at Lisbon in the social protection field. Under the modernisation of social protection heading, it was agreed to commission a study on the sustainability of pensions, which is of major concern to all Member states as a result of the ageing of the population. A framework for national reports on member states' strategies on pensions was agreed and the reports by member states were submitted to the Commission in February. A synthesis report is being compiled by the social protection committee for submission to the European Council in Gothenburg in June.</P>
    <P>The European Council also agreed that policies for combating social exclusion should be based on an open method of co-ordination. This should include national action plans to promote social inclusion and a Commission initiative for co-operation in the field. A set of objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion was also agreed and these will provide a framework for the national action plans due to be submitted to the Commission by 1 June. The Commission organised seminars for Government officials, representatives of the social partners and the NGOs in all the member states to present and discuss the national action plan requirements. The Irish seminar, on 28 March, afforded an excellent opportunity for a detailed exchange of views on the preparation of the national action plan for Ireland and on what it should contain. Currently, preparations are fully on course for completion of the plan and its submission to the Commission by the 1 June deadline. Commission proposals for an action programme to support the process are currently being considered by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament with Ireland's full support.</P>
    <P>The contribution which systems of social protection can make &ldquo;to ensuring that work pays&rdquo; is scheduled to be examined by the social protection committee later this year. The committee has also established an <i>ad hoc</i> group to prepare reports on appropriate social indicators to assist in measuring progress in achieving the social protection and social inclusion goals, and in identifying best practice in this regard.</P>
    <P>There has already been major strides made in modernising our social protection systems, especially in the more active approaches to supports for the unemployed in terms of income support, education and training, job search and assisting with the transition back to employment, in the much improved supports for families in meeting their caring responsibilities, and in the <Col N="362" /> whole area of securing sustainable pensions and the care of the elderly. Ireland has a pioneering role in combating social exclusion through the national anti-poverty strategy. Given the progress achieved, Ireland has much to offer in the EU wide exchanges on social protection and social inclusion now getting under way.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, however, that we have also much to learn on these matters from the other member states, among whom are states with the most developed and progressive social protection systems in the world. I have ensured that my Department has been fully committed to the development of this co-operative process from the outset and I am equally determined that this will continue. I am also determined that full account will be taken of the various outcomes of the process in developing policies and programmes to modernise our systems of social protection and promote social inclusion in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set out the position on the issue of child benefit entitlements and multiple births on a number of occasions to this House in the recent past. Briefly, the position is that prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of 4 and 12.</P>
      <P>In fulfilment of our pre-election commitments, I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. Second, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include families with multiple births of three or more children. Both these measures took effect in September 1998, at a full year cost of some £4.8 million. The enhanced child benefit rates payable in the case of twins and other multiple births, give an appropriate level of recognition within the scheme of the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them, and fully implement the commitment made in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> The child benefit package provided in this year's budget will deliver significant gains to all families with children, including those with twins. Child benefit rates will increase by over 50% from June 2001, a full three months earlier than usual. This marks the first step in a three year programme of increases which will see Government investment in the payment rise by an additional £1 billion, by 2003. The question of providing any further enhancement of the arrangements for twins under the child benefit scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of the resources available and other competing priorities. The cost of providing for double child benefit payment for twins is estimated at some £10.2 million in a full year, based on the improved rates recently announced in the budget for 2001.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided, in principle, to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance to be operated by the local authorities. One of the objectives of the new scheme will be to ensure that a full range of housing options is available to people with long-term housing needs, including those on local authority waiting lists who are renting in the private rented sector. The Government has also taken a number of other initiatives to improve the supply of social and affordable housing. The priority, therefore, is to provide housing solutions rather than social welfare solutions to meet the housing needs of people on low to modest incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme has a different role to play. It is an income maintenance measure that provides a short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to lack of minimum resources. The SWA scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The conditions for receiving rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. Any <Col N="364" /> changes that are needed will be considered in the context of developments in social housing provision and in the wider housing area aimed at improving the housing position of people on low incomes.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. Neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement, nor how overpayments should be dealt with, in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. SWA is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent. The person concerned had been in receipt of rent supplement at the rate of £658.70 per month. Following a recent routine review of rent supplements by the local community welfare officer &ndash; CWO &ndash; it came to light <Col N="365" /> that the person has been working part time since early September 2000 and had not notified the health board of this fact, giving rise to an overpayment of rent supplement. The CWO contacted the person concerned and advised her that payment of her rent supplement would be suspended pending a revision of her means assessment to take account of her earnings from the part time job. The CWO has asked the person concerned to contact him so that he can advise her of the new rate of rent supplement to be paid and to discuss any action to be taken regarding the overpayment. As the CWO has not been contacted, he has written to the person in question setting out the position. As the Deputy will appreciate I cannot give any directive relating to an overpayment in a specific case as responsibility for operational matters of this nature rests with the health board concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Permanent and pensionable civil servants employed before April, 1995 are liable for PRSI class B contributions. This is a modified rate of PRSI, i.e. the combined employer and employee contribution rate is 4.91% as opposed to the standard class A contribution of either 12.5% or 18%, depending on the level of weekly income. In return, class B contributors are insured for a limited range of social insurance benefits &ndash; widow/er's and orphan's (contributory) pensions, bereavement grant and limited occupational injury benefits only. As their conditions of employment provide for full pay during the period of maternity leave, there is no need to cover such employees for maternity benefit purposes.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that the case that the Deputy has in mind involves a woman who has left the Civil Service to take up employment in the private sector and who claimed maternity benefit shortly afterwards. On leaving the Civil Service to take up other employment, for example, in the private sector or self-employment, a former class B contributor's employment rights may change considerably. For example, they may no longer be entitled to occupational sick pay or maternity pay and there may also be different occupational pension arrangements or, indeed, no occupational pension cover at all. In addition, such a person's PRSI status would change. For instance, they would become liable for the standard class A PRSI contribution if they took up employment in the private sector or PRSI class S contribution if they took up self-employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> Eligibility for benefits in this case would be determined in the same way as anyone else becoming insured for the first time at either class A or S. In order to qualify for short-term social insurance payments, a claimant must have paid a minimum number of contributions &ndash; 39 weeks &ndash; and demonstrate a recent attachment to the work force by having a minimum number of contributions in a recent tax year. More flexible conditions apply in the case of the maternity benefit scheme. For instance, a woman may also qualify if she has paid at least 39 contributions in the 12 months immediately before she commences her maternity leave.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current contribution conditions applying to the maternity benefit scheme are reasonable and strike a fair balance between the interests of the average contributor and those of the average beneficiary. In the case in question, the woman left the Civil Service last September and commenced her maternity leave at the end of March 2001. It does not appear that her new employer operates an occupational maternity pay scheme. As she does not satisfy the contribution conditions for entitlement she is not eligible for maternity benefit. In this case, she has failed to qualify for maternity benefit, not by virtue of her class B contributions, which do not provide cover for maternity benefit, but because she has not paid a sufficient number of qualifying class A contributions. My Department does not maintain separate statistics on this type of case. However, it is understood that it would be a rare occurrence. She is, however, currently receiving supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

Following a further request by the person concerned to have her application in respect of her mother reviewed, she was invited to submit further medical evidence in support of her claim. This information was received on 25 April 2001 and will be considered by the Department's assessor. The entitlement of <Col N="367" /> the person concerned will then be reviewed and she will be notified directly of the outcome. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 457 and 458 together.</P>
      <P>Claims under the one-parent family payment scheme and the free schemes are processed from my Departments office in Sligo which also administers all of the main pensions schemes for which the Department is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the one-parent family payments around 18,000 claims a year &ndash; equivalent to about 350 per week &ndash; are being received at present. Over the past 12 months, the average number of weeks to decide a claim was ten weeks in the case of unmarried claimants and 14 weeks in the case of separated claimants. This represents <Col N="368" /> a slight deterioration on the position in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>The time taken to process individual claims varies significantly having regard to the difficulty or otherwise in establishing the circumstances in each case. It should be noted however, that a large majority of applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payment will normally continue until entitlement to one-parent family payment is determined. Every effort is being made to process applications as quickly as possible and to minimise the time during which applicants receive these alternative forms of support.</P>
    <P>It is intended to devolve the administration of the one-parent family payment to the Department's network of local offices around the country. This will assist in reducing claim processing times, through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network. Plans for localisation of the scheme are being drawn up at present and a localisation pilot project is currently getting under way.</P>
    <P>The scope of the free schemes has been greatly extended din the last tow budgets. It is expected that an additional 80,000 claims will be processed this year, al most doubling the normal annual new claim intake.</P>
    <P>An increase of this order in the level of new claims inevitably impacts to some degree on the normal claims turnaround. Additional staff and overtime resources have been applied by the Department to deal with the extra work volumes in 2000 and further resources are being assigned to deal with the extra claim intake in 2001.</P>
    <P>In the normal course, my Department would expect to process 70% of claims to the schemes in question in seven weeks. With the assignment of additional staff, normal response rates will be restored over the next few months. I would like to assure the Deputy, however, that every effort is made to process all claims as quickly as possible and that any delay will not result in any loss of entitlements to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Overall staffing requirements in the Sligo office are being reviewed at present in the context of an overall review of requirements in the Department generally.</P>

The office will continue to house local office staff who deal with unemployment claims and provide an information service on the full range of social welfare schemes; investigative staff who <Col N="369" /> investigate customer's entitlements to various social welfare schemes, and employment support staff who provide advice and support on employment and training opportunities. The building also houses the Dublin North regional management team and the area management for the greater Finglas and Ballymun areas. The premises will continue to provide facilities for regional staff training, meetings and conferences. A pilot enhanced information and support service for families is also being developed at the office. In addition to the foregoing, the Office of Public Works, who owns the building, is examining the possibility of relocating a small number of other staff to this location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Permanent and pensionable civil servants employed before April 1995 are liable for PRSI class B contributions. This is a modified rate of PRSI, i.e. the combined employer and employee contribution rate is 4.91% as opposed to the standard class A contribution of either 12.5% or 18%, depending on the level of weekly income. In return, class B con<Col N="370" /> tributors are insured for a limited range of social insurance benefits &ndash; widow/er's and orphan's (contributory) pensions, bereavement grant and limited occupational injury benefits only. Due to their conditions of employment, there is no need to cover such employees for other social insurance benefits such as disability, maternity and unemployment benefits and old age (contributory) and retirement pensions. On leaving the Civil Service to take up other employment, e.g. in the private sector or self-employment, a former class B contributor's employment rights may change considerably. For instance, they may no longer be entitled to occupational sick pay or maternity pay and there may also be different occupational pension arrangements or indeed no occupational pension cover at all. In addition, such a person's PRSI status would change. For instance they would become liable for the standard class A PRSI contribution if they took up employment in the private sector or PRSI class S contribution if they took up self-employment. Eligibility for benefits in this case would be determined in the same way as anyone else becoming insured for the first time at either class A or S. In order to qualify for short-term social insurance payments, a claimant must have paid a minimum number of contributions (39 weeks) and demonstrate a recent attachment to the work force by having a minimum number of contributions in a recent tax year. More flexible conditions apply in the case of the maternity benefit scheme. For instance, a woman may also qualify if she has paid at least 39 contributions in the 12 months immediately before she commences her maternity leave. I am satisfied that the current contribution conditions applying to the maternity benefit scheme are reasonable and strike a fair balance between the interests of the average contributor and those of the average beneficiary.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, the woman left the Civil Service last September and commenced her maternity leave at the end of March, 2001. It does not appear that her new employer operates an occupational maternity pay scheme. As she does not satisfy the contribution conditions for entitlement, she is not eligible for maternity benefit. In this case, she has failed to qualify for maternity benefit, not by virtue of her class B contributions which do not provide cover for maternity benefit, but because she has not paid a sufficient number of qualifying class A contributions. She is, however, currently receiving supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my recent parliamentary reply, parliamentary Question No. 181, which outlined some of the developments on the Grand Canal, particularly in the Clondalkin and Lucan areas, since publication of the Grand Canal corridor study in 1995. Closer to the city, there have been a number of significant developments since 1997 including the provision of jetties and major tree planting works along the circular line. A number of boat tour operations have been licensed on the canal including the amphibious Viking Splash. Angling and water sport activities continue to gain in popularity. A joint project team has been set up with Dublin Corporation and Waterways Ireland to implement landscaping projects along the city canals. It is expected that a pilot scheme on the stretch between Portobello Bridge and Harold's Cross Bridge will be developed later this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Waterways Ireland, a North/South implementation body for inland waterways, was established on 2 December 1999, on foot of the British-Irish Agreement and was assigned the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of certain inland navigable waterways systems throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes. Accordingly, any future developments on the canal system will be a matter for Waterways Ireland under the North/South Ministerial Council.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the Irish Peatland Conservation Council's proposal for a bogs and fens conservation plan which, I understand, is not as yet a completed document. The work of the IPCC is well known to me and I am pleased that my Department has been associated with their initiatives in the past, especially in relation to acquisition of bog habitat.</P>
      <P>The proposed plan will certainly be fully considered within my Department and I hope that it will prove useful in informing policy development. However, I cannot at this stage give any undertaking to implement any particular proposals that I have not yet seen. It is not possible for my Department to fund studies on plans such as this other than where the Department directly commissions such studies.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to my replies to recent questions in regard to these matters, Parliamentary Questions Nos. 37 and 69 of 11 Aibreán 2001.</P>
      <P>I have no immediate proposals to add to the existing list of 362 candidate SACs. Having regard to the number and extent of candidate SACS that I have now proposed, I anticipate that Ireland's proposals will be found sufficient for most habitats and species at the second Atlantic region seminar. Only then will it become clear whether Ireland should propose more sites for particular habitats or species, in order to contribute to the Natura 2000 Network in proportion to the contributions of other member states.</P>
      <P>The main preparation my Department is making for the second Atlantic Region Biogeographical Seminar, planned for September 2001, is to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the EU Commission and its advisers so that our proposals can be properly evaluated.</P>

      <P>As I have pointed out in previous statements, I am concerned that the number of whales killed outside the control of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has been increasing steadily right through the 1990s. Pressure is increasing in IWC to finalise a revised management scheme and to allow a resumption of whaling. Pressure is also being exerted at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species &ndash; CITES &ndash; to allow international trade in whale species. In those circumstances I put forward proposals to: (1) limit whaling to coastal zones; (2) limit whaling to whaling for domestic use only; and (3) phase out scientific whaling.</P>
      <P>These proposals will bring about a reduction in the number of whales being killed and unless these conditions are accepted I will not consider proposals to put an end to the moratorium on commercial whaling.</P>
      <P>A scientific evaluation of whole population is already being undertaken by the scientific committee of IWC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The magpie, <i>pica pica</i>, is widely distributed around Ireland and there are an estimated 320,000 breeding pairs in the country. All wild birds, including the magpie, are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended, and the EU Birds Directive 79/409 EEC. There are no figures available to show that there has been an increase in magpie numbers although the bird has been successful in adapting to urban life.</P>
      <P>While there is a widely held perception that the magpie is a danger to other bird species, in particular songbirds, this is not supported by scientific evidence. The magpie is a predator like a number of bird species, e.g. the sparrowhawk, and will eat the eggs and the young of other birds but scientific advice is that this presents no significant threat to the conservation status of other bird species. There are no estimates available for the impact, if any, by magpie predation on other birds. However, a study in England concluded that an analysis of the trends in magpie numbers and in the numbers and breeding success for 11 species of songbird, provided no evidence that magpies had any effect on songbirds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A derogation has been negotiated from the EU Birds Directive 79/409 EEC to enable control <Col N="379" /> measures to be taken by landowners and their agents against the magpie and a number of other species. Where the magpie presents a threat to public health and is a vector in the spread of animal diseases, where it is a threat to livestock or would cause serious damage to fauna, notably the nests and young of game birds, magpies may be controlled by <i>inter alia</i> shooting or trapping. However, based on the scientific evidence available to me that the magpie does not pose a significant threat to other bird populations, I have no plans to extend the control measures which are currently in place.</P>

      <P>The American bullfrog, <i>rana catesbiana</i>, is a native of North America and was subsequently introduced into the Carribean and then Europe. It is comparatively large in size growing to between 3.5 and eight inches. The species is both aggressive and carnivorous, feeding on anything it can swallow including insects, crayfish, small fish, other frogs and also birds and snakes. I am advised that the species poses an ecological threat to native species in both France and Italy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International and domestic legislation governs the importation of <i>rana catesbiana</i>. The European Commission has recognised the threat of <i>rana catesbiana</i> to European species by including it on annex B of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2724/2000 on the protection of species of wild flora and fauna, whereby it may not be imported from outside the EU into any EU country including Ireland without prior issue of a permit. Currently, a further control is provided under the Wildlife Act, 1976 &ndash; SI 296 of 1989 (Control of Importation of Wild Animals and Wild Birds), Regulations, 1989 &ndash; which prohibit the importation into Ireland of live wild animals or their eggs or spawn including <i>rana catesbiana</i> save under licence. It is an offence under the Wildlife Act, 1976, to breach these regulations and the Act provides for fines of £50 for a first offence rising to £200 in the case of a third or subsequent offence. However, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, provides for substantially increased penalties on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for 12 months or to both. On conviction on indictment a fine <Col N="380" /> not exceeding £50,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both, may be imposed. The Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000 also provides that any person who wilfully turns loose or causes to escape any species of wild animal except under licence from me as Minister shall also be guilty of an offence. I have also specific powers under both the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended, and the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, to specifically prohibit the importation or introduction of non-native species which may be detrimental to native species.</P>
    <P>I understand that the European Commission is considering the commissioning of research into addressing the issue of <i>rana catesbiana</i> already present in the EU. In relation to Ireland I am not aware that <i>rana catesbiana</i> is present in the wild in this country. However, I am advised that its illegal introduction would present only a limited threat to native species as the bullfrog would find it difficult to establish itself in the wild in Ireland because climatic conditions do not favour its breeding here. Any reports of illegal importation should be made to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department where they will be investigated.</P>

      <P>Mouds Bog is a raised bog situated 3 km north of Newbridge, County Kildare, and is currently proposed for designation as a natural heritage area under the Wildlife Acts, 1976 to 2000. The site has not been proposed for designation as a special area of conservation under the European Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; EPA &ndash; requested Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, to comment on an application for a pollution control licence received by the EPA from a commercial peat extraction company who wished to harvest from the site. On 16 March 2001, my Department responded to the effect that the extraction of 50 hectares of peat from this site would not be compatible with the conservation of the bog and recommended to the EPA that the licence should be refused. The decision is solely a matter for the EPA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first point out <Col N="383" /> that my Department has no function with regard to records of births, marriages and deaths held by the General Register Office, which are normally regarded as the primary genealogical source records. These records fall within the remit of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Within the remit of my Department there are records and other material useful to genealogical researchers in the National Library and the National Archives. In the case of the National Library, the material is readily available to readers at the Library's reading rooms. The Library has been endeavouring to expand the range of records and materials available for research purposes and has included useful guidance on the subject on its website: www.nli.ie. A separate genealogy service is available to personal callers to the Library giving them an opportunity to discuss their family history research with a professional genealogist or experienced staff member.</P>
      <P>In the case of the National Archives, the records used most heavily by genealogists include copies of the Census returns of 1901 and 1911, the Tithe Applotment Books and valuation records of the 19th century, and copies of wills dating from the 17th to 19th centuries. Access to the records is relatively easy for members of the public visiting Dublin as the National Archives reading room is open from 10.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m., Monday to Friday.</P>
      <P>Most of the more important genealogical sources held in the National Archives, including the Census returns of 1901 and 1911, are now available on microfilm. Duplicates of these microfilms are available for purchase by county libraries, county genealogical centres and other institutions in order to facilitate access to the records by researchers who are based outside Dublin or are not in a position to visit the National Archives. Most of the microfilms are also available to researchers living overseas through the genealogical libraries of the Genealogical Society of Utah.</P>
      <P>The website of the National Archives, www.nationalarchives.ie, already includes a considerable amount of information of interest to genealogists. The National Archives is investigating the feasibility of adding copies of some of the most frequently used records to the website, but this will probably take several years to achieve. An Index to Wills in the National Archives was published by Eneclann on CD-ROM in 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 491, 492, 495, 500, 505, 514, 521, 522, 523, 524, 540 and 542 together.</P>
      <P>I have spoken in the House on many occasions on the subject of missing persons. As I have indicated before, the deployment of Garda resources and the investigative methods used in missing persons cases are matters for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána does all in its power to locate all missing persons and that they do provide considerable support for families.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities assure me that the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases are continually reviewed. As a result of this, substantial changes were made in 1998 such as the introduction of new guidelines and procedures which place a particular emphasis on keeping the families of missing persons informed by a liaison officer who deals with a designated family member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know from the Garda statistics that approximately 99% of those reported missing in any year are accounted for by the end of the year. We must realise that not all of the people who go <Col N="386" /> missing do so in suspicious circumstances, which would be of interest to the Garda. While An Garda Síochána has a website which gives details of certain missing persons, I do not consider it appropriate that either the Garda or my Department would run a help line specifically for this purpose but I would emphasise that the Garda do maintain close liaison with the families of missing persons.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of persons who were untraced at the end of each year, from 1990 to 1999, the last year for which published figures are available, is as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Garda Síochána/Crime.</i>Under the National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006, the Government has allocated approximately £6 million for the BMW region to finance an increase in the number of Garda youth diversion projects, of which approximately £0.75 million has been allocated for the current year. The projects, which are overseen by my Department in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, are a crime prevention measure which aim, through both intervention and prevention, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal activity.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, to date, a total of nine projects have been established in the BMW region under the terms of the national development plan, and there are a number of proposals before my Department at present for the establishment of further projects in the region. Approximately £0.56 million was allocated to facilitate this expansion in the number of projects for the region during the year 2000.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Prisons</i>Expenditure by the prisons service under the NDP in the BMW region during 2000 was nil. The planned expenditure for 2001 in the BMW region is £2.16 million. The prisons at which relevant expenditure will arise are Castlerea Prison and Midlands Prison.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides funding for a number of probation and welfare service programmes. In 2000, £74,990 was spent in the BMW region largely on &lsquo;buying in' 30 day residential treatment for offenders involved in substance abuse &ndash; alcohol and drugs &ndash; and on employing extra community support workers to facilitate employment and training opportunities for offenders on supervision, including ex-prisoners.</P>
      <P>Planned expenditure for the BMW region in 2001, totals £347,755. As well as expansion in the 30 day treatment programmes and employing additional support workers, just over £200,000 has been allocated to programmes for sex offenders and drug rehabilitation work with offenders in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Equality</i>The activities of the equality division of my <Col N="388" /> Department impact on both the Border, midland and western and south and east regions. The equality for women measure, however has a specific budget of IR£6.1 million in the BMW regional operational programme for the period 2000-06. This funding will be used to develop initiatives in the following areas: up skilling and retraining of women; encouraging entrepreneurship and career development among women; innovative projects for disadvantaged women and women over 50 years of age; support women in decision making; gender proofing of personnel practices; family friendly arrangements in employment and sharing of family responsibilities; a research and information campaign for return to work women.</P>
    <P>My Department is responsible for the full measure and will directly deliver the first four strands with the aid of technical support. The family friendly strand will be delivered by a national famework committee established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to support the development of family friendly policies at the level of the enterprise. The Equality Authority is delivering the gender proofing of personnel policies on behalf of my Department. In addition, a number of research projects are being funded under the measure.</P>
    <P>I formally launched the measure on 5 October 2000 and invited project applications for the first four strands. The announcement, which was carried in all the national and provincial papers, signalled a budget of £1.6 million for the BMW region for the period 2000-03. Approximately 126 applications were submitted from the BMW region by the closing date of 5 January 2001. A further 26 national applications were also received which would also impact on the BMW region. These project applications are now being assessed. A project selection committee has been formed to assist with this task. This committee will submit a report in mid-May and I expect to announce a list of project proposals which qualify for funding shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>This is a new measure. The framework of implementing the measure was developed in 2000. Expenditure of IR£9,000 was incurred in 2000 on advertising and publicity costs in the BMW region. The planned expenditure in 2001 is £1.31 million. No additional funding has been provided in the measure for the BMW region.</P>
    <P>Details of the projects selected for funding under the measure, together with anticipated outcomes, will be reported to the monitoring committee for the BMW regional assembly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child care</i>My Department's equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 operates under the national development plan on a national and regional basis. The programme has allocated funding under three sub-measures: capital, staffing and quality improvement.</P>
    <P>From 19 July 2000, when the first tranche of grants were announced, to 31 December 2000 my <Col N="389" /> Department allocated £6.01 million to the Border, midland and western region.</P>
    <P>To date in 2001, my Department has allocated £4.7 million to the Border midland and western region.</P>
    <P>In terms of funding under the quality improvement sub-measure, it should be noted that some quality improvement grants will have a national impact. For recording purposes the actual expenditure will be recorded in the region where funding is drawn down. These quality improvement grants are not reflected in the totals above.</P>

    <P>A large number of persons fall out of the asylum process for various reasons including those applicants who, on refusal of status, leave the jurisdiction. Approximately 4,000 persons dropped out of the direct provision arrangements in the last year. It is reasonable to conclude that many of these left the jurisdiction also. In addition, a significant proportion of the persons refused status would have been granted permission to remain on other grounds, for example, on the basis of parentage of Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The figure in relation to the number refused status includes approximately 850 cases which were deemed abandoned prior to the implementation in full of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, in November 2000 for various reasons, including where applicants did not respond to correspondence.</P>
    <P>In relation to deportations, 12 Nigerians of whom the Department is aware have returned home voluntarily, 186 have evaded deportation orders and 79 have been granted leave to seek judicial review of the Minister's decision to make a deportation order. One further Nigerian left the State before a deportation order could be enforced.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to sign, as soon as the necessary arrangements are in place, an agreement on immigration matters between Ireland and Nigeria, which was approved by the Government on 27 March 2001. This agreement provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a structured repatriation procedure for the readmission to the state of one contracting party of nationals of that state who are residing in the state of the other contracting party without authorisation.</P>

      <P>The agreement on immigration matters between Ireland and Nigeria, which was approved by the Government at its <Col N="392" /> meeting on 27 March 2001, and which it is my intention to sign as soon as the necessary arrangements are in place, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a structured repatriation procedure for the readmission to the state of one contracting party of nationals of that state who are residing in the state of the other contracting party without authorisation.</P>
      <P>The agreement sets out the basis on which the nationality of a person to be readmitted can be proved to the mutual satisfaction of the contracting parties and contains time limits within which responses to requests for readmission must be made and processed. The agreement also contains provisions relating to, <i>inter alia</i>, data protection, dispute resolution and sets out the basis on which the agreement will come into effect and can be terminated.</P>
      <P>The agreement also provides for the strengthening of co-operation between both states in the area of technical assistance on immigration and consular matters; the continuation of the State's significant programme of co-operation with Nigeria under the aegis of Ireland Aid focusing on basic needs and poverty reduction; and, within the limits of the existing resources, there is a commitment to consider enhancing this programme including in areas such as skills acquisition and training.</P>
      <P>The agreement also makes provision for the establishment of a high-level co-ordinating committee to oversee its implementation which will result in the enhancement of co-operation between both states in the area of legal immigration through, for example, the carrying out of an examination of ways in which increased opportunities for legal access to the Irish labour market can be developed.</P>
      <P>As this is an international agreement which will involve a charge upon public funds, its terms must, under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, be approved by Dáil Éireann in order for it to be binding on the State. Provision is made in the agreement that it will not come into force until Ireland and Nigeria notify each other of completion of domestic procedures required for its entry into force. The necessary resolution will be tabled in the Dáil by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applications for asylum in the State are processed in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, and, in particular, having due regard to the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in section 2 of that Act which is defined as &ldquo;a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear is unwilling to return to it&rdquo;. Section 1 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, defines &ldquo;membership of a particular <Col N="393" /> social group&rdquo; to include &ldquo;membership of a trade union and also includes membership of a group of persons whose defining characteristic is their belonging to the female or the male sex or having a particular sexual orientation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that following the full commencement of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999, and the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, on 20 November 2000, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications/appeals for refugee status. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.</P>
    <P>Decisions on asylum applications are made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform upon receipt of the recommendation/ decision of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate, on whether such status should be granted.</P>

Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and my Department. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting, etc.</P>
      <P>I announced last November that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, with £4 million being allocated in 2001. An application for a Garda CCTV system in Carlow is being considered in the context of this programme.</P>

      <P>Non-EEA nationals &ndash; the EEA is comprised of the member states of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland &ndash; who intend to reside in the State for longer than three months are required to register with the Garda registration office for the area in which they intend to reside. In the case of a person residing in Clonmel, the appropriate registration office is located at the superintendent's office, Clonmel Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immigration registration office, Harcourt Square, deals with the registration of persons living in the Dublin area only. It is the case that this office has experienced unprecedented growth in demand for its services in recent years and that this has led to delays for persons seeking to register or renew their permission to remain. The number of persons registered at the immigration registration office reflects the increase in migration to the State generally and has grown <Col N="397" /> from 12,803 in 1998 to 26,641 in 2000 &ndash; an increase of 108% in two years.</P>
    <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau, which was established following Government decision of 9 May 2000, has as one of its key responsibilities the co-ordination of registration services throughout the State. Since its establishment it has made significant progress in improving the quality of the service provided at the immigration registration office. The number of civilian staff has been more than doubled from ten to 24 and the opening hours have been extended so that the office is now open from 8. a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday to Thursday inclusive, and from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday. Temporary additional accommodation has also been made available.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department, in consultation with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, has introduced a number of measures which are designed to streamline the operation of the registration system. Certain categories of non-EEA nationals will no longer be required to register as often as heretofore thereby reducing the numbers who are likely to attend on any given day.</P>
    <P>My Department is also in consultation with the Office of Public Works with a view to securing a new and far larger building which would enable more persons to be dealt with at any given time and improve the quality of service generally. It is hoped to have this accommodation in place by the end of this year. Furthermore, the Garda authorities are in the process of seeking tenders for the provision of an IT system to make the registration service more efficient.</P>
    <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau has my full support in its efforts in this regard and I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in respect of future needs arising in relation to all aspects of the bureau's work.</P>

      <P>As of 31 March 2001, there were 959 civilians serving in the Garda Síochána mainly in clerical-administrative and professional posts. In general, civilian staff are employed in Garda stations and offices throughout the country, including the Garda College in Templemore and Garda headquarters in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Under the Garda SMI programme a report on civilianisation in the Garda Síochána has recommended the civilianisation of a further 556 posts currently held by gardaí in administrative and technical areas. This will release 556 gardaí to operational policing to tackle and prevent crime.</P>
      <P>The report on civilianisation represents a true partnership approach to the future of the Garda organisation. All Garda representative bodies engaged constructively in its development and agreed to the implementation plan as outlined in the report. Contrary to recent press reports, there has been no agreement to reduce the 556 posts to be civilianised.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that civilianisation of the 556 posts identified should take place over time. This is to allow for continuity of skills and takes account of those gardaí, particularly in technical areas, who would not be suited to transfer to other duties. The report envisages that 174 posts will be civilianised in the short-term, that is, one to three years.</P>
      <P>The civilianisation report states that the additional cost of employing a member of garda rank at a clerical function, as opposed to a clerical officer, is almost £12,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>The civilianisation report was recently endorsed by the Garda SMI steering group and I will be presenting it to Government shortly. Implementation of the recommendations will commence when the report has been approved by Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 517 and 544 together.</P>
      <P>General legislative proposals to amend the civil law of defamation are being advanced as part of the Government's legislation programme. The heads of a defamation Bill have yet to be approved by Government and it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt Government consideration of the matter by indicating at this time the precise matters which are under consideration for inclusion in the Bill. It would, however, be true to say that certain of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to this area of the law would, if implemented, provide plaintiffs in defamation actions with methods of redress which have the potential to be cheaper than traditional court actions in which damages are sought.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of a supervisory body for the media, it should be recalled that the Commission on the Newspaper Industry recommended that an ombudsman be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry itself. I understand that my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has indicated in replies to parliamentary questions in the past that she agrees with that recommendation.

      <P>A detailed response was forwarded to the Department by the Garda authorities on 21 February 2001 and received shortly thereafter. A reply to the Deputy was then prepared in the relevant section and subsequently forwarded to my office for issue.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Deputy's concerns, I ask him to appreciate that the issues raised by him required the Department to request a report from the Garda authorities. Many other letters of this type are received and reports must be sought from the Garda authorities. Such letters are dealt with as expeditiously as possible but, given the nature of the correspondence, frequently requiring reports from gardaí engaged in operational duties, and the aforementioned volume of correspondence, delays of the type encountered by the Deputy cannot always be avoided.</P>

      <P>In my response to Question No. 434 on 24 October 2000, I informed the Deputy that the average processing time was approximately two and a half years. Since that time, extra resources have been allocated to the citizenship area of my Department and the processing time has been reduced to approximately two years. I expect that this will be reduced further, as the year progresses, and it is likely that the application of the person referred to will be finalised by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Lisbon Summit 2000, the Heads of State or Government set a vision for the EU to become by 2010 the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in <Col N="402" /> the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. The broadly based Lisbon strategy includes the objectives of furthering equal opportunities and the promotion of social inclusion. While my Department is not a lead Department in relation to the Lisbon agenda, it is fully committed, including through supporting the work of other Departments, to playing its part in meeting the Lisbon objectives both through its participation and contribution in equality initiatives being developed at EU level and through national policy development. For example, my Department is participating in the EU e-accessibility expert group set up under the high level group on the employment and social dimension of the information society.</P>
      <P>At national level, the equality agenda of my Department contributes towards the achievement of the Lisbon objectives. Specific initiatives being pursued by my Department include implementation of employment equality and equal status legislation which prohibit discrimination in relation to employment and the provision of goods, facilities and services on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community; supporting the supply of child care through the allocation of £250 million under the national development plan, NDP, equal opportunities child care programme together with Exchequer funding of £94 million to end 2006; supporting family friendly policies in employment, including increased maternity and adoptive leave and a review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998; funding under the NDP of £23.2 million for the equality for women measure; the incorporation of equal opportunities between men and women across the NDP; the establishment of the NDP equal opportunities and social inclusion co-ordinating committee to secure the maximum application of commitments on equal opportunities, particularly gender equality, and social inclusion across the plan; and the inclusion in the NDP of a programme to prepare prisoners for employment after their release.</P>
      <P>The role of the Equality Authority in working towards the elimination of conduct prohibited under equality legislation and the promotion of equality of opportunity in relation to matters covered under the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, also plays a significant part in promoting the objectives of the Lisbon Summit. Furthermore the Office of Director of Equality Investigations provides the main locus of redress of first instance in respect of equality cases.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme for 1998-99, I approved funding totalling almost £400,000 to five child care groups in south east Dublin. Details of funding under this programme are listed in Table 1 hereunder.</P>
      <P>The total amount committed by my Department so far under the equal opportunities childcare programme in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 to seven child care providers or child care groups in south east Dublin is almost £1.24 million. Over 98 new child care places will be created and the continuance of over 170 existing places in south east Dublin will be assured as a result of this funding committed. This funding will also lead to improvements in quality and, in some cases, allow child care providers extend their opening hours. Details of these child care providers or child care groups are outlined in Table 2 hereunder.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government's national child care policy has assigned county-city child care committees as the key local component in the development of a co-ordinated approach to quality child care. The county-city child care committees are charged with the responsibility for the effective inclusion of child care needs within the county-city development plans being drawn up by the county and city development boards. The county-city child care committees will work closely with the county development boards. Each committee will <Col N="406" /> develop a county-city child care plan, 2001 to 2006, which will cover the direction set out by each committee based on a shared vision and analysis of the needs within each city-county area.</P>
      <P>The structure of each committee is broadly based and representative of the key stakeholders in each area and is balanced to include representatives from the statutory sector, the social partners, local development-partnership groups, national voluntary child care organisations, parents and child care providers.</P>
      <P>A core budget of up to £50,000 is available, from my Department, to each county-city child care committee towards the administration and co-ordination costs of each committee.</P>
      <P>I have outlined, for the information of the Deputy, the up to date position on each county-city child care committee in the following table. The Deputy will understand that the work of the county committees has been delayed in some counties arising from the cancellation of meetings due to the foot and mouth crisis.</P>

      <P>The Constitution guarantees the free profession and practice of religion and it would be neither constitutional nor practical to proscribe or restrict organisations professing themselves as religious bodies. It would clearly be very difficult to distinguish in legislation between cults and established religions.</P>
      <P>I might also emphasise that no organisation is above the law. The constitutional freedom to practice religion is subject to public order and morality and no one, therefore, can shelter from the civil and criminal law behind a pretence of religious practice. No organisation may detain a person against his or her own will or in any other way act unlawfully and anyone who suspects that such an organisation is acting contrary to the law should report the matter to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I can again confirm to the Deputy that my Department has received the formal application for transfer of the person concerned from the United Kingdom authorities.</P>
      <P>I understand that in this case, the prisoner concerned has applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in the United Kingdom regarding his conviction. The Council of Europe convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 and 1997, require that an application can only proceed where the sentence imposed is final and that no appeals are outstanding. I have sought the advice of the Chief State Solicitor in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of the Chief State Solicitor will also have to advise me as to whether the acts or omis<Col N="408" /> sions constituting the offence concerned would also constitute an offence under Irish law and whether the sentence imposed by the sentencing state is compatible with the laws of this jurisdiction. This is also necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of the Council of Europe convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 and 1997. Following receipt of its advices in the matter I will be better placed to make a decision on the transfer application.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of organised criminal groups is determined each year using the European Union definition of organised crime to compile the EU situation report on organised crime. The most recently completed situation report identified 12 major organised crime groups and 68 other less significant organised crime groups. The Garda authorities have also informed me that a small proportion of organised crime groups have historical or current links to paramilitary organisations, although it is difficult to be precise about the exact nature of the links maintained by organised crime groups.</P>

      <P>During the period from 5 March to 24 April, I am informed that 14 larcenies from the person, that is, muggings, were recorded, of which seven have been detected, and that six larcenies from mechanically propelled vehicles were recorded, of which three have been detected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Garda Síochána has responded to the recent increase in this type of activity with intensified mobile patrolling and covert surveillance in the affected areas, utilising uniformed, plain clothes and specialised Garda units, as well as the CCTV system in the north inner city. As a result, I am informed that the Garda has solved most of the muggings which occurred in April. I am also informed that the <Col N="410" /> Garda is pursuing positive lines of inquiry where culprits have been identified, and it is expected that the detection rates for these crimes will increase for these areas.  </P>

      <P>The person referred to arrived in the State on 7 August 2000 and sought asylum. Following an interview, his case was deemed manifestly unfounded on 23 September 2000. His subsequent appeal was refused by the Appeals Authority on 6 October 2000.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the person in question was informed on 24 October 2000 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 days, leaving the State before the order was made or consenting to the making of the deportation order. Further to that correspondence, his legal representatives submitted various grounds on which the person referred to should be granted leave to remain in the State. Having considered the case file in the light of the relevant statutory provisions, I signed a deportation order in respect of the person referred to on 1 March 2001. In that context, I was required to take into account a number of factors under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, including humanitarian considerations and representations made by and on behalf of the person.</P>
      <P>The person referred to has been given leave by the courts to seek a judicial review of his case. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to take further action in the matter until the judicial review is determined.</P>

      <P>Enforcing the law in relation to drugs is one of the key strategic goals identified in the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy Document 2000-04. The area covered by the Border midland and western region incorporates nine Garda divisions and each district and division has drawn up specific plans to deal with drug distribution within their area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> Specific resources have been allocated to target drug dealers at a local level. Drug units have been established in Garda divisions with the specific remit of targeting local dealers and areas where drug dealing is believed to be taking place. A number of units have received tactical training in targeting operations. Covert operations, including Operation Cleanstreet have been undertaken by local gardaí with the assistance of the Garda National Drugs Unit.</P>
    <P>Provisional figures for the year ending 31 December 2000 show that over 277 cases under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act were detected throughout the BMW region. The Garda have also given drug talks in schools and to community and voluntary groups in the region as part of their demand reduction initiatives. A pilot education scheme, the SUMITT programme, has been developed in four counties in the region in collaboration with the Midland Health Board.</P>
    <P>A total of 14 Garda youth diversionary projects are currently in operation within the BMW region. These projects are designed to provide preventative and interventionary activities to young people thereby reducing the incentive for them to engage in anti-social activities including crime, vandalism and substance misuse. Policing plans are revised on an annual basis in order to ensure that strategies are kept up to date with requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the licensing laws were the subject of considerable review by the Oireachtas committee which reported in June 1998. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated, took into account many of the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee as well as submissions I received from groups and members of the public. During the passage of that legislation, I also took account of the views of Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the majority of persons who drink exercise a responsible attitude to alcohol consumption, and it would not be appropriate that measures taken to help curb drink abuse would have the effect of penalising those who behave responsibly. The new trading hours, introduced by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, reflect the changed pattern in drinking habits and are designed to facilitate the person who drinks responsibly. The Garda are <Col N="412" /> well aware of the importance of enforcing all aspects of the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>There are negative consequences that result from the abuse of alcohol. We are all too well aware of the contributing role which excessive alcohol consumption plays in fuelling criminal and anti-social behaviour. Many of the attacks and assaults that happen on our streets, particularly late at night, and sadly even among people of a young age, have their origin in excessive alcohol consumption. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, strengthened the law against under-age drinking and provided that, where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person is upheld, the licensed premises can be closed for a specified period. The additional provisions, in conjunction with the voluntary age card scheme, will assist in combating the scourge of under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>As to the immediate policing response, the Garda Commissioner has indicated on a number of occasions that special emphasis is being placed by the Garda on the enforcement of the law in relation to street crimes. A national public order initiative known as Operation Oíche has been launched by the Garda Commissioner to tackle street violence and public disorder on the streets of large towns and cities. This project essentially involves the strategic use of extra gardaí to tackle the problem of violence among young people at or in the vicinity of certain discos and places where youngsters gather at night. The operation focuses on the primary areas of public disorder, public intoxication, under-age drinking, illicit drugs use and underage alcohol sales. Operation Oíche began as a pilot scheme in Dublin, and was extended to large towns and cities which, in the Garda view, require a similar targeted response. Garda CCTV systems already in place have had a very beneficial effect in addressing a variety of public order offences.</P>
    <P>Particular operations such as those I have mentioned all require resources. I have been able to secure a significant and sustained increase in the resources allocated to the law and order system generally. This increase in resources has occurred across the entire criminal justice system, not only in relation to the Garda Síochána but in other areas such as the prisons and courts.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that on 1 November 2000 I established the Commission on Liquor Licensing under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes. The commission is required to take account of social and health interests, as well as licensing ones, in its deliberations. The membership of the commission represents a wide range of interests and the terms of reference include all aspects of the operation of the licensing laws, including an examination of systems in other countries. The first priority of the commission, as set out in its terms of reference, was to examine the nature of the off-licence and particularly the method of access to the off-licensed trade. The commission presented its interim report on the off-licensed sector to me on 23 April last.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> While legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme can help to curtail the problem of excessive drinking, it cannot be viewed as the total solution. Dealing with the excessive drinking problem should not be seen as the province of State agencies alone &ndash; parents, the drinks industry and the media too, must also play their part in helping to address the problem.</P>

However, the board considers that the Smithfield premises, which is new and purpose-built, will offer much improved facilities to clients, particularly in terms of access for older and-or disabled people, and that the new premises are readily accessible by public transport and, close to the proposed Luas line. I am assured that the board will endeavour to minimise the impact of the relocation of the law centre on its clients. I am also advised that the relocation to the Smithfield address should improve ease of access to the courts for the solicitors from the Mount Street centre and, as such, should assist the board in its efforts to increase the throughput of cases in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>The person referred to was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on 10 November 2000 for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He received an additional six month sentence on 28 November 2000 for damaging property intending to endanger life. With standard remission he is due for release on 10 May 2002. I have given this case careful consideration but I am not prepared to approve a transfer to an open centre at this early stage of his sentence. However, this case will remain under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital funding to sporting and community organisations is provided through the national lottery funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department. The main objectives of this programme are to: develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation. The facilities should be high quality, safe, well designed and sustainable to both the user and the provider; <Col N="422" /> prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities and encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
      <P>I have set out a schedule of the clubs and organisations, on a county basis, which received allocations under the Sports Capital Programme, 1998-2000, inclusive. The benefit accruing from the programme is that it has improved enormously the level of sporting and recreational facilities at a local, regional and national basis. In 1999 and 2000 alone, I allocated a total of almost £56 million under the sports capital programme for the provision of facilities for the parishes, towns and cities of Ireland. I have allocated £62 million in the three programmes since this Government took office, compared with a total of only £18 million allocated in the preceding three years.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2001 was advertised in mid-December 2000 with a closing date of 9 February 2001 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,450 applications were received and these are currently being assessed in accordance with the programme's assessment criteria. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Ringsend has been excluded from the RAPID programme; and if he will reconsider this decision in the light of the rates of early school leaving, number of dependants, number of lone parents and unemployment in the area.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The RAPID programme is committed to targeting investment under the national development plan on a priority basis to the 25 most disadvantaged areas in the State.</P>
      <P>The 25 areas selected represent the most deprived 5%district electoral divisions in the country. Ringsend is categorised as among the most deprived 10%, which is outside the qualifying category, the most deprived 5% of DEDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underpinning the selection of these 25 areas is the Trutz-Haase Index. This index uses variables drawn from the 1996 census of population data, including the percentage of the adult population leaving school early, the proportion of lone parents, the age dependency rate, and the unemployment rate in each DED. This was supported by data relating to significant incidences of rented <Col N="452" /> local authority housing and by the presence of disadvantaged schools as identified by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The fact that Ringsend is not a designated area under the RAPID Programme does not preclude it from benefiting from the support funds available under the national development plan under which £15 billion has been provided for social inclusion measures across the whole country. As a public representative of this area I will be endeavouring to ensure that the newly established Dublin City Development Board is kept fully aware of any problems that need to be considered in the Ringsend area under the social inclusion measures.</P>

In excess of 1,450 applications were received and these are currently being assessed in accordance with the programme's assessment criteria. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed. Under the assessment process, each application receives a score which decides its order of priority within its own county. Recommendations, based on conclusions from this process and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution, the population of the county and the quality of the applications from the county, are then made. Therefore, my Department's records on the programme are maintained on a county basis only.</P>

      <P>The Government set up the young people's facilities and services fund in 1998 to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The three year fund aims to attract young people in those areas at risk of becoming involved in drugs into more healthy and productive pursuits.</P>
      <P>Over £46 million has been allocated to date to support a variety of measures under the fund. I will forward to the Deputy the details of the projects involved in the very near future.</P>
      <P>It is expected that allocations under round two of the fund will be made in late 2002.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme for 2001 was advertised in mid-December 2000 with a closing date of 9 February 2001 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,450 applications were received, including one from the organisation in question. All applications are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> The grants under the sports capital programme are allocated on an annual basis and unsuccessful applicants may apply in the following years if they wish to be considered again for funding. Accordingly, there are no projects pending other than the 1,450 or so applications nationally which are currently being assessed under the 2001 programme for which closing date for receipt of applications was 9 February. There are 58 applications from County Kildare.</P>
    <P>In the case of the grants allocated under the 2000 sports capital programme, grantees have until 28 September 2001 to submit the necessary documentation and evidence that construction work has begun on the project. A number of these projects have already submitted the necessary documentation. The grants in those cases where work is still under way will be paid on receipt of the certificate of payment or invoices.</P>
    <P>In the case of grants allocated under the 1999 sports capital programme the grantees had until 30 September 2000 to confirm that work was under way. A substantial number of these projects have been completed while some are still in the course of construction. My Department is currently in contact with the organisations whose projects have not yet commenced or who have not yet submitted any of the required documentation, advising them that the grants are about to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>In the case of grants allocated under the 1998 sports capital programme, the grantees had until 30 June 1999 to confirm that work was under way. The majority of these grants have now been paid while a small number of projects are still in the course of construction.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year 2000 grants amounting to over £1 million were withdrawn from projects which did not commence on time or which failed to submit the necessary documentation to my Department by the due dates.</P>
    <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, I secured £45 million funding for an accelerated programme of investment over the three year period 2000-2002 for the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools. The package effectively increased the annual budget from £3 million to £15 million. During 2000 grants totalling £6.5 million were allocated towards the refurbishment of Roscommon pool and the construction of new pools in Dundalk and Courtown, County Wexford. Work is in progress on these pools.</P>
    <P>In 1999, two swimming pool proposals were received by this Department under the swimming pool programme. In 2000, local authorities were invited to submit updated proposals because of the increased funding secured and a total of 51 such proposals were received in my Department by the closing date of 31 July 2000. Decisions have been made on five of these applications and there are 46 proposals from local authorities under consideration at present, including two for County Kildare for pools in Naas and Athy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> Under the local authority swimming pool programme, there are outstanding commitments of £6,408,915 in 2001. Payments to date in 2001 are £402,190. In 2000 £5,793,454 was spent and £4,500,000 was spent in 1999 under this programme.</P>
    <P>My Department has also committed a grant of £5.95 million towards the construction of the national 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick. Construction of this pool is under way and is expected to be completed later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 595 and 648 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware the funding arrangements for our schools have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the traditional sectoral division of our second level system.</P>
      <P>I consider that the Blackstock report on the funding of second level schools, represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post-primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made in the Blackstock report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am aware of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and it is my intention to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the School Services Support Fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils now receives additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund channels an additional £7 million to schools each year. <Col N="463" /> While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding of second level schools in the light of available resources. I assure the Deputies that it is my intention that the recommendations of the Blackstock report on the funding of second level schools will inform policy on future school funding.</P>

      <P>Funds provided by my Department for a national adult literacy service are disbursed through the vocational education committees. The national development plan provides for an investment of £73.8 million to provide for an estimated 113,000 learners over the period 2000-2006. The provision in the education sector for adult literacy has increased from a base of £850,000 in 1997 to £10.677 million in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People catered for have more than trebled from 5,000 to over 17,000. Tuition is provided in 125 adult literacy schemes accommodated in over 560 venues. This is being supplemented by the development of TV and radio literacy awareness and tuition programmes, allied with free learner <Col N="465" /> resources packs and a helpline operated by the National Adult Literacy Agency, so that people can also learn in their own homes.</P>
    <P>Volunteers play a major role in the delivery of adult literacy services &ndash; over 3,700 people provide one to one tuition which is co-ordinated by adult literacy organisers employed by vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides grants to vocational education committees for community education, to support the provision of adult basic education, free or at nominal cost. This is generally used through the allocation by vocational education committees of teaching hours to a wide range of community interests. In addition, under the new back to education initiative, which will come on-stream shortly, providing a major expansion of part-time options in further education, it is intended that 10% of all expansion under the initiative will be earmarked exclusively for the community education sector. The initiative can be used as an important bridge for literacy students to more intensive options. A working group is finalising a framework for the initiative with a view to it coming on-stream in the autumn. </P>

      <P>My Department provides funds to the NALA for a range of inservice training initiatives in the field of adult literacy. These include: literacy awareness training; an NUI diploma provided by NALA in partnership with St. Patrick's College Maynooth, which is aimed at the integration of literacy tuition into vocational training programmes provided by FÁS, CERT, Teagasc and Youthreach instruction staff and was designed specifically with this target group in mind; and an NALA/Waterford Institute of Technology national certificate for tutors which is available to all literacy tutors. The NALA/Waterford Institute of Technology national certificate and diploma programmes are aimed specifically at adult literacy organisers.</P>
      <P>Modules of the NALA/WIT accredited courses are also being made available locally throughout the country on a single subject certification basis in order to increase local access.</P>
      <P>In addition, the option is available to literacy schemes to validate their initial training for tutors and volunteers with the Waterford Institute of Technology. Workplace literacy training is also provided, certified through the Open College Network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key objective is to ensure that literacy practitioners across the system have access to relevant ongoing training to upgrade their skills. These developments are allied with the imple<Col N="466" /> mentation of a quality framework devised with a range of transnational partners.</P>

      <P>Funds provided by my Department for a national adult literacy service are disbursed through the vocational education committees. The national development plan provides for an investment of £73.8 million to provide for an estimated 113,000 learners over the period 2000-2006. The provision in the education sector for adult literacy has increased from a base of £850,000 in 1997 to £10.677 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>Tuition is provided through the service to more than 17,000 adults in over 560 venues throughout the country. This is being supplemented by the development of TV and radio literacy awareness and tuition programmes, allied with free learner resources packs and a helpline operated by the National Adult Literacy Agency, so that people can also learn in their own homes. As many as 21 vocational education committees now provide family learning programmes, providing literacy help for both adults and children as part of the suite of options and these are continuing to expand. Such programmes usually provide for integrated collaboration between the adult education service, participating parents and local schools.</P>
      <P>Referral networks are operated by the vocational education committees which link the adult literacy service with schools, FÁS, welfare, health and employment services, libraries, area partnerships, community groups and employer interests. The objective of the networks is to promote awareness of the service, to provide a structured mechanism for the identification of area needs and the referral of those in need to the service.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides grants to vocational education committees for community education to support the provision of adult basic education free or at nominal cost. This is generally used through the allocation by vocational education committees of teaching hours to a wide range of community interests.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is a special school for pupils with mild general learning disability. In common with all special schools, the school in question is classified as a primary school.</P>
      <P>The basic staffing allocation to the school in question reflects the pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1 applicable to schools catering for children with a mild general learning disability. In addition, in order to address the particular educational needs of pupils of second level age attending the school, it is allocated a range of part-time teaching hours in areas such as arts and crafts, computer studies, home economics, physical education and woodwork.</P>
      <P>In accordance with circular 25/00, my Department will grant restricted recognition to teachers with a recognised post-primary qualification to enable them to teach in special schools where a proportion of the pupils attending the school are of post-primary age and where second level programmes are being provided by the school. This facility is available to the school in question.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have had discussions with the principal of the school in question on the possibility of adjusting current arrangements at the school to give greater recognition to the second level dimension of its activities. My Department is currently examining possibilities in this regard.</P>

      <P>Most school building projects are designed by private sector design teams engaged through the management authorities of the schools.</P>
      <P>The rate of progress to construction for large building projects depends on a number of factors, in addition to the availability of the appropriate technical and professional staff. Chief among these are the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the availability of funding, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors.</P>
      <P>While every effort is made to expedite the process, the arrangements leading up to the construction of a large number of buildings in accordance with current planning and building regulations are highly labour intensive and time consuming. My Department will continue to review procedures on an ongoing basis with a view to streamlining the school building process to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <P>The report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science on school transport in Ireland deals with a broad range of trans<Col N="469" /> port issues and contains many recommendations for changes to the school transport system.</P>
      <P>The report is the subject of an ongoing assessment, including costings, in the school transport section of my Department in consultation with Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. The Deputy will appreciate that, given the large number of these recommendations and taking account of staff limitations and the major implications in relation to funding, it is not possible to put all the recommendations in place with immediate effect.</P>
      <P>Some improvements have been announced in areas where assessments have been completed. These include extended eligibility for pupils where bullying is proven or the nearest school building is physically unsuitable. In January I announced a range of improvements to the school transport scheme. The new improvements will cost in the region of £2.85 million a year and include reducing the qualifying distance for primary school pupils aged ten or over from three miles to two miles so that all primary pupils will be treated equally for eligibility purposes; the number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new school bus service has been reduced from ten to seven; improvements have also been made in relation to remote area and scheme D grants and the qualifying distance for post-primary pupils residing a distance from a school bus route will be reduced from three to two miles; all school vehicles will have a communications system fitted on board during the course of this school year; arrangements will made for all buses to have first aid kits on board by the end of the year; and the travelling and waiting time for post-primary pupils is being reduced from three hours to 2.5 hours this year.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the support teacher project in operation in certain schools where there are significant numbers of pupils with disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviour. A total of 42 support teachers serve in the 48 selected schools. It is planned to have the project evaluated in 2002. Any extension of the support teacher project to additional schools will be addressed in the context of that evaluation.</P>

    <P>The national educational psychological service is available to assist schools in the management of pupils with behavioural difficulties. My Department also has a number of programmes in place to support pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in education. The programmes include the early start pre-school project, the home-school-community liaison scheme, <Col N="470" /> disadvantaged areas scheme and the new programme which I launched in January to tackle educational disadvantage in primary schools.</P>
    <P>The school in question has ex-quota teaching supports under a number of these programmes including early start, home-school-community liaison and the disadvantaged areas scheme. In addition, the school has two remedial posts and two shared special teachers. This school is also included in the urban dimension of the new programme and will be supported to maintain a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes over the next three years. The school will also receive an additional grant support of £3,103 in the current school year towards the provision of suitable in-school and out of school supports for the children that will be targeted under the programme.</P>

      <P>My Department has discussed the case raised by the Deputy with County Wexford VEC, the body responsible for the administration of the two grant schemes.</P>
      <P>The two persons, to whom the Deputy refers, are sisters, one of whom applied to County Wexford VEC for assistance under the ESF-aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees 1999 (now known as the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees). As the reckonable income was, at that time, within the relevant income limits attaching to the scheme, the candidate in question was eligible to receive a maintenance grant for the 1999-2000 academic year.</P>
      <P>The terms of the scheme state that the award of the grant is provisional for the 1999-2000 academic year and shall not be continued in any subsequent academic year unless the VEC is satisfied that the provisions of the scheme, including those relating to reckonable income, continue to be complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This candidate applied to renew her grant for the 2000-01 academic year. Her sister also applied for a grant under the ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses in 2000. On re-assessment, it was found that the reckonable income in their case exceeded the limits prescribed under the 2000 schemes and the candidates were, accordingly, deemed ineligible to receive maintenance grants for the 2000-01 academic year. My Department has been informed that as there was a delay in receiving all details of reckonable income for the relevant period, two monthly instalments of the maintenance grant were paid to one of the <Col N="472" /> candidates. County Wexford VEC has been in contact with the candidate regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>As the schemes of student support are of general application, it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases.</P>

      <P>It is the Government's policy that Traveller children participate in mainstream education in age-appropriate classes and in an integrated setting.</P>
      <P>To ensure that this policy translates into practice, my Department provides a range of supports. Capitation grants at enhanced rates are paid in respect of Traveller pupils in post-primary schools and my Department also sanctions additional teaching hours in respect of Traveller pupils enrolled in post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>My Department employs a national education officer for Travellers and provides a visiting teacher service for Travellers. The visiting teachers provide advice and support to schools and to Traveller families. This service is now provided on a nationwide basis.</P>
      <P>An application for increased resources, which has been received recently from the school concerned, is being considered by my Department. The school authorities and the Deputy will be notified of the outcome in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 619 and 620 together.</P>
      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of three new bodies: the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. I established the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland on a statutory basis on 26 February last and it is my intention to establish the new awarding councils in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objects of the Act are to establish and develop standards of knowledge, skill or <Col N="475" /> competence; promote the quality of further education and training and higher education and training; provide a system for co-ordinating and comparing education and training awards and to promote and maintain procedures for access, transfer and progression.</P>
    <P>The priority in nominating persons to these bodies is for those persons to have the necessary expertise and breadth of experience in the education and training area to enable them to fully contribute to the achievement of the objects of the authority and the Act.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>My approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the review, costings are being prepared on the effect of changes in the reckonable <Col N="477" /> income limits and the resource implications which such changes would involve.</P>

      <P>As stated in the previous reply, two NEPS psychologists have now been assigned to work exclusively in County Waterford. They have already begun work in schools.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision in 1999 to establish NEPS, a programme of recruitment for NEPS was immediately organised through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission in 1999. A panel of qualified educational psychologists was established in 2000. Thirty-one of these psychologists have taken up their posts and the 22 remaining psychologists from the panel are receiving their offers of employment and are taking up their posts.</P>
      <P>This school year the number of psychologists has been increased by 58 to 100 and a further 28 will be recruited before next Christmas. This will bring the total to 128, and the total will be brought to 200 as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The management committee of NEPS has recommended that each cohort of newly recruited psychologists should be divided equitably among the regions, according to the projected student numbers in each. On this basis, the targets for County Waterford are as follows: end 2001 &ndash; three psychologists; end 2002 &ndash; four psychologists; end 2003 &ndash; five psychologists. Achievement of these targets will depend upon factors such as the availability of suitably qualified psychologists in the region.</P>

      <P>The survey is now complete and the information has been passed to Area Development Management Limited for use in targeting State support to areas most in need of additional child care places. It is envisaged that where suitable school accommodation is identified and confirmed, appropriate supports including financial assistance will be made available to bring additional capacity on stream as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Following a recent decision of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion aimed at streamlining the processing of application for child care facilities, responsibility for State funding for school-based child care initiatives was transferred from my Department to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That Department has primary responsibility for the development and implementation of appropriate strategies in relation to child care provision.</P>
      <P>Some of the funding being provided is intended to promote the release of spare classrooms for use as child care facilities. Under this initiative, grants will be made available to schools where the management makes spare classrooms available for the provision of child care. The funding available could cover the refurbishment of the classroom as well as heating and insurance costs. Details of schemes to support schools in the provision of childcare facilities are currently being considered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My Department is co-operating fully with that Department in the development of these schemes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 343 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 324 pupils on 30 September 2000. An enrolment of 324 pupils warrants the staffing of a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the school will retain the services of a language support teacher, a special class teacher and two resource teachers for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
    <P>The organisation of classes is the function of the board of management of the school in question.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched in January to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school will receive supplementary grant aid of £4,412 towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned in respect of the current school year. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration, pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are however a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses, including those leading to the award of bachelor of education, on the basis that these courses in Ireland were subject to a quota based on policy decisions on the appropriate levels of graduate output.</P>
      <P>I announced, late last year, that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. In this context, issues which figure prominently in representations about student support, including the issue raised by the Deputy, will also be examined by the team. I will consider the appropriate response when I receive the team's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants are not payable in respect of undergraduate tuition fees outside the State. Since 1998-99 most full time students starting a third level-<Col N="488" /> higher education course in the United Kingdom have had a responsibility to make a contribution towards their tuition fees. For 2000-01, the maximum tuition fee contribution is £1,050. All EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee, subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students. This means that students from lower income families may be eligible for a grant toward tuition fees depending on their and their family's income.</P>

      <P>The transition year programme aims to allow students space to mature, to develop their study skills through exposure to innovative learning experiences and to give them experience of the world of work and the opportunity to reflect on that experience. The curriculum for the transition year in any given school is designed by that school in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department. One initiative taken by a school in Crumlin includes a module taken by students in transition year, with driving lessons for the same students in the course of their leaving certificate course, at the end of which they may apply to sit their driving test. It would be open to other schools to consider if they wish to take this approach. It would not, however, be appropriate to say that a particular area of learning will necessarily find a place in all transition year programmes.</P>
      <P>The fact that transition year students are not normally more than 16 years of age when they complete the transition year programme makes it impractical to provide &ldquo;driving tests&rdquo; for them.</P>
      <P>There are many modules available to schools that cover the areas of driving safety and road awareness in general. Some of these offer a combination of theory and simulated driving experience. Some are devised by individual schools. Some have been provided over the years by a range of bodies including the health promotion unit, the National Safety Council, the Garda Síochána and local authorities.</P>
      <P>At my request, the NCCA set in place a task force in autumn, 2000, to look at this whole area of driver education. The task force has just submitted its report to me and I will examine its recommendations in the coming weeks. The curriculum for primary and post-primary schools also includes the broader areas of traffic awareness and road safety awareness, as part of the social, personal and health education syllabus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently 649 persons paid at the unqualified rate on the payroll for primary teachers, who are teaching in a temporary capacity in primary schools.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the number of untrained personnel currently employed in primary schools. The difficulties in obtaining fully qualified teachers has arisen because of two main factors: this Government has increased demand for teachers generally by the creation of 2,315 posts to reduce the pupil &ndash; teacher ratio and to increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage; the number of trained teachers graduating from our training colleges had fallen to a very low level, for example, 291 graduated in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-2001 academic year. A further post graduate course commenced in February this year with an intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280.</P>
    <P>The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 academic years. Discussions are taking place with the colleges of education to provide a further post graduate course next year.</P>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. Bachelor of Education graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas's, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully-qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> There are currently 959 permanent teachers in primary schools on career break. A teacher seeking a career break must apply to the board of management of the school for approval. In considering the application the board of management should take cognisance of the availability of a fully qualified replacement teacher.</P>
    <P>The information regarding the number of children who are taught by unqualified teachers is not available.</P>

      <P>The initiative I announced in December 2000 is a highly innovative nationwide pilot scheme to assist second level students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. Thirty-one schools are participating in the pilot project costing £2 million. Each student with dyslexia will be provided with a laptop computer for school and home use. A grant of £2,700 per student will be paid for the purchase of laptops and software for those second year students identified as eligible for the project. Each school will receive £3,000 in grant aid to purchase back-up equipment for the project teachers. Dedicated teacher training will also be provided and the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, will co-ordinate the project. The project will explore innovative ways of using information and communications Technology, &ndash; ICT &ndash; to assist students' learning. Assistive technology can help students to work more independently within mainstream classes or in small groups and allow for flexibility in pupil learning.</P>
      <P>My Department also operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second-level schools towards the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment and software, for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties including severe dyslexia. The purpose of the scheme is to provide such pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. It is open to all second-level schools with such a pupil or pupils enrolled to submit an application under that scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the progress to date on his initiative launched in August 2000 to develop higher education and strengthen the education base in local regions; and when a report on this initiative is likely to be available.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Last August I announced my plans to strengthen the education base in a number of regions which are not well served at present and to establish effective links with higher and further education institutions. My intention is to address the related problems of non-completion at second-level and low participation rates in higher education, which are hampering development in these regions. I intend to put in place supports to encourage completion of the leaving certificate and to enable advancement to localised higher education opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After my announcement, the Ferns diocesan authorities responded by offering St. Peter's Col<Col N="496" /> lege, Wexford, as a location to facilitate development of a centre with higher education links. When I visited Wexford on 30 August last, I indicated that I was prepared to provide funding to establish an outreach centre at St. Peter's College. I indicated that I envisaged the proposed centre as having a local management body and a dedicated budget. I also identified the need for a project plan as a necessary preliminary to the establishment of the proposed centre. I suggested that a local co-ordinator-director be appointed to drive the project and draw up a project plan. At the request of the local steering committee I asked the director of the Institute of Technology, Carlow, and Wexford county manager to submit a proposal to my Department in this regard, which they duly did.</P>
    <P>The proposal submitted to my Department involves the creation of a new post. In this regard my Department and the Department of Finance have had ongoing discussions regarding the appointment of staff to progress my proposals at the local level.</P>
    <P>I also met with local representatives in Kilkenny last August. Both the National University of Ireland, NUI, in Maynooth and the Institute of Technology, Carlow, are involved in separate provision in the city. A detailed strategic plan for the development of the Kilkenny campus was sent to the Higher Education Authority. Pending discussions of the proposal with representatives of NUI Maynooth, the Higher Education Authority allocated £150,000 to the project in December 2000.</P>
    <P>Following discussion of the plan with representatives of the university, the Higher Education Authority provided detailed advice to my Department at the end of January on the general question of reach-out provision and on the specific issue of the university's involvement in Kilkenny. I have considered this advice carefully and will shortly make an announcement in respect of the provision in Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area, such as County Kildare, entails consideration by my Department of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.</P>
      <P>In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a likely long-term need for primary or post-primary educational facilities, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. High-quality temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Kildare has been the subject of regular review by my Department in recent years due to the extent of development taking place. As a result of these reviews, the need for additional school accommodation has been identified in a <Col N="500" /> number of areas, including Naas and Castledermot, and appropriate action to address these needs is being taken by the planning and building unit of my Department.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that, when the building projects involved are completed, there will be sufficient school accommodation to meet future needs. However, my Department will continue to monitor school accommodation requirements in the county to ensure that any emerging needs are addressed.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to establish an institute of technology in County Kildare, which is currently served by institutes of technology at Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Carlow, and, indeed, by the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>

      <P>The new £6.1 million arts and music grant which I recently announced was paid to all primary schools in County Kildare. The grant is intended to enable schools to purchase equipment and materials and to initiate activities to enable children to participate in visual arts, music, drama, dance and literature. The grant was based on a rate of £13 per pupil with a minimum grant of £780 being provided for schools of under 60 pupils.</P>
      <P>In the area of music, the grant may be used to support the &ldquo;making of music&rdquo; through the purchase of instruments such as chime bars, cymbals, triangles, tin whistles. It can also be used to buy listening materials such as compact discs, tapes. Similarly, in the visual arts, schools will be enabled to purchase materials such as brushes, drawing and colouring materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention that schools would, where possible, use some of this money to organise trips to concert halls, art galleries and similar institutions, so that children experience music, visual arts, drama, dance and literature in such settings.

These guidelines will issue to all schools shortly and will set out the scope of the grant and the purposes for which it can be used. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional per-capita grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum, £20 per pupil in respect of each service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional per capita grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
    <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33%, from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil, with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. The school referred to by the Deputy is currently funded under this scheme and a grant of £8,640 has recently been transferred to the school's bank account for the period January to December 2001.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first <Col N="504" /> time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, was increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and has further been increased this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as community employment schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>
