      <P>I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputy Naughten and I call on him to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the threatened blockade of the N5 over the June bank holiday weekend by road hauliers due to the substandard condition of that road; the fact that it is not planned to upgrade it for a further 15 years; the severe restriction this will impose on the development of the western region and the dramatic impact such a blockade would have on tourism in the region, which is on its knees due to both the foot and mouth disease restrictions and the Irish Rail strike last summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 50, Valuation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 6, Industrial Designs Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) Report and Final Stages of No. 50 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; and (2) questions shall be taken today from 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 50, at the end of the Order of Business yesterday we on this side of the House were of the view that No. 48 on yesterday's Order Paper, the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, would be put before the House this morning for debate. We now understand from media reports of briefings by the Government that it is the Government's intention to abandon the constitutional amendment. I put it to the Taoiseach that if this is so he should inform the House. He should also ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider his position because in the history of the State this is the first time that the incompetence and arrogance of a Minister&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;has brought about a situation where a constitutional amendment must be withdrawn from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter the House should have been entitled to at least the courtesy of the Taoiseach indicating why the proposals, which were so vehemently argued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with such extraordinary ineptitude, have been ignominiously withdrawn. The attempt to amend the Constitution in the manner proffered yesterday in such a ham-fisted way meant the Bill had to be withdrawn. I understand the Taoiseach's discomfort and why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present, but we are entitled to an explanation as to why the Bill <Col N="875" /> has been withdrawn and when the matter can be properly resumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following an exchange yesterday on the Order of Business, one of the items scheduled for the business of the House, Committee and Final Stages of the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001, was deferred. I indicated at that stage that we would do all we could, including holding it back, to get agreement today. I asked the Whips to meet which they did, but there was no agreement there. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform met the Opposition spokespersons, Deputy Shatter and Deputy Howlin, to see if a satisfactory and mutually acceptable arrangement could be made for this House and the Seanad to pass the remaining Stages of the Bill so that the referendum could be held with the other referenda on 7 June.</P>
      <P>I regret to inform the House that this did not prove possible. Despite every reasonable effort on the part of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accommodate the Opposition concerns as to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment, it was not possible to reach agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no difficulty. Of course it was possible, entirely possible. The Government has no confidence in its own proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of this, the Government must decide an appropriate course of action. The outcome of this consideration is that we believe it would be inappropriate to put our proposal before the people on 7 June in these circumstances. The Government considered that a fundamental proposal touching on the separation of powers between the respective organs of Government in the State should not be pro<Col N="876" /> ceeded with in a situation in which there is such fundamental disagreement as was seen in this House on Tuesday night. I do not wish to go back on all the arguments. Anyone who thinks that this all started with the legislation is not well briefed on the situation.</P>
      <P>This proposal was examined by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I do not wish to become adversarial about it. One aspect in the report of the all-party committee which was endorsed by the Opposition was that judicial conduct, as distinct from judicial decisions, may be reviewed by the Judicial Council, the composition of which includes a lay element and whose powers, duties and functions may be determined by law.</P>
      <P>in the amendments submitted by the Opposition and in discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night, it was very clear that the Opposition was insisting that the entire membership of the Judicial Council should be set out in the Constitution. Deputy Shatter wanted bodies and officers, for example, the Bar Council, which are otherwise not mentioned in the Constitution, to be included.</P>
      <P>There were four Government amendments, not 14 as was claimed yesterday. The constitutional amendment proposed by the Government is a significant improvement on existing constitutional provisions. Unfortunately, there is no agreement in the House and I will not allow a constitutional arm of the State to be used as a political football in any referendum.</P>

I put it to the Chair that it is very unusual that a constitutional amendment is withdrawn. <Col N="879" /> The Chair has certain discretion but I will not raise the temperature of the House. I have a suggestion that will be of benefit not only to the House but to the Government and if I could make it, at the Chair's discretion, I will not seek to be disorderly in any way other than in the&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has pointed out that there is a facility in Standing Orders, under Leaders' Questions, to raise these matters. That is what that time slot is for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but my understanding of the Standing Order which allows Leaders' Questions is that they should refer to topical issues of the day as distinct from matters of procedure and order in the House. This is effectively about the ordering of business. That is not the intention of Leaders' Questions and we can rescue something from this fiasco if the Taoiseach will listen to a proposal I have. We could then proceed in a very orderly manner.</P>
      <P>I suggested last Tuesday that we should try to get consensus on this matter across the House. The way to do that is to refer this legislation to an all-party committee of the House, the committee on justice, which would hear evidence, listen to outside submissions and then report to the House in a manner which would allow us to proceed on an all-party basis to a referendum. That is what I want. It would rescue something from the fiasco created by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While proposing amendments to meet our requirements he simultaneously launched an outrageous attack on Deputy Owen. That is no way to do business and the Taoiseach needs to talk to his Minister.</P>

However well briefed the Taoiseach may have felt he was when reading his prepared script, he was very poorly informed and I would contest the accuracy of what he put on the record. I am bound by Standing Orders in respect of this but if the Taoiseach responds to Deputy Noonan's proposal then we can discuss the matter at the Chair's discretion. It should be clearly stated on behalf of my party colleagues who attempted to negotiate with the so-called Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that what the Taoiseach put on the record this morning is not true.</P>

      <P>Today, as the House is aware, is World Asthma Day. I am sure the Taoiseach will join me in congratulating the Asthma Society of Ireland for its excellent work in educating and informing people about asthma to help them achieve better control of their condition. Ireland has the fourth highest incidence of the disease in the world and 143 people died of asthma last year in Ireland. It is the commonest illness among children and one in seven children in Ireland have asthma. Despite the fact that asthma is a long-term illness and can be effectively controlled with proper use of medication, asthma sufferers are not afforded the benefits of the long-term illness scheme. The only thing this Government has done in four years in office for the 250,000 asthma sufferers is to make them pay more for their medication through changes in the drug refund scheme. On World Asthma Day, will the Taoiseach make some gesture towards asthma sufferers and towards the cost of their medication?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the ravages of asthma as siblings of mine have suffered from it on occasion. Happily they have survived and continue to survive but it is not a disease that goes away. If any disease could be categorised as a long-term illness, it is this one. It rises and falls with savage effect on occasion. This is a concise example of how this Government, a very bad Government at the best of times, could, through a simple measure, have delivered long-term relief for 250,000 of our citizens and has significantly failed to do so. I urge the Taoiseach to note the day that is in it and to give a commitment to at least recognise the reality that asthma is a long-term illness.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be associated with World Asthma Day. I commend the work of the Asthma Society of Ireland and like other Members wish to be associated with their activities today. I am aware of the number of people who suffer from asthma. I am well aware of the difficulties caused to them and to their extended families, but also of the extensive work that is done for over 250,000 people who suffer from asthma. For the first time in many years, asthma sufferers are being allowed to put their case and suggest a strategy for a radical overview of the health service. When I met their representatives last week, they made clear they acknowledge what has been done for them by the State for many years. Like all groups and associations, they have the right to seek improvements and I expect them to express that right. The Government is obliged to continue to make State resources avail<Col N="882" /> able to those who suffer from asthma and other ailments.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's association with my words about the Asthma Society of Ireland but fine words butter no parsnips. The Government's actions have made medication for asthma sufferers more expensive, not less. To mark World Asthma Day, does the Taoiseach commit to adopting the Fine Gael policy of providing free medication to those who suffer from the condition? The GMS scheme must be used to treat asthma as the long-term illness that it is.</P>

      <P>It is nice to make such points in Opposition, but Deputy Noonan had a personal opportunity to deal with this problem when in Government.

Hopefully, Deputy Quinn will support the Minister's strategy in trying to improve this situation.</P>

      <P>Was the Taoiseach informed or consulted by the Minister for Finance or the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners about proposals announced yesterday to deal with those who benefited as owners of bogus non-resident accounts, as revealed by the DIRT inquiry? Will the Taoiseach agree to the Labour Party spokesperson on Finance, Deputy McDowell's request that the Minister for Finance and the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners come before the finance committee to outline in detail what it is proposed to do as a result of the widespread concern that surrounds this issue? There is a suspicion that wrongdoing will once again be rewarded.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners informed the Government that they would respond to the Public Accounts Committee's request and that they would bring forward their procedures to do so. The Government did not engage in discussion regarding how this would be done as it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners alone. Such debate would only arise if they sought additional amended regulations or legislation, which did not happen. As we know, the Revenue Commissioners yesterday issued a statement of practice on how they are to collect the tax due on the underlying income concealed <Col N="883" /> in bogus non-resident accounts which were the subject of the DIRT inquiry, but this is a matter for the commissioners alone.</P>
      <P>The PAC's recent report recognised the scale of the task it recommended to the Revenue Commissioners, which was to deal with the assessment and collection of underlying tax in a pragmatic and effective manner, while safeguarding the State's overall tax revenue. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioner's comments yesterday indicated he will be glad to outline how and why he sees this as the best way forward, but that is a matter for him and I cannot instruct him.</P>

      <P>Relevant to legislation to amend the Constitution, is the Taoiseach aware of the proposals of the draft report of the all-party committee that measures taken to amend the Constitution should be fully debated by the Dáil and that an adequate period of time should be mandatory? A recommendation was made that we amend the Constitution to ensure that a Bill to amend the Constitution could not be passed unless three months had elapsed since the date of the Bill, except with the concurrence of the President in an emergency after consultation with the Council of State. Is the Taoiseach aware that the draft report proposes to amend Standing Orders to that effect as an interim measure?</P>
      <P>Taking all that into account, will the Taoiseach confirm that the situation that prevailed regarding the judicial conduct Bill will not recur in any future proposal to amend the Constitution? The Bill was circulated on 22 March, but did not conform to the proposals of the all-party committee so the Government attempted to guillotine it after two hours on Committee Stage. Does the Taoiseach agree that the considered proposals of the all-party committee should be taken into account in future so that we have full and detailed consideration of any proposal to amend the basic laws of the State, which our Constitution deserves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;apart-hotel' means one or more apartments, including any ancillary facilities associated with such apartments, which are used for the purposes of the trade of hotel-keeping;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the views expressed on Second and Committee Stages by a number of Deputies on all sides of the House on the need to ensure aparthotels are subject to rates. Having considered the issue further, I am making this set of seven amendments to put the question of the rateability of aparthotels beyond doubt.</P>
      <P>Devising a suitable formula of words was not easy. I do not consider bed and breakfast accommodation and genuine self-catering accommodation can be made subject to rates at this time. Any amendment made must recognise that reality. However, the position of aparthotels, as Deputies stressed in earlier discussions, is different. I agree they should be subject to rates, which some of them already are. These amendments provide for the rating of apartments where a number of them are used for the provision of short-term self-catering accommodation, have ancillary facilities associated with them and are effectively used for the purposes of the trade of hotel-keeping.</P>

Will the Minister of State spell out matters? Where is the dividing line? What does &ldquo;self-contained&rdquo; mean? Aparthotels are more or less at the top end of the spectrum. Some Deputies referred to large style self-catering accommodation or guesthouses that would have up to 80 rooms. Will this provision relate only to aparthotels and not other categories of accommodation? This provision is welcome in so far as it goes. The campaign for changes may continue, but I appreciate the Minister of State is making a change. The private sector is developing new forms of residential or hotel units all the time. It is important to ensure legislation is introduced to bring some of them into the rates net as the opportunity permits. I appreciate the changes brought forward.</P>

Deputy Ahern is right about the definition. I must be specific. It will cater for a specific part of the market, particularly in Dublin, that was not subject to rates previously. The way I have carefully constructed the issue has brought certainty to the position. I am happy there will be certainty on this matter for local authorities throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition the Minister proposes inserting defines an aparthotel as one used for the purposes of the trade of hotel-keeping. Is there a definition of hotel-keeping? I do not see one in the Bill. Are we sure we are providing certainty here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are. The above amendments provide for the rating of apartments where a number of them are used for the provision of short-term self-catering and are effectively used for the purposes of the trade of hotel-keeping. The wording which provides for the rating of apartments and aparthotels does not make houses subject to rates even where they are used in the same manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know what aparthotels are. I am familiar with one in my constituency and was able to use it as an example. A major hotel built an apartment block 20 yards away and used it as an aparthotel, whereby all the paying customers could utilise the full facilities of the hotel, includ<Col N="891" /> ing the leisure, swimming and dining facilities etc. From the consultations I have had with those involved in this area, everyone is satisfied that they know what we are talking about when we talk of aparthotels. I did not realise it is defined in the dictionary, which was a help in defining it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ahern said, it is not a perfect science as there are areas that are clearly excluded. I am not prepared to go into those other areas. As Deputies said, there are new modern ways of doing business and this is one of them. I am satisfied they should be subject to the payment of rates. The local authorities are equally satisfied with what I have put forward. I am sure it will enormously aid the situation in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 defines various terms used throughout <Col N="892" /> the Bill. Charitable organisations is one of the terms so defined. The definition of charitable organisations sets out the requirements that a company or other body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons must comply with conditions to be accepted as being a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Valuation Bill and thereby qualify for exemption from rates in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the case of a company, it is required, among other things, as set out in subsection 1(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the definition that its memorandum of association or articles of association, as appropriate, contain a provision with respect to a case of its being wound up voluntarily. That provides for the disposal of any surplus property arising on its being wound up to another charitable organisation within the meaning of this Bill, the main object or objects of which are similar to its main object or objects, or if the body receives a substantial proportion of its financial resources from a Department of State or an office or an agency, whether established under enactment or otherwise of the State, to such a Department, office or agency. As surplus property may arise in a situation where the company is being wound up involuntarily as well as where it is being voluntarily wound up, the word &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; is being deleted from subsection 1(<i>b</i>)(i) to cover such an occurrence, even if it is not likely to occur very frequently.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" />&ldquo;&lsquo;valuation manager' shall be construed in accordance with <i>sections 19</i> and <i>62</i>;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Valuation Bill, the person appointed as valuation manager by the Commissioner of Valuation under Section 19(2) to organise and secure the carrying out of a valuation on a rating authority area, is given specific functions and responsibilities under various sections of the Bill. The same broadly applies, although in a less detailed way, in the case of a person appointed a revision officer by the Commissioner under Section 28, to deal with an application for a revision.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that the Bill, through various sections, provides the Commissioner with the power to remove and/or replace, where appropriate, the person initially appointed valuation manager or revision officer. Sections 9(11), 10 and 11 are of relevance in this regard. However, I have also been legally advised, that in the light of the importance of this issue and of the very specific functions and responsibilities given in the Bill to the person appointed valuation manager or revision officer, that an amendment should be introduced to put this issue beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the new section being introduced to the Bill, clearly provides the Commissioner of Valuation with the authority, where necessary and desirable to remove and/or replace, where appropriate, the person initially appointed valuation manager or revision officer, without it in any way impacting on the legal validity of the valuation or revision in question, which has not yet been completed. As Deputies will appreciate, the need for the Commissioner to be able to remove and/or replace a valuation manager or revision officer could arise for many reasons, including the inefficiency or long-term illness of the person concerned. Also, the person appointed could die, retire, resign, get promoted or move to another post within the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>Although I am recommitting it, I think there was some reference to this by Deputy McDowell at some stage, possibly in a slightly different context, but it comes back into the same arena of giving certainty in that regard.</P>

      <P>In page 23, to delete lines 22 to 34.</P>
      <P>Section 25 provides that the commissioner should cause a valuation of each rating authority to be undertaken not less than five years and not more than ten years since the previous valuation of the relevant rating authority was undertaken. Subsection (3) of this section provides that, where a period of more than ten years elapses between two valuations, that fact shall not be regarded as constituting a failure by the commissioner to comply with carrying out the revaluation on time, if (a) a valuation order was made in relation to the rating authority area concerned before the lapse of that period and, due to exceptional circumstances outside the control of the commissioner, the valuation concerned was not completed before the period lapsed, and (b) the commissioner takes all reasonable steps to ensure, as soon as practicable after that lapse, that the valuation is completed and the relevant valuation is caused to be published.</P>
      <P>In the light of the discussion on this point at Committee Stage, and to ensure that there is no doubt or misunderstanding about the commitment that the valuations of every rating authority area will be carried out at least every ten years, I have decided to delete subsection (3) of this section. This is a big change from the current situation where the complete country has not been revalued in nearly 150 years. This meets the points which were raised and I was happy to take them on board to give that absolute certainty.</P>

      <P>In page 25, line 22, to delete &ldquo;, or as soon as possible thereafter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have considered again the time periods provided in the Bill for the Valuation Office, the Commissioner and the Valuation Tribunal to complete certain activities, in the light of the discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 28(5), 33(6) and 37(2) provide in each case a period of six months, &ldquo;or as soon as possible thereafter&rdquo;, for the Valuation Office to complete a revision, the Commissioner to complete an appeal to him, and for the Valuation Tribunal to complete an appeal to it of the Commissioner's decision. I have decided that the six months period should now be made a strict limit in each case. I am therefore deleting the phrase &ldquo;or as soon <Col N="895" /> as possible thereafter&rdquo; from each of these three subsections.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that such time periods provided in the Bill for the Valuation Office, the Commissioner and the tribunal to undertake the operations in question were not meant to be and are not soft options. In this regard I point out that, under law, the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible thereafter&rdquo; is not an open ended time period, as it may well at first sight appear to be. It requires the person or body to complete the activity in question where possible, within the period set down. The time can only be extended for a sound justifiable reason, and the extension should then be for the shortest duration reasonably practicable to complete the activity in question.</P>
    <P>Under the current valuation code, while a time limit applies to completing a revision, there are no time limits set within which the commissioner is required to complete an appeal to him, or for the tribunal to complete an appeal to it, of the Commissioner's decision. Therefore, the Bill for the first time applies time limits for completing appeals in two important areas of the valuation process, where currently none exist. Given the likely increase in workloads for each of these bodies following the enactment of the Bill, the six months time limit may well prove not to be an easy one to fulfil. That period includes any time spent obtaining information from the occupier.</P>
    <P>The point I made is that, even though I did not intend the phrase &ldquo;or as soon as possible thereafter&rdquo; to be unduly flexible, I have removed it for absolute certainty. I thank the commissioner and the staff of the valuation office, who are quite happy to live with this and other relevant amendments. It demonstrates the commitment of the valuation office to complete a major undertaking of great importance to the running of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The major problem in the valuation of property is very often with new properties. Revaluations do not make a great difference from the point of view of the rating authority, because the property is already in the net. However, in the case of new property, long delays have occurred in the valuation being made and, consequently, rates on that property are lost. I am aware of a situation where rates on a very substantial new property were lost for a period of two years, due to delay in doing the valuation. The valuation cannot be backdated, but must apply from the date on which it is set. Accordingly, the rates are permanently lost in that situation.</P>
      <P>Any delay in the valuation process is a matter of concern. I do not know where the initiative has to come from to initiate the valuation in the first instance, whether it is from the local authority or elsewhere. I have seen properties which were benefiting from tax breaks not being valued for two years or more. That seems inequitable, particularly if the property is owned by some of the richest people in the country.</P>

Properties can now constantly be added to the rate roll so we will no longer be in the position of having to wait or having properties avoid paying rates for a year by missing getting on the valuation lists. The Valuation Office is now fully up to speed on all new properties under the new system. A lot of new technology has facilitated that and it will be of great assistance to the commissioner and the Valuation Office in terms of this whole new procedure. It would not be possible to do it within the current short timeframe unless we had the modern technology in place.</P>
      <P>My answer to Deputy McDowell is that acute problems can always be resolved. I do not anticipate that there will be major problems. If there was some very serious problem, it would have to come back to the House and the legislation would have to be amended. That is not my intention. The Bill is enough at present. I speak fundamentally of the ten year position. Something could fundamentally change over ten years but the commissioner and the Valuation Office are happy they will meet the deadlines and therefore I have given certainty to that.</P>

      <P>I understand and appreciate what the Minister says. I know that one is in trouble when one starts adding hypotheses to legislation. Nonetheless it will happen. As sure as night follows day there will be some default at some point in the future. There must be some provision relating to what happens in the circumstances of a revaluation not being carried out or an appeal not being heard or decided upon within the strict deadlines imposed. It will happen so we need to know what will apply in those, I hope, very limited and exceptional circumstances. I suggest the Minister should give it some thought between now and discussion in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I take the point. It was one of the serious considerations I had in changing this because the phrase &ldquo;or as soon as possible thereafter&rdquo; is very specific. It is not open-ended and I decided to remove it. The commissioner and the Valuation Office are prepared to live within those limits. If I was to base all legislation on the exception rather than what I expect to happen I would have tomes of stuff written into legislation in a protective sense. The bottom line is that if a crisis arose I would have to return to the House for amending legislation. I do not propose to go back on the changes I have made. I may give some thought to it in the context of the Seanad but I am happy with it as it stands.</P>

      <P>It seems there is an element of self-valuation being brought in here. If we were all to have the opportunity of self-valuation of property we might use it to avoid high rating valuation.

This provision leaves people with the opportunity of self-valuation and hence I want it deleted.</P>

      <P>Both of these amendments relate to the requirements in the Bill on the appellant to provide an opinion of value when appealing to the commissioner and the tribunal. The appeal will take place after the consultation phase during which the Valuation Office will have provided the occupier with a copy of the valuation report and an opportunity to discuss the valuation. In the <Col N="898" /> vast majority of appeals the appellant will be appealing the amount quantum of the valuation fixed on the property rather than a point of law.</P>
      <P>Quantum appeals arise where the occupier or agent has arrived at a valuation which is different from the valuation being appealed. In the context of the Valuation Office having made available its valuation report, it is only reasonable that the appellant discloses his or her valuation. That would be the basis of the argument. If one has been given a valuation and does not agree with it, obviously one has something in mind based on what one believes is fair. This was an issue that came up in discussion around the country.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to do is to be fair to the ratepayer whom I brought more centre stage in the context of this whole area. I tried to put the ratepayer in a position where the system was fair to him or her. In the current system the majority of agents, even though they are not by law required to do so, put forward their estimate of value and the basis for it. That is the basis of the argument &ndash; they do it anyway but they do not have the right to do so. This facilitates the processing of appeals. In the context of moving to a more open and transparent process with the ratepayer at centre stage it is important that both sides contribute to making the appeals system more streamlined and efficient. Consequently, I do not consider that it is unreasonable to ask the appellant or agent to state an opinion of value. The ratepayer would probably have a heart attack if not allowed to do that.</P>

The proposed amendment could well be seen to undermine the independence of the commissioner in processing appeals. The commissioner in any event, like other officials dealing with appeals, is bound by the principles of natural justice. In addition, appellants also have access to the valuation tribunal and the courts against the commissioner's decision. It would not be wise to accept the Deputy's amendment in this context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 provide that the annual report of the commissioner of valuation to the Minister for Finance on the performance of his or her functions by the commissioner, under this Bill, in a particular year should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. They also provide that such reports shall include information in such form, and regarding such matters, as the commissioner thinks fit or the Minister may direct. While the current section 41 is silent on the point, <Col N="900" /> it was always the intention that the commissioner's annual report would be published.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 21, section 41 now provides that the Commissioner of Valuation shall make a report to the Minister for Finance on the exercise of his or her responsibilities under this Bill in the previous calendar year no later than two months after each year end. The Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. It should not be written into law that every such report should be the subject of public hearings in the appropriate Oireachtas committee within a specified period of publication. It is unlikely that every report will be of such importance as to warrant such a public hearing. The Oireachtas, I strongly believe, should be left with the discretion as to hold public hearings or not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell knows that the commissioner, as accounting officer of the valuation office, appears before, and is answerable to, the Committee of Public Accounts and this will continue to be so. The report is likely to be raised at the Committee of Public Accounts if necessary.</P>

This is a repeat of the existing provision and the amendment proposes to change this to the position where a tribunal member who stands for election only ceases to be a member if he or she is actually elected to either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I consider this change appropriate. No unnecessary disincentive or obstacle should be put in the way of a suitable person standing for election to the Dáil, Seanad or the European Parliament. This view was strongly expressed recently in the other House in a long discussion when the Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, 2000, was being considered. People in politics, or aspiring to be so, should not be automatically excluded from a whole range of bodies. This was implemented in the Ordnance Survey Bill, which will be coming back to this House, and I will be consistent in this Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 60, line 6, after &ldquo;sport&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or recreation in so far as same is carried on or operated for reasons other than profit&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> The primary purpose of amendment No. 30 is to extend the definition of &ldquo;community hall&rdquo; to include family recreation centres and some clubs. The definition in the Bill specifically excludes club premises. I assume that means any case members have contributed or are contributing towards purchase and upkeep of a property. In my constituency, for example, thousands of people have contributed towards the costs of constructing and maintaining what is, effectively, a community hall. I refer specifically to the Artane-Beaumont Family Recreation Centre. Virtually every family in the parish of Beaumont has contributed towards its construction and upkeep. It is a community hall in all but name, but it is owned by a club.</P>
    <P>A difficulty arises in that there is a bar in this premises. I accept that the part of the building that is used as a bar should be rated. However, it would seem reasonable, and certainly not beyond the wit of local authorities, to divide the premises between the part which is used for profit and the part which is not, even though the profit goes effectively towards the maintenance and upkeep of the property. In this case a huge area is used for volleyball, basketball and so on. I want to define &ldquo;community hall&rdquo; rather more broadly than it is defined in the Bill in order to include that sort of premises.</P>
    <P>The other purpose of the amendment is to broaden the definition of sport to include recreation. There can be difficulty in defining what sport is. For example, activities such as snooker or keeping pigeons might not, strictly speaking, be defined as sport. Therefore, in so far as a premises is used for recreation, and provided it is not profit making, it would be within the principles that underlie our valuation legislation that it should be excluded from rates.</P>
    <P>We also had a discussion on Committee Stage about buildings, as opposed to land, which are used for sport. The schedule in the Bill excludes land used for sport. However, buildings such as stadia, albeit very small stadia in some cases, or even changing rooms, can be rated. I understand they are rated and that seems unreasonable. We should make specific provision to exclude those from rating, from the valuation lists.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment No. 30 prompted me to ask a question in relation to the definition in Schedule 4. Having read that and having followed some of the proceedings on Committee Stage, I was under the impression that the example, to which I will refer, was already covered, and it may well be. I am seeking clarification from the Minister. I refer to Lahinch Sea World and swimming pool which faces massive annual rates in excess of £7,000. There are small commercial elements to it. The swimming pool is effectively a community pool for the entire north Clare area. The body which built it and runs it is a non-profit community group and is, effectively, a loss-making group for most of the time. The pool complex is profitable, or at least breaks <Col N="905" /> even, during the summer and, in an attempt to reduce losses, it is closed for the winter season. On my understanding of the Bill, it should be open to the local authority not to rate the element which is effectively a community swimming pool. That would have the benefit that the pool could remain open for the year and be available to the community, rather than being closed down to make savings. It is quite similar to the example given by Deputy McDowell except that, unfortunately, it does not have a bar in terms of revenue-making. It does have a very modest coffee shop and the sea world element. However, local communities have gone to enormous trouble to raise funds to provide it, and it is a great pity that it should be available only as a tourist facility in the summer when it is the wish of the committee that it be available for schools, community groups and individuals for the entire year. If it is not already covered in the Bill, it might be covered by the amendment proposed by Deputy McDowell. I urge the Minister to consider that point.</P>

I am sure there are also projects like this in the Minister's constituency.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies.

I hold equally strong views and I want to move in a certain direction in this area and be absolutely clear and certain, for the first time in legislation, as to what the position is, because there seem to be differences throughout the country with different local authorities taking different views.</P>

    <P>Under current valuation legislation, all land, excluding buildings, used for or developed for sport is exempt from rates. This means that the playing field, outdoor tennis court, golf course and so on are exempt from rates, but club houses, bars, changing rooms, locker rooms and so on are rateable. I have examined further the issue of the rating of sports and recreation facilities in the light of the discussion on Committee Stage of the Valuation Bill. I am satisfied that the definition of &ldquo;community hall&rdquo; in the Bill allows for the exemption from rates of a building comprising dressing rooms, changing rooms used in connection with a playing field, or a building used by a rowing club or other such sporting body, provided it is not licensed and is not used for profit or gain. The same would apply to a community <Col N="906" /> recreation facility. However, if the sporting or recreation complex is licensed, the entire property will be rateable. I consider that this should be the position. Consequently, I do not accept that the amendments are necessary.</P>
    <P>It will now be absolutely certain that a sporting facility comprising buildings housing changing rooms, dressing rooms and so on, will no longer be rateable if there is no licensed premises on the property. However, I have to draw the line somewhere. Deputies participating in the debate were talking about small clubs and facilities. In the case of the example given by Deputy Killeen, if a pool is a community pool and is not run for profit or gain, it will now be exempt. If it is a commercial operation, privately run, privately operated and a profit is being made, it would be rateable. If it is clearly a community facility that the community uses and is not a profit making facility, then it is not liable for rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Killeen was that some of these facilities are commercial in the summer but not during the rest of the year and are, more or less, put at the disposal of the community. Is there some scope for seasonal valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates are based on a valuation. The valuation takes account of what the commercial activity is. If it is not operational for half the year, the rates reflect that and it will clearly be reflected in this Bill. That has already been taken account of. I am moving quite a distance to meet what the Deputy said and I am very happy that it will be fixed. I am taking away the uncertainty from local authorities and I am making it absolutely certain. As I have defined it, the clubs and sporting bodies about which we talked on Committee Stage will, effectively, no longer pay rates on their buildings, locker rooms, changing rooms, etc. That is a major move. If a separate legal body occupied the commercial elements of it, the community pool aspect would remain exempt. I am talking about a pool in terms of a local authority or a community, but when I talk of a coffee shop, it is different. I am bringing certainty to this and it should be largely welcomed by all our sporting bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused as to what the Minister is doing. I have just been reading the definition of &ldquo;community hall&rdquo;. It specifically excludes club premises. Perhaps I am reading it wrongly. It refers to premises being registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904. Does that refer simply to licensing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should read out what that actually means. I should have said it earlier but for certainty, I will read out what it states. Where a sporting club is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, all buildings occupied by that club will be rateable. Where a sporting club is not registered, its buildings will be exempt under the definition of &ldquo;com<Col N="907" /> munity hall&rdquo; provided it is not used for profit or gain. The main purpose that a club would register under the 1904 Act is that the club can get a licence to sell drink without having to buy an existing licence holder's. That is why I specifically put that in there. It gives a good definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister of State said. I just do not see how it relates to the definition of &ldquo;community hall&rdquo; in the Bill. The definition goes on to state &ldquo;occupied by a person who ordinarily uses it, or permits it to be used, for purposes which involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally&rdquo;. For example, the Minister of State mentioned a rowing club premises or something of that kind. I can see that local authorities might very well take the view that it is not used by inhabitants of the locality generally but by club members, for the sake of argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am clarifying it with certainty because it was not heretofore the case. To my knowledge, the situation at present is that many clubs in different local authorities are paying rates on facilities in which there are not licensed premises. That will no longer be the case. As regards the points made on Committee Stage, we had a very interesting and worthwhile discussion. I am absolutely certain about this and there is no confusion in this regard.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister of State's word for it and, I hope the commissioners will act on what he has just said. I still think there is a difficulty with what Deputy Killeen said and the example I gave earlier where one has, effectively, a commercial element or something that is being <Col N="908" /> run in order to make money but that money is then being used to subsidise the community aspect of what is happening within a particular structure. The example I gave &ndash; a bar &ndash; is, admittedly, not the sort of example most likely to appeal to the Minister of State or anybody else but perhaps the coffee shop example is a better one in that sense. Of course, one runs a coffee shop to make a few shillings or a few euros but those euros are then used to sustain something which would otherwise be loss making and which has a community purpose. The overall purpose of the exercise is not to make money but there is an element in it which is profit-making.</P>

      <P>I got off to a good start anyway. I heard what the Minister of State said about swimming pools. It is essential that pools, which are community based, are exempt from rates. That is of paramount importance. In some counties, where swimming pools are owned by the local authorities, they do not charge rates. In Birr, Clara and Edenderry, the local authority gives a type of grant in lieu of the rates. As the Minister of State is aware, voluntary committees run these swimming pools. They are non profit-making organisations. Were it not for the hard work of all the committees, they would be loss making because they would find it very difficult to keep going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State said he will grant an allowance for the rates where they are community based. That is very important. I would like the Minister of State to confirm that will happen. Where a grant has been paid up to now to meet the rates, perhaps the Minister of State would use his good offices to have a word with local authorities to ensure that the grant continues to be paid even though the local authorities might not be collecting the rates on those swimming pools. Laois, in particular, and Offaly are the most inland counties. We require swimming pool facilities. Swimming is for people of all ages, it is great exercise and very healthy. As the Mini<Col N="909" /> ster of State is in the Department of Finance, his Department and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation should do everything possible to update and upgrade swimming pool facilities</P>

      <P>&ldquo;19.&ndash;(1) Any building or part of a building occupied by a member of either House of the Oireachtas or a representative in the European Parliament which is used exclusively for the purposes of accommodating his or her constituency office and the whole or part of the expenses incurred in maintaining that accommodation are defrayed by that member or representative.</P>

      <P>This arose from Committee Stage. Currently, a Deputy who locates his or her constituency office, that is, his or her secretarial assistance, in the Leinster House Complex is not liable for rates as Leinster House is classified a State occupied property and is therefore exempt from rates. However, if a Deputy locates his or her constituency office outside Leinster House, he or she is liable for rates in respect of the property used as a constituency office. I consider this inequitable and am therefore introducing this amendment to exempt from rates property used exclusively as a constituency office by a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament. Most people do not pay rates, though some do for whatever reason. I think this amendment is fair, the issue was raised by Deputies on all sides and I am happy to make such provision.</P>

It is clear in the case of a Deputy, but for a Senator what constitutes a constituency office? Subsection (2) in the amendment states &ldquo;In this paragraph, &lsquo;constituency office' means an office which is used solely for the provision of representative services by the member of the House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;. Does this include clinics? Is it possible for more than one office in a constituency to be covered? The subsection concludes by stating it &ldquo;does not include the head office of a political party or any other office occupied by a political party&rdquo;. What happens when a regional office of a party is used by a Deputy or Deputies? This applies in Cork where the local regional office is also a constituency office for local Deputies &ndash; this also applies to Fianna Fáil and perhaps to the Labour Party. I also would like to know the date of implementation of this provision.</P>

For example, if a Deputy had a number of offices, as they may have in rural areas, they are covered. However, there had to be a cut off. I am aware of the situation in Cork, but if a building is used by a number of Deputies and also by the party, then it is not included. The provision is specific to Deputies, Senators and members of the European Parliament. It does not include party offices, headquarters or regional centres, even though Deputies may use them as constituency offices.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;19.&ndash;Any shop or retail outlet operated for the purposes of promoting or raising finance for a registered charity.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self explanatory. We debated it on Committee Stage. I understand there are about 100 charity shops in the country owned and run by a variety of different charities. The purpose of charities running shops is to raise money &ndash; if it were otherwise we would not be seeking to exempt them from rates. Since the charities are exempt from almost every other tax, it would be reasonable to extend the principle to shops run for the purposes of a registered charity. On Committee Stage the Minister said this would be unfair in competitive terms in the context of other nearby shops, but there are relatively few examples of charity shops being in direct competition with nearby retail outlets. I am not aware of any, and I would be interested to hear if the Minister is aware of any.</P>

      <P>The Valuation Bill continues the existing exemption from rates of any land, building or any part of a building occupied by a charitable organisation which uses the land or building exclusively for charitable purposes, other than for profit. This means the administrative offices used by a charitable organisation, as well as buildings used directly for charitable relief, are exempt from rates. Buildings used by a charitable organisation for commercial use, such as charity shops, are engaged in a commercial activity for profit, despite the final use to which the profits are put. Therefore, such premises, like other commercial premises, are subject to rates. I fully acknowledge the valuable work undertaken by charities and charity shops and the contribution they make towards the Irish and international community. However, I consider charity shops should not be exempted from rates in the Bill. In this regard, the criteria for rating under the valuation code is based on occupation and the purpose for which the property is used. Charity shops are engaged in a commercial activity for profit, despite the final use to which any profits are put. Charity shops are in direct competition with other shops. Many of them are now selling brand new rather than second-hand goods. Second-hand shops are also subject to rates and such shops are likely to be aggrieved by having their competitors exempted from rates. Applying the criteria of the use to which profits are put as a means of determining whether a premises is subject to rates would create enormous difficulties. Such an approach in valuation legislation would also apply to other activities or outlets that distribute profits or a particular product to charity on a given day or days.</P>
      <P>It should also be recognised that ultimately the effect of removing any category of property from the valuation base would be to increase the rates burden on other ratepayers in the local authority area in which the exempted property is situated. This, in turn, would lead to increased demands for the further exemption of other groups from rates. A number of what could be described as deserving cases argued that their group should be exempted from rates. However, I do not consider that narrowing the rates base further is the way to go and, consequently, I do not propose to exempt from rates such groups, including charity shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I held many lengthy discussions with representatives of all the charities on this issue and there was a fruitful exchange of views on the issues raised. There is an acceptance that this Government in finance Acts over recent years have fundamentally improved the ability of charity organisations to raise substantial sums of money for charity through the tax codes. This was welcomed by those involved in the operation of charitable organisations. I made the point that I would not be prepared to ask other ratepayers to pay rates on behalf of these organisations, which is effectively what would happen. Charity shops are expanding into new, exciting and interesting ways <Col N="913" /> of raising funds directly which does not necessarily include second-hand goods. The removal of rates would further encourage this practice.</P>
    <P>I believe we reached a happy medium in this regard. The charitable organisations believe there are other ways of enhancing their ability to raise and utilise funds and they accepted the Valuation Bill is not a vehicle for addressing specifically such issues. The Government and I fully support and are sympathetic to what these organisations are doing but I am not prepared to use the Valuation Bill as a vehicle for something for which it should not be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State is neither willing nor able to act in regard to this issue. It seems to me that he is over-stating to a considerable degree the effect this measure would have on the valuation base of local authorities. I understand there are approximately 100 charity shops throughout the country, therefore to suggest that other ratepayers would be excessively burdened by taking up the slack in relation to this measure is stretching the point a little bit.</P>
      <P>The point made by Fine Gael Deputies is true. In most cases these charity shops are not in competition with other retail outlets in the immediate vicinity. Perhaps local authorities could be given discretion, as suggested by Deputy Mitchell, to define this measure in a way that would ensure charity shops would not be used to undercut competitors in the immediate vicinity. I am disappointed the Minister of State is not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to come to that point because I had many discussions on this with the people involved. This is a rating matter and, as the Deputy will be aware, new rating legislation is being drafted in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I suggested to the charity organisations that this might be used as a vehicle to enable powers for local authorities to waive rates in full or in part in certain well defined circumstances for charity shops and, possibly, some other groups. I was not being parsimonious in that there may be only 100 such shops. I am well aware of the consequences of changing this in the Bill and what it could potentially be used for in a whole raft of areas. I am not passing the buck because I am quite clear in relation to what I wish to do in the Valuation Bill. However, I suggested to the people involved that perhaps there is a case to be made, as Deputy McDowell has suggested, in the context of the rating authority. It is the only time in the context of this entire Bill that I have made such a suggestion and I am doing so for very specific reasons. I believe the Department of the Environment and Local Government will consider this issue and I have no doubt the charity organisations will discuss the matter with the Department.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I bring the Industrial Design Bill, 2000, before the House today as part of the broader programme of intellectual property law reform which has been ongoing in recent years. Intellectual property rights have become increasingly important to the economy and society in general in recent times. This has been reflected in the increased activity on the legislative front both domestically and internationally in the past decade or so.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that this Bill represents the last leg of the initial programme of reform of primary Irish legislation in this area and, as such, marks a significant milestone in the intellectual property arena in Ireland.</P>
      <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of background I will comment on the context in which intellectual property law in general is framed and operates. It is widely held that intellectual property rights are a key factor in promoting investment in innovative activity in the economy. Innovation is a key element in maintaining the competitive edge for an economy in the face of increasing international competition and economic globalisation. Any hopes of sustaining economic growth in the longer term depend significantly on the ability of the economy to adapt and achieve technical progress. Investment in research and development and the high valuation and prioritisation of innovative activity must be encouraged to give the country a chance to sustain in the longer term current economic well being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intellectual property rights are an essential part of the support and promotion framework which can ensure Irish business continues to invest in and develop innovative creative activity. Further to the Patents Act, 1992, and the Trade Marks Act, 1996, the Government introduced the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, and the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, both of which have significantly advanced the system of rights and remedies for the creators and owners of intellectual property. In addition, with a view to driving competitiveness in the longer term we have established the technology foresight fund, setting aside up to £560 million, or 711 million, over a seven year period for the creation of a critical mass of world class research, initially in biotechnology and information and communications technologies. The Government has, therefore, put its money where its mouth is in terms of promoting innovation and competitiveness in the economy in the past three years. The Bill is further evidence of our continuing <Col N="916" /> commitment to promoting innovation with appropriate support in the law.</P>
    <P>On the industrial design front, Irish designers have received great recognition and had remarkable success, both at home and abroad, for their excellence and individuality. Increasing numbers of Irish textile fashion designers have been at the cutting edge of international design and exhibited around the world to great acclaim. Irish crystal and glassware products are household names throughout the world and the subject of a massive export industry. On the domestic front, the Irish furniture design industry, while always relatively healthy, has blossomed and currently boasts sufficient diversity and excellence to compete successfully with the best of imported material. Our success in this area has been based on quality and to no small degree on Irish culture, witnessed by a strong and vibrant craftwork and traditional handicraft industry that continues to thrive in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also been at the leading edge in modern design, including in the area of graphic design which is so significant in the context of the information society. The excellence and hard work that has gone into these areas must continue to be protected against the potentially devastating effects of plagiarism and the Bill aims to provide the appropriate level of support in the law by providing strong legal remedies and criminal penalties to ensure the necessary level of protection is achieved.</P>
    <P>Industrial designs are, essentially, the appearance of products made by industrial or handicraft means. They include such features of appearance as shape, contours, lines and colours. Examples of familiar designs would be the shape of a coke bottle, the patterns used on wallpapers and carpets and the contours of crystal glassware. If we look around this Chamber, we can see many examples of industrial design in the furniture, carpets and other aesthetic features. The Bill will protect these designs against, for example, the illegal copying of the design, the illegal sale of products incorporating the design and the illegal import or export or other use of a product incorporating the design.</P>
    <P>Industrial design law has been somewhat neglected during the years. The landmark Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, the first comprehensive intellectual property law to be enacted in the State, is still in force in respect of industrial designs. That, in itself, is sufficient reason to revisit this aspect of the law from the point of view of modernisation alone. The adoption of a European Union directive on the legal protection of designs in 1998 also offers both an opportunity and an obligation to overhaul the current legislation and bring this aspect of intellectual property law into the new century.</P>
    <P>Turning to the content of the Bill, let me indicate a few general facts about industrial designs and the law. As I mentioned, it is the appearance of products that is the subject of industrial designs <Col N="917" /> protection, as distinct from the function of the product. To use the Coke bottle again as an example, it is the shape of the bottle that is protected under industrial design law; the function, in this case to hold carbonated minerals, is not protected by the registration of the industrial design. It may be possible that the function could be patentable as an invention and thus protectable under patent law, but that is not a matter for this legislation. It is, therefore, the aesthetic appeal of an industrial design that is protectable under the Bill. As Deputies will appreciate, the appearance of many products can be the decisive factor in determining whether a consumer buys that product or opts instead for a competing product. In this way, a poor design might undermine the commercial potential of a very high quality product. As a result, designers will spend much time and effort, and businesses much money, on achieving the best design possible to apply to their products. This investment of time and money must be rewarded to encourage its continuation.</P>
    <P>The most effective and transparent manner in which to protect industrial designs is through a system of registration. This offers great legal clarity and certainty and also provides a system of accessible and concise information on the existence of rights and the registered rightsholders. The production of evidence of registration greatly assists the designer in moving quickly and decisively to obtain legal redress through, for example, injunction, to prevent the infringement of his or her rights and stop the continuation of such infringement. The existence of a public register also offers the public and other businesses important information on pre-existing rights and the expiry dates of such rights. This is very useful information in future planning and expenditure decisions of both directly competing industries, and industries and businesses which rely on designs to provide the best possible finish to their products.</P>
    <P>As part of the update of existing law, the Bill clarifies the legal position regarding authorship and ownership of industrial designs and provides a clear statement of the rights that attach to the registration of a design under the new law. These provisions offer significant support to the designer in prosecuting and defending his or her rights in civil legal cases. The existing system of law is also amended to allow invalidation actions to be taken before the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, on less restricted grounds than those in the current law. This should prove both useful and practical, as well as cost-efficient, in terms of time and expense for users of industrial designs. The Bill includes new provisions on the restoration of protection of designs that has lapsed despite due diligence in maintaining the registration, and provides an exception which permits prior use of a registered design to be continued in specified circumstances, even after the design has been registered under the new law. Both these provisions will facilitate <Col N="918" /> sensible and reasonable law to operate in practice and assist the smooth transfer to the new regime of protection, particularly for those who have committed time and resources to the exploitation of a design in good faith and subsequently find that they have no right to use the design in question.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates in a clearer, more comprehensive manner the civil and criminal remedies available under the current law and improves them. The civil remedies include access to injunctions, damages and delivery up of infringing copies of designs, but also contain a protection for those who, unaware of the existence of rights in a design, innocently infringe that design right. The Bill proposes strong criminal penalties along the lines of those for the recent copyright legislation. This brings consistency across intellectual property law in this respect and a coherent approach to protection of the various forms of intellectual property.</P>
    <P>One of the principal aims of the Bill is the implementation of the EU directive on the legal protection of designs adopted in 1998. It is important that Ireland implements this directive at the earliest possible date to demonstrate that our recent commitments to bring Irish intellectual property law into line with all international commitments are being met. I have no doubt that the House will assist in the achievement of this objective through constructive, yet efficient, debate. In implementing the directive, the Bill proposes that many of the legal definitions in the directive be directly transposed into our law. This will eliminate any possibility of incorrect or inconsistent application of the directive in Ireland. The Bill also introduces the new novelty and individual character tests, which are fundamental to the directive. The revised novelty test effectively means that, in general, a design must not have been made available to the public within the European Economic Area prior to application for registration in order to qualify for protection. This is a much broader novelty test than that under Irish law and is a significant development in terms of the achievement of a single market within the European Community.</P>
    <P>I would like to take time to make particular mention of the position, under the directive, of industrial designs that constitute spare parts used for the repair of complex products. Member states are obliged to maintain in force their existing laws in this area until a review of the matter is undertaken by the European Commission in consultation with industry. This review is due to be completed and proposals brought forward by the Commission by October 2005 at the latest. Existing Irish law does not make specific provision with respect to spare parts. Therefore, if a design of a spare part meets the criteria for protection under existing Irish law, it shall be protected.</P>
    <P>The terms of the directive include provisions that deny protection of the design of spare parts not visible during normal use of the product. The <Col N="919" /> Bill implements this aspect of EU law. However, because our current Irish law makes no specific provision preventing the registration of spare parts used for the repair of complex products to restore their original appearance, we are relatively constrained in bringing forward changes to prevent the registration of designs of spare parts used for repair purposes in the Bill. I will keep the matter under review and, when the European Commission reaches conclusions and brings forward proposals in this area, the best course of action for Ireland can be decided upon at that time.</P>
    <P>On the international front, the Bill enables the ratification and implementation of the Geneva Act of The Hague Agreement on the International Registration of Industrial Designs. This treaty was concluded in 1999 and provides for the establishment of an international registration system for industrial designs likely to attract large membership among the member states of the World Intellectual Property Organisation and will offer the possibility of protection for Irish designers in many different countries through a single application. I am sure Members have fond memories of the World Intellectual Property Organisation as a result of our deliberations on the copyright legislation. Under current arrangements, Irish designers would have to apply individually to each different country, pay each country a separate fee and, probably, hire local legal expertise to assist in achieving registration in those countries. There are obvious cost and time savings involved in having access to a central, dedicated system that will operate to high standards of performance and process applications more efficiently than the currently available options offer. The Bill will also ensure Ireland's industrial design law is fully compliant with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement, or TRIPS, as it is colloquially known, annexed to the World Trade Organisation agreement. These developments will permit Irish business and citizens to fully participate in the various international systems for protection of industrial designs and to avail of the undoubted benefits they offer.</P>
    <P>In addition to meeting Ireland's international commitments and taking advantage of the international systems of protection, the Bill takes into consideration and reflects the modern environment in which industrial designers operate and the best elements of existing intellectual property law. The language employed is user-friendly and technology-neutral to provide, in as far as is possible, strong protection in this era of information technology, electronic superhighways and band width capability, which facilitates the copying and high-speed transmission of digital and electronic images, including designs, right around the world with the click of a mouse.</P>
    <P>Many of the innovations in the provisions for search and seizure of illegal copies that featured in the recent copyright legislation have been <Col N="920" /> repeated for industrial designs. One in particular that is worth mentioning is the provision that permits the Garda to be accompanied by experts when conducting searches of premises for suspected infringing material. This is a practical measure that businesses can use to protect their legitimate interests in an effective manner. The area of graphic design, which has been growing in importance in recent years, is also covered by the terms of this provision, as are designs that are computer-generated.</P>
    <P>While I am referring to the recent copyright legislation, I should mention that this Bill repeals the technical bar created in the 1927 legislation, which prevented designs that are used or intended to be used on industrial products from obtaining protection under copyright law. Repealing this technical bar offers underlying protection to industrial designs in the event that registration is not achieved or is not desirable. It enables a designer to choose whether, in light of the nature and intended use of the design, copyright law or registration under the Bill is the most effective form of protection for their particular design.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that regulations made under this Bill in the future will facilitate e-business, including electronic payment and, eventually, electronic filing of applications. It is critically important that Irish business and the Irish public have quick, secure and cheap access to information on registered intellectual property rights. Proposals to enable the Patents Office to meet that challenge and to bring the industrial designs registration system into the modern era are currently being prepared and will be developed on a structured basis over time. In practice, this will mean that designers will, in time, be able to apply for registration electronically and to access the designs register on-line via the Internet. At present a person seeking information on registered designs must request the relevant information by post or must visit the Patents Office to physically view the paper-based register of designs. This is most impractical and does not permit electronic searching of the designs database or timely access to information for Patents Office users. This process will need to be reflected in respect of all areas of intellectual property services, in line with the improved access to public services to be provided through the public services broker model recently announced by the Taoiseach. Only then can we say that we have truly implemented e-government in this area of public services.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that, while this Industrial Designs Bill is only one element of the overall ongoing programme of reform of intellectual property law in Ireland, it is, in itself, a very significant step forward. It will have a significant beneficial impact on design industries and craft businesses, which rely heavily on the protection of the law to underpin the substantial investments they make in developing designs. This Bill will also contribute to the modernisation, simplification and user-<Col N="921" /> friendliness of the Irish legal code, as well as enabling Ireland to meet all its EU and international obligations in the industrial designs area.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael support this legislation. I have been looking at legislation for many years but I have never come across a situation where the reading of the explanatory memorandum was more difficult and more confusing than the actual Bill. Perhaps the Minister's Department would consider ensuring that, as far as possible, the explanatory memorandum is just that. The Bill is far more user friendly, consumer friendly and Dáil Deputy friendly than is the explanatory memorandum. I hope that point will be taken on board, particularly in the area of intellectual property which is technical.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us implements the EU directive on the legal protection of designs and will mean that Irish business and designers in future will be bound by an international system of design protection under the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement. The Bill results in our law being considerably modernised, allowing for the expansion of remedies in both the civil and criminal codes which will be available in respect of breaches of design rights. Undoubtedly, this is a welcome move. The Bill implements fully the terms of the EU designs directive and includes the same definitions and language of the directive in so far as it can. It is a complex and technical area.</P>
      <P>As well as complying with the legal requirements of the directive, the Bill extends the protection afforded to design by ten years from 15 to 25 and also extends the protection of copyright to include all registered designs. This is the first time in Irish law that this has happened. When enacted it will allow the owners of these design rights better scope to enforce their ownership by referring matters to the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks or, indeed, through the courts and it also provides a more effective and faster system of registration of designs. The Bill deals with certain rectification procedures and sets out the basis where persons are not entitled to register design rights or to adopt another person's design rights for their own use and benefit.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Designs Bill is one of a number of Bills in the intellectual property area published recently allowing this country to keep pace with international developments and modernisation. It is important to note the important advances made so far as industrial design is concerned and the manner in which many of our designers have kept pace with best international practices over a number of vocations. In the past ten years we have had the Patents Act, 1992, the Trademarks Act, 1996, and implementation of the European directive on trademarks. In 1998 we had the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, with regard to civil copyright cases. Since then the Patents (Amendment) Bill, 1999, has completed Second Stage and is awaiting Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> Over the years we have neglected to update our legislation in this area. Until now the registration of designs in Ireland was governed by the Industrial and Commercial (Property Protection) Act, 1927, which deals with patents, trademarks and designs. The registration of designs in Ireland is still governed by the 1927 Act whereas our near neighbours in the UK have seen considerable modernisation and development in design law. For example, Britain had the Registered Designs Act, 1949, the Design Copyright Act, 1968, and the Copyright Designs and Patents Act, 1988. In the meantime Irish design law has remained largely unchanged.</P>
    <P>Industrial designs are protected by design registration under the 1927 Act or where a design is not capable of registration it may be protected in certain circumstances under the Copyright Act, 1963, amended 14 years ago by the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>This Bill centres around the EU directive on the legal protection of designs adopted by the Council of Ministers in September 1998 and published in October 1998. This came into force on 17 November 1998 at which time it was announced that member states had three years to implement the directive which will expire in October 2001. I am sure it is the Minister's intention to have all Stages of the legislation through both Houses and signed by the President in advance of that date. Fine Gael supports the harmonisation of the law in those areas directly affecting the working of the internal market. The matter of penalties, remedies, sanctions and enforcement will remain in our own hands. I am pleased the Government took an early decision, following the publication of the EU directive in October 1998, to introduce this primary legislation.</P>
    <P>The terms of the directive give rise to certain important changes in our domestic law as outlined in the Bill, for example, the meaning attributed to &ldquo;design&rdquo;, the criteria for registration and the meaning of this registration, the introduction of a &ldquo;must fit&rdquo; exclusion from registerability, the introduction for the first time of a grace period and the extension of the period of exclusivity available.</P>
    <P>Part 1 deals with design registration and it is no surprise to learn that the design must have features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament. This is a new definition in the Bill which states: &ldquo;&ldquo;design&rdquo; means the appearance of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines, contours, colour, shape, texture or materials of the product itself or its ornamentation.&rdquo;  The shape or pattern must be applied to an article as under Irish design, registration is based on the specified article and there is no protection for a shape which is considered abstract or a pattern which is not obvious from the article. The shape or pattern must be applied in all cases to a specific and particular article. This is a practical effect when deal<Col N="923" /> ing with the first registration or when determining a breach.</P>
    <P>In Britain there is an exemption from registration when dealing with articles of an artistic or literary nature. In Ireland design works or sculpture works may be accepted for registration. Perhaps the Minister of State could comment on the exemption from registration or otherwise in respect of articles of a literary or artistic nature. On application for registration the new design must be one not previously published in the State and the matter of novelty is considered of great importance. In other jurisdictions there have been difficulties in deciding what is new and original and it seems the test, that is applied in order to consider novelty, is that an original should be interpreted as referring to a design no previous designer had created for any purposes, and a new article would be in reference to a design which was not in this sense original but was new in so far as it was the first time it was the subject matter of an application.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the design which is new and has individual character shall be capable of being registered and the criteria for such registration are contained in sections 12 and 13. The Bill includes provisions which will be subject to inspection by the registrar and subject to obtaining copies of documents. It appears no inspection can take place until after registration has been completed while section 24 provides that the design shall be classified. Section 40 provides that the Patents Office shall provide details on registered designs on request, accompanied by information, to enable the controller to identify that design.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister of State refer to the Patents Office going on-line, which is a marvellous achievement to which I look forward. It is one of those offices that conjures up images of Dickensian cobwebbed rooms full of paper. It is closely associated in my mind with such august offices as the Registry of Deeds and, until lately, the Companies Office. The on-line facility should be available to all public offices. The situation in the Companies Office remains somewhat unsatisfactory regarding filing documents and returns &ndash; the normal form-filling procedures of that office. It is the bread and butter of the Companies Office but the fact that most of those activities are not available electronically is a source of concern to businesses and particularly small to medium-sized enterprises. Matters should be progressed along the lines suggested by a recent statement from the Taoiseach. I hope the Patents Office and the Registry of Deeds follow suit.</P>
    <P>The existence of the registration of a class in which a design might be registered can also be discovered by way of application to the controller. The procedure for registration, I understand, takes some time to secure and I hope this can be dealt with positively following the passage of the legislation. There appears to be an undue time <Col N="924" /> lapse in terms of waiting for registration and presumably if modern technology were applied the delay would be considerably shorter.</P>
    <P>The design is registered for an initial period of five years and may be renewed thereafter and the maximum time under the Bill is for 25 years, an extension from the present ten years for registration of design articles. I note that packaging designs and get-ups as well as type faces will be considered for registration as will the design of a part of a complex product, provided that the criteria are met for registration and provided that the part design remains visible during normal use which, under the legislation, means &ldquo;use by the end user&rdquo; excluding servicing, repair or maintenance. The Minister of State made a passing reference to the situation regarding motor car components and spare parts. This area is a source of some uncertainty and will be considered in some detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with individual character is important in so far as a design must have individual character and would have to be deemed to have the character by the informed user. It must convey a different overall impression than any of the design available to the public before the filing or priority date. When deciding on whether individual character is present the degree of freedom of the designer has to be considered.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been welcomed, by and large, by experts in this field. There was a seminar considering the matter in some detail some months ago which the Minister of State attended. There were submissions from experts, such as European patent attorney, Mr. Peter Short, and Ms. Yvonne McKeown from McLoughlin and Donaldson, who made some interesting comments following the immediate publication of the Bill last year. I understand the Bill has also been welcomed by the Copyright Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was a particular reference to the introduction for the first time of a grace period in Article 6 of the European directive. This article provides that activities of exhibition and publication or other disclosure will constitute the making of the design available to the public, unless such activities could not reasonably have become known in the normal course of business to those specialising in the sector concerned prior to the filing date. Practitioners will have noted that this will cause not only some difficulty but some legal uncertainty and I trust the Minister of State will clarify this in the course of his reply or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In section 2 of Article 6, there applies a grace period of one year in respect of disclosures made by the designer or that person's successor in title or a third party as a result of information provided or action taken by the designer. Thus comments such as disclosures made in the 12 months before the filing or priority date will not deprive the design of one of its most fundamental aspects of registration, the matter of novelty. The provision of a grace period is new and something practitioners will take some time to embrace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Practitioners have welcomed the duration of protection which has been increased from a current maximum of 15 years to a maximum of 25 years from filing applicable in blocks of five year periods. The extension of the period of protection under Article 10, section 43 is welcome. There may be a problem in so far as the provision that allows for the deferment of publication of design is concerned. It has been suggested that this period should not be 30 months, as envisaged in the legislation, but perhaps 18 months, which would mean a certain harmony with the period as in the patents legislation. A period of 30 months is considered too long and perhaps for consistency 18 months should be considered.</P>
    <P>As well as design being defined in the Act, so too is product, as &ldquo;any industrial or handicraft item, including parts intended to be assembled into a complex product, packaging, get-up, graphic symbols and typographical typefaces, but not including computer programmes&rdquo;. It is clear that the definition is broader than that of article, which is also contained in the Bill and to which I referred earlier and which will allow for the registration of designs for articles which have no function other than to carry the design. Designs for packaging, get-up and graphic symbols will be registrable, therefore, for the first time.</P>
    <P>It is clear that designs for typographical typefaces will be registrable for the first time and the definition also includes items such as motor car parts for assembly into a &ldquo;complex product&rdquo;, a product composed of multiple components which can be replaced. I referred earlier to the difficulties we may have regarding clarification of car components and spare parts.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Bill, although the Minister may correct me, that computer programmes are excluded as products because the Government is anxious to avoid confusion between this directive and the computer programme protection directive. Any overlap could give rise to confusion, yet the Minister referred in his speech to the fact that this legislation covers electronic filing. I am not sure of the extent to which we have incorporated a body of legislation to deal with the directive on computer programme protection. I do not recall legislation being passed, or being before the House, so I am not sure where the application of that directive to Irish law stands. I ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>The directive sees significant changes in Irish law as far as novelty is concerned. For the first time, we have introduced the concept of universal novelty, whereas under current law only local novelty is required. There is also a subjective test as prior art must be shown to have become known to the relevant industrial sector within the European Union; otherwise the requirement of novelty in individual character does not appear to depart significantly from our local test as to similarity applied under existing law.</P>
    <P>The directive does not require examination, and it is questionable whether the novelty examination carried out by the Irish Patent Office for <Col N="926" /> prior Irish designs would be worthwhile in the context of this new universal or international novelty. I understand the European office that will deal with design registration will be based in Alicante and I wonder if there will be an Irish representative. What will be the relationship between the European office in Spain and the Irish Patent Office? Will Ireland have a representative on the international inspectorate? What will be the changed role and function of the Dublin office?</P>
    <P>The directive does not include provisions on ownership but these are included in the Bill in sections 17 to 19. The Bill identifies the author of a design as the person who creates it or makes the arrangements necessary for its creation. Section 19 states that the author is &ldquo;the first proprietor of the design unless the design is created by an employee in the course of employment, in which case the employer is the first proprietor of the design, subject to any agreement to the contrary&rdquo;. Such an agreement may be between an employer and an employee, third party, agent or client. The author, if not the first proprietor, has the right to be named as the author in the application for registration.</P>
    <P>It is provided that the scope of protection conferred by a design right shall include any design which does not convey on the informed user a different overall impression. A design registered in a member state shall also be eligible for protection under the law of copyright of that State, from the date on which the design was created in any form. It seems that a cumulative protection by design registration and by copyright must be provided. If so, it is necessary to delete from Irish law the current prohibition on such cumulative protection and to regulate the protection to be given by copyright. The directive contains other provisions relating to invalidity or refusal of registration and rights conferred by registered design and imitation of rights.</P>
    <P>We will have to consider some aspects of the Bill in detail on Committee Stage. I refer particularly to matters that might arise, for example as regards the &ldquo;must fit&rdquo; exception with particular reference to spare parts in the motor industry and the repair exception. The directive makes clear certain matters which will render a registration invalid, in particular if it is lacking novelty or is functional, immoral or contrary to public policy, registered by a non-proprietor or a party who cannot establish a bona fide interest, conflicting with an earlier registration or deemed never to have given rise to any rights.</P>
    <P>A considerable section of the Bill deals with reliefs available to injured parties or parties that may be offended by a registration. The three remedies available in such instances are injunction, presumably to stop all registration that may be adverse to the interests of the person involved, the seizure of the goods that gave rise to the problem in the first instance and an application to the court for damages as a civil remedy. I note that the court mentioned in section 62 for an <Col N="927" /> application for the seizure of infringing products or articles is the District Court and I am somewhat surprised as I find it a little difficult to comprehend that this is an area of speciality of District Courts. While there may not be a flood of applications from persons who allege extensive breaches of the Industrial Designs Bill and are seeking the seizure of goods, one would imagine that a District Court's expertise in this area would be somewhat limited.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the role of the Garda Síochána when conducting an examination, investigation or search and it is important that gardaí are sufficiently competent in this area. To allay fears we may have in that regard, the Minister said there will be experts, I presume a panel of them, available to accompany the Garda. I assume the experts will advise the local District Court on the nature of the infringement or on the damage that may have been caused. Who will be on the panel of experts? Where will they come from? How many persons does the Minister envisage as sufficient to operate as a team? What evidence will be required of them to fulfil their duties?</P>
    <P>The overlap between design registration and copyright and the extent to which designs may be protected by copyright is complex and specialist. When these matters are before the courts, in particular the District Court, I hope the appropriate level of speciality and expertise will be available. The Hague Agreement on the international deposit of designs provides for a single design registration covering a multiplicity of States. Since 1925, only 19 states, excluding Ireland, have adhered to the treaty. Under the Industrial Designs Bill, 2000, it will be possible for Ireland to adhere to the new Hague Agreement and ratify the treaty, which will contribute to the harmonisation of design law through the EU in accordance with commitments already given.</P>
    <P>As the legislation must be enshrined in Irish law by a particular date in October, and taking into account that there are nine weeks left in the current session, Fine Gael will co-operate fully with the passage of the legislation. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, for his opening comments. No doubt his officials will be available to Members of the House to attempt to iron out some of the difficult technical language in the Bill. I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage following completion of Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, for his introductory speech which spells out the background, purpose and significance of this legislation. Deputy Flanagan has taken time out to trace in some detail the complexity of this Bill and I do not propose to follow suit. I cannot improve on his explanation of the terms of the Bill because, above all, this is a hugely technical Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of intellectual property is quite complex. I cannot disagree with the Minister of <Col N="928" /> State's fundamental proposition that intellectual property is now a key factor in promoting investment and innovative activity in the economy. That is manifestly true. This Bill is an aspect of that. It is, I suppose, in the overall programme of intellectual property reform, a minor, but nonetheless important, aspect.</P>
    <P>From my time in Government and in Opposition, I am familiar with that broader programme of intellectual property reform. I introduced the Trade Marks Bill, 1995, and I have sat opposite the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, in debates on a couple of the more recent Bills put through the House. I do not know if there is any point in coursing again the philosophy which we dealt with in more detail in the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, in particular, save to say that nowadays there is not really a great deal of freedom open to an Irish Government in this matter. We are members of the Single Market, which determines, whether by way of international treaty or adherence to a particular EU directive, the parameters of intellectual property law in Ireland. As a result we have had the experience on several occasions of dealing with amendments, which in the Irish context may even have recommended themselves to the Minister as being sensible or tailor made for the Irish situation, but which the Minister found he could accept because of something set out, for instance, in the TRIPs Agreement or the Hague Agreement. In that sense the broad parameters are pretty much laid down and this Bill is following on the EU directive.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Department on being ahead of itself. It is a little unusual to be here at this stage of the legislative process in advance of the date set out for implementation of a EU directive. I do not know the extent of the backlog of primary legislation in the Department related to European law, not to mention secondary legislation, but I would imagine the Department is ahead of itself here. Probably that says something about the growing importance attached to the programme of reform of intellectual property law in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Having said all of that, I did not ever see this issue of design primarily in the realm of intellectual property law. I see it in the context of industrial policy. It is an important aspect of innovation and I do not think we have been good at it. In the modern world in which we function in terms of commercial practices, the permeation of television and consumer habits, the attractiveness of design, packaging, etc., is critical. Design is only one small aspect of innovation. When we talk about innovation, which is absolutely central in maintaining a competitive edge for this economy in all of its aspects, in the past we have not given it the attention it deserved.</P>
    <P>On the question of industrial strategy, the extraordinary boom over the past six or seven years to some extent conceals a certain endemic weakness which still exists in the indigenous sector. Of this year's two shocks, the foot and mouth <Col N="929" /> disease scare and the American economic slowdown, it is the American economic slowdown which poses the greatest threat to this economy. So much of our growth is being driven by the large international companies based here that agriculture is not as significant as it once was. The foot and mouth disease scare impacts on other industries, especially tourism, but it is a shock which we can survive and overcome. If there was to be a serious downturn in the United States it would have quickly a serious impact on employment here. Therefore there is a necessity to maintain the focus on developing a strong indigenous sector in this economy. Whereas we have made progress and considerable strides in recent years, there are still weaknesses and there is still inadequate attention given to innovation, and this matter of design is but one important aspect of that necessary innovation.</P>
    <P>If one looks back over the years, we have been weak in this area. One should remember the efforts, such as they were, to try to create a design conscious environment in Ireland. CTT was the only agency, in my judgment, which tried to give any profile to this issue. I am not sure what is the position today. I am not that close to it. I do not know how the absorption of An Bord Tráchtála impacted on the Department, which is now huge.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any Minister has the time to focus on that aspect of it to drive it to the extent it is desirable. Enterprise Ireland is also an enormous conglomerate. I wonder was it a happy and desirable merger? CTT tried to give some profile to this issue with some success.</P>
    <P>To take the example of the Kilkenny Design shop, the idea was to import Swedes to guide us on the importance of this area and that achieved some success, but unfortunately through inadequate resourcing and other neglect the workshops effectively crumbled and we are left with KKD, which is dedicated to good producer design for the top of the market. It was a pity the design workshops crumbled for the want of assistance in grant aid, resources and so on.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister of State, when replying, could contradict me on the point I am about to make. He said on the industrial design fronts, Irish designers have received great recognition and they have had remarkable success at home and abroad for their excellence and individuality. I am not sure to what he is referring. It seems to be a complacent position. Will he give some instances of this striking impact we have made abroad? We have had an impact to some extent in the textile area. I am not so sure about Waterford Crystal. We have not made a major international impact in the design area. It is not easy to do so. To take the example of the Coke bottle used by the Minister of State, a great deal of money went into us all being able to recognise it across the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It is a difficult and expensive issue. In terms of considering industrial policy, I am not sure design is an aspect that has attracted the focus and priority it deserves. I welcome this Bill in the sense that it brings forward this issue. The Minister of State said it is true that industrial design law has been neglected over the years. That bears out my point. The landmark 1927 Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act, the first comprehensive intellectual property Bill to be enacted in the State is still in force in respect of industrial designs. The year 1927 is a long time ago, a year after momentous events in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's life. For the Minister to say it is true that industrial design law has been somewhat neglected over the years is a euphemistic statement. A great deal of water has gone under the bridge since 1927. Industrial policy has evolved dramatically since 1927, the era of protectionism and so on, into the current Single Market, global market conditions and so on. That 1927 law remains the law of the land, which points to design not having attracted the same attention from the policy makers as other aspects of industrial policy.</P>
      <P>This issue is part of the weakness of our indigenous sector. I am glad the law, as distinct from design practice, is being modernised and I welcome the protections the Minister of State has introduced in the Bill. I have not had too many lobbyists come to my door about this Bill, although Deputy Flanagan, who took great care to course the Bill in some detail, may have had. I am not aware of any rising up among those in the design industry to make their case. I do not know if they have been making their case to the Minister of State. That also tells a tale. I would have thought an organisation such as IBEC would have someone skilled in promoting this aspect. If it does, I am not aware of it. It certainly has not made any representations to my knowledge to this side of the House on the matter. It is important enough to require that kind of attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State might indicate if he has had discussions with IBEC about the essence of the Bill and what is its view, as I would be interested to know that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the Minister of State's glancing reference to the Patents Office going on line and being available and better capable of coping with the additional functions we have imposed on it on a few occasions in recent times. I would have thought the additional burden on the Patents Office would be pretty extensive and I was glad to hear the remarks the Minister of State made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan said there is no reason we could not do what we did to the Companies Registration Office and that is right. I take some credit for the modernisation of that office in <Col N="931" /> terms of investment decisions I made in IT and other changes including the purchase of a premises when I was on the Minister's side of the House.</P>
    <P>I am aware of an extraordinary court decision that effectively prevents the Companies Registration Office from providing the kind of service Deputy Flanagan said would be desirable. My understanding is that a private company brought an action to the court and, to the surprise of many people, was successful, as a result of which the Companies Registration Office is disbarred from providing a service on line to the public that it might otherwise provide. I understand the Minister is appealing that, but I do not know why the matter is not winding its way more speedily through the system, as it is important it should be disposed of. That service should be available on line to people in 2001. Nobody can claim to have a superior right to mediate this information to the public as a commercial proposition. Is the Minister of State aware of the status of that appeal and if it is being pressed with any urgency because it is important, as Deputy Flanagan's analogy is fair enough.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Bill, subject to closer scrutiny on Committee Stage, seem to stick pretty rigidly, in terms of definitions and interpretation, to EU directives and other than that I presume it has to conform to the relevant international agreements and treaties to ensure that the TRIPS agreement is fully implemented in Ireland. It is probably fair enough to grant design rights lasting up to 25 years to proprietors of registered designs, although I understand that the duration of copyright is life plus 70 years. The people who own the design rights would have the exclusive right to use the relevant design and to prevent its being copied or sold by others.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our international obligations, I am not sure that this Bill lends itself to much amendment on Committee Stage, other than scrutiny of the import of various sections. It is not a Bill that is likely to be subject to lobbying by special interests, as was the case with the Copyright Bill. It is not even like the Trademarks Act, where people whose daily living was affected by the changes being made, made sure that their point of view was registered with the legislators. So far, I have had little contact about this Bill and I doubt if that situation will change. I see this Bill as a technical and very detailed but timely Bill, on an aspect of intellectual property which is probably the poor relation of copyright, patents and trademarks but is nonetheless important in itself.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan's remark about the explanatory memorandum. This issue has arisen twice previously with the Department which the Minister of State represents. I know that the Bill emerges from the parliamentary counsel's office and is signed off by the Minister, but where does the explanatory memorandum <Col N="932" /> come from? Does it also come from the parliamentary counsel's office or is it a departmental product? If it comes from the draftsman's office, the Minister should direct that his officials would have a greater involvement. Surely the purpose ought to be to explain the concept to us, rather than merely regurgitating, in some cases almost verbatim, the contents of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having an explanatory memorandum if it simply repeats the wording of a particular section, rather than explaining, in plain English, the essence of the point being made. Anybody looking for the letter of the law will find it in the Bill, as we do in considerable detail on Committee Stage. This was quite a contentious issue on a previous Bill, which one I cannot recall, within the lifetime of this Dáil. Perhaps it is understandable for people in the parliamentary counsel's office, who have put the Bill together, to repeat it in shorthand fashion in the memorandum. However, for legislators who are the common or garden product of the wishes of the people at election time, it would be of great help if it were communicated to us in terms of the essence of the case being made.</P>
    <P>I do not know, at this stage, the likely implications of such matters as the new novelty test. Does that make it more difficult, or easier, for people to register designs? I am unclear on the reference to Alicante. If an Irish designer wishes to register a design on a piece of glass or a garment, does registration with the controller in Kilkenny, give property rights to the designer in a European Union context? Is that the situation already, or are we working towards that? Does one have to go to Germany to register separately if one is doing business in the German market? There are a number of questions of that nature which, no doubt, we will have an opportunity to discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as continuing the programme of reform of intellectual property law. Broadly, the Labour Party will support it on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the Bill. I agree with the comments of Deputies Flanagan and Rabbitte about the explanatory memorandum accompanying it. As a new Deputy, it had occurred to me to raise the issue on previous Bills. I agree that what is needed is a simple explanation in layman's language, so that we clearly understand the intentions of the Bill and its contents.</P>
      <P>With regard to the present Bill, it is necessary to go through what the Minister said to get a total grasp of what is intended and the various reforms which are proposed. Because it is a particularly technical Bill, many of the finer issues can best be teased out on Committee Stage. Generally speaking, I hope that the introduction of the Bill will emphasise the fact that there is an interest in intellectual property rights. This is a serious issue for the design industry in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> I understand the points being made in relation to the American economy and the involvement of quite a number of industrial names in this country. We are now firmly establishing a greater part of our economy on the industrial base of America and on the information communication technology revolution, which is ongoing, although recent American stock market reports indicate that it is going through a rocky period. However, with software developments and the demand for innovations in that field, I have no doubt that we will see an upsurge in that market again.</P>
    <P>In view of that reliance on the American economy and on the Irish operations of American-based companies, the only thing which makes us in any way different in this field is in the area of innovation and design. That is what makes us different from the American or European experience in this area. Our ethos and culture lend themselves to design and quite a number of Irish people have made their mark on global markets due to their ability to innovate and design. They are not only in the textile area but in furniture production and design, glass design and many other areas. They are also in website and software design which is a huge market. Irish people have played a major part in that area, not just in the American and European markets but globally. These are the people at the cutting edge of development of design and innovation.</P>
    <P>They have been fumbling around in terms of the law and how we offer protection for them. We have not offered sufficient protection to them in the marketplace. Anyone involved in global markets in the area of design will understand that a design is no sooner produced or an innovation put on the market than they are reproduced or stolen or hijacked. I welcome this Bill. It is time this was brought forward and I note in the Minister's contribution that the current law on industrial design dates primarily from 1927. It is well due a serious overhaul. It is possibly the oldest legislation since the foundation of the State to survive on the Statute Book. For that reason and because of the revolution in the economy in recent years and in terms of the sound economic base we are building at home and abroad it is certainly necessary for this legislation to be updated. Many things have happened since 1927 but that legislation seems to have survived world wars, the fall of the Berlin Wall and all sorts of economic changes all over the world.</P>
    <P>This new Industrial Designs Bill, 2000, is therefore required to reflect the current state of technological development in society and to provide a modern system of protection for creators of industrial designs. We must also be conscious of the need to revive excellence in public services and to facilitate businesses that wish to carry out their transactions electronically in this information society era which is, regardless of recent economic stumbling, an ongoing positive development.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to Kilkenny Design and I am delighted as I am from the Carlow-Kilkenny <Col N="934" /> constituency. I am also pleased because Kilkenny has become synonymous with design. Design itself, in European terms has become synonymous with what is happening in Kilkenny. It is true that there has been significant change in the Kilkenny Design workshops. There has been a change in ownership and Kilkenny Civic Trust now own the workshops but that does not mean that the effort in design, production and innovation are not continuing to take place. The courtyard in the workshop in Kilkenny is now full of people interested in various activities such as pottery, jewellery, furniture, etc., and a craft council of Ireland is involved there showing off Irish design and designers. That is crucial to the economic base of this country because of the fact that we have led the European scene in terms of design. There is a global market for the design centre and its product and it is recognised and profiled abroad.</P>
    <P>Textile, furniture and pottery design have been mentioned. History books show that a Callan, Kilkenny, man was associated with Coke and a Kilkenny man was associated with the architectural design of various buildings, including the White House. Design in our culture goes back to early years and Irish design, Celtic or modern, is recognised. Despite the fact that we focus on information and communication technology, an important role is being played in building a sound economic platform by design and manufacture and it is time we introduced this legislation to protect what is happening.</P>
    <P>Waterford Crystal is just one company involved in the general production of glass and the quality of its designs is recognised world-wide. Other glass companies would also have an interest in this Bill. They are now creating new designs in glass and establishing small indigenous companies assisted by county enterprise boards and other agencies of the State. They are doing quite well and also recognised abroad. People come here to see and experience the design capabilities of these companies. I do not doubt that if these companies were made aware of this Bill they would have a strong input to it on Committee Stage. The Bill should be widely publicised because these people have been asking for this type of legislation and now it is being delivered.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the area of software design and it deserves particular attention. Young Irish designers have made a name for themselves world-wide regarding how quickly they caught on to information technology. Quite a number of smaller companies are now actively promoting Irish design in the global market, thus ensuring a strong profile for this country as a technology based economy. Because so many things are happening in the area of design and technology it is extremely important that this Government through legislation would offer them necessary protection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked for some examples of our design abroad. Through travel one will experience at first-hand the numbers of compan<Col N="935" /> ies that have made a name for themselves in the global market in software design. There are also other areas such as furniture design. Other smaller companies have accessed major markets and employ a small number of people in their Irish based operations. Their success is based on the fact that they have captured innovation and design. In furniture design, for example in Kilkenny, they have cut out a niche market for themselves but their success is based on design.</P>
    <P>Recently at the Enterprise and Small Business Committee we had a number of people discussing the issue of patents. They wanted to ensure that their design or product was protected. I believe, despite what Deputy Rabbitte said, that there is a very strong economic involvement by designers and there is an interest in this Bill which does offer protection. The clothing design industry is another sector which will look at this Bill positively.</P>
    <P>Much legislation is required to facilitate e-business and e-government, none more so than in industrial regulation where costs to business are involved. This Bill will eventually provide business and the public with quick, secure and cheap access to information on registered intellectual property rights. Proposals to meet that challenge and to bring the industrial design registration system into the modern era must be developed. Today, a person should be able to access the design registers <i>via</i> the Internet. The companies which use the Internet, not just as a marketing tool but to inform and communicate, want to access all information on line. By doing that, as a Government, we are participating in this revolution, by placing information on line and so encouraging others to use it. People should be able to conduct their business with the State in the most efficient, cost effective manner. This involves the new technology of which I speak.</P>
    <P>There are reviews on economic progress and the boom seems set to continue. This happened recently but the foundations were laid long before. There is the possibility to create a society capable of standing on its own feet and playing its part on the world stage. Last year, Ireland achieved the honour of obtaining a seat on the United Nations Security Council. This is the best time to increase our international profile and to demonstrate our commitment to international co-operation, as much in intellectual property rights as in security and other forms of international relations.</P>
    <P>This Bill brings us into line with our EU commitments and places us at the forefront of international protection of industrial designs. It strengthens this protection by bringing it up to the standard of the EU directive and even goes beyond it in protecting the interests of Irish designers, industry and citizens. The broad range of strong criminal remedies and penalties ensures that innovation and creativity in industrial design will be encouraged and protected. The companies involved in this field, playing a major role in <Col N="936" /> global markets, welcome this Bill and the legal measures.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the first member states to introduce such measures and is setting an example for our EU partners, underlining our commitment to the single market. I applaud the Minister for this. The Nice Treaty, the growth of the EU markets and the expansion East will provide us with the type of challenges that we encountered when we joined the EU. We quickly competed with many of the leading European economies and now we are a leading one. When that competition occurs, many measures will operate regarding innovation and design. It is important as a small European country for us to show our partners that we are willing to play our role in protecting intellectual property rights and in implementing EU directives. In the long-term, with EU enlargement, we must give the lead in this area. We must show that we are good Europeans, which we have proved, and protect the markets that we generated through our design ethos and niche marketing.</P>
    <P>This Bill facilitates access for Irish designers and owners of intellectual property rights to the Geneva Act system under the Hague Agreement, on the international registration of industrial designs. This is further evidence of our commitment to participate fully in the protection in the intellectual property community and the organisations concerned with this. The new Hague system will permit Irish rights owners to access, in a cheap and effective manner, protection for designs in over 150 countries by a single application to an international designs office in Geneva. Ratification of this will place Ireland at the forefront of states committed to co-operation on implementation of an international treaty. This is to be commended and relates to EU expansion. It will be essential to all involved in international manufacture and design, requiring this protection, to do so at a stroke. They will be protected in many European markets and comforted in knowing that our Government, in this legislation and others to follow, realises their needs and concerns. The most important outcome from a business, competitive perspective of this legislation must be a system which is easy to access, inexpensive and is as user friendly as possible. This legislation moves towards that. I acknowledge the Bill's importance and hope that on Committee Stage we can tease out the technical points. It will be welcomed by those involved in the design industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which updates legislation from 1927 and is overdue. From its 89 sections, and my experience with the previous copyright Bill, I know the Minister devoted much time to both Bills. Good design in business can be the difference between profit and loss. This Bill, as previous speakers stated, is complex, but it must also be user friendly. I appeal to the Minister to provide a booklet to small businesses to explain how the Bill can be availed of. People <Col N="937" /> outside the House may find it difficult to understand how to comply with and avail of it.</P>
      <P>There are many references in this Bill to the role of the controller. Under this legislation he will now be empowered, but will he have additional staff to enable him to implement and promote this Bill? Once this legislation is put through the House and becomes law, it will be necessary to make people within the industry aware that it is in place. It is very important that the Government should clearly promote awareness of this legislation, a Bill consisting of 89 sections, the purpose of which is to implement the EU Design Directive 98/71/EC, which must be implemented by October 2001.</P>
      <P>While it is important to incorporate EU directives in our legislation, this Industrial Design Bill is particularly important, given the huge amount of pirating in every sector. It will help to facilitate the creation of jobs and safeguard innovators in terms of their investments in products in terms of research and money. The foot and mouth crisis is an example of investments being undermined by smuggling, inadequate Border controls and other abuses. I am certain that the investments of many people in industry have been undermined because a concept they have come up with has been pirated and their idea stolen. This Bill will prevent that happening in future.</P>
      <P>An article in <i>Business and Finance</i> states:</P>
      <P>Irish design continues to suffer from fragmentation and a lack of cohesion with a large number of firms employing less than 12 people. There is a poor export sales records from Irish firms reluctant to pool resources in order to secure large-scale contracts.</P>
      <P>That is an area that we should look at in the context of employing companies for design, because it can be very difficult for small companies to employ a designer because of the cost. The article continues:</P>
      <P>These serious issues are being addressed by four main sectoral organisations. A partnership called Design Ireland, based at the UCD campus, is to be launched in January. [I presume that has already been launched]. This is a not-for-profit initiative aimed at more effectively marketing Irish design abroad.</P>
      <P>We all know of the larger companies such as Waterford Glass. However, Irish companies have a great reputation abroad and there is huge potential for small companies who employ fewer than ten or 12 people, who definitely could not employ a design company. The article further states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to a report published by Enterprise Ireland in May of 1999, product design accounted for just two per cent of the sector's overall income in 1997. Visual communications, which includes advertising, graphic design and multimedia development, represented by far the biggest category, with 78 per cent of total income, while environmental <Col N="938" /> design, which includes architecture, interior design and stage design, accounted for 20 per cent . . . mention of the words &lsquo;Irish' and &lsquo;designer' in the same sentence summons up figures from the fashion world like Paul Costello, John Rocha, Philip Tracey or Lainey Keogh.</P>
    <P>Our best example of this is Kerry Co-op and the Kerry brand in relation to food. Kerry Foods is a very important international trade name. In the context of marketing Irish beef abroad, the concept of a good name would clearly identify the product as being Irish. That is where Kerry has been so successful. In the future, it will be important to have a good name not just in relation to food, and to clearly establish that name to ensure that what is manufactured in Ireland stands for something. We must invest in that.</P>
    <P>The article further states:</P>
    <P>Awareness of the importance of design in the production of everyday goods has been historically very low in this country. This is, in part, linked with the absence of a tradition of widespread indigenous manufacturing.</P>
    <P>The roots of the Irish Design Centre can in part be traced back to a Government-backed study in the 1960s . . . This fed into the creation of the Kilkenny Design organisation . . . But the Irish design sector has remained relatively underdeveloped, with, overall, a poor export sales record, despite notable international successes . . .</P>
    <P>The most comprehensive source document on the industry remains a study conducted by PriceWaterhouseCoopers . . . in 1999. This sector comprises a relatively large number of small companies, employing 12 people or less. According to the report, product design accounted for just two per cent of the sector's overall income in 1997 . . .</P>
    <P>The PriceWaterhouseCoopers report has set the agenda for the development of the industry, which has suffered from fragmentation and lack of cohesion. Up to now, its investment by international design businesses has compounded this. The result, according to the report, is that Irish design &ldquo;does not have a clear and distinctive selling proposition or image&rdquo; and design firms &ldquo;do not pool their resources in order to compete for large-scale design assignments requiring composite design delivery capabilities&rdquo;. Current policy is aimed at reversing these shortcomings.</P>
    <P>This very important Bill will safeguard design, and the Minister's office is working on raising awareness of it.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>As a direct response to the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report, the design sector is itself gearing up to the market itself in a more proactive fashion. The four main sectoral organisations, the Graphic Design Business Associ<Col N="939" /> ation, the Institute of Designers in Ireland (IDI), the Institute of Creative Designers and Advertising and the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland have teamed up to form a design coalition that will be marketed nationally and internationally as Design Ireland. The organisation has representation from the education, business and the public sectors. A not-for-profit company, through which much of the work of Design Ireland will be channelled, has already been established at UCD's campus innovation centre and it is currently recruiting a chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this company be very focused and available through Enterprise Ireland. This is a very good concept. The enterprise boards in each county deal with very small companies. The Minister considers, in the context of marketing and design, facilitating small companies in linking into the facilities of this new forum. The difference between profit and loss is in good design.</P>
    <P>The article also states:</P>
    <P>Design can no longer be seen . . . as some kind of pleasing add-on, but a key enabler. As more and more goods become commoditised through technology and globalisation, brand identity and design become increasingly important differentiators.</P>
    <P>Some Irish companies have scored notable successes on the European stage, the most recent being a stove designed for a French company which has been very successful.</P>
    <P>The article goes on:</P>
    <P>The area of industrial design, in particular, has potential for further growth, given its current low base and its importance as an embedded asset supporting national competitiveness. &ldquo;part of the awareness campaign is to let Irish manufacturers know that they're sitting on the same land mass as some people who are world class,&rdquo; said George Kelly.</P>
    <P>We have a huge potential here.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory provisions governing design date back to 1927. For the first time, this Bill will criminalise infringement of design rights and provide for very heavy fines. That is very important. This should be very effective as a deterrent to those who might consider infringing the rights of others and give substantial recompense for such unlawful acts. The message is being sent out &ndash; I am glad the Bill is doing that &ndash; to infringers, pirates and those who blatantly exploit the people who provide innovation that there will be a heavy price to pay for such activity and that the Government will not put up with this fraudulent and harmful activity. I have great respect for people who work hard and invest in an idea and somebody else should not exploit their idea.</P>
    <P>This new law will not be retrospective and so any existing protection will be unaffected and any <Col N="940" /> pending applications, subject to certain conditions, can opt to be considered under either the old or the new law. Can people opt for the old or the new law on an application? The aim of the legislation is to modernise Irish industrial design law to broaden the civil and criminal remedies available in respect of infringements of design rights and to enable future access for Irish designers and business to an international system of design protection.</P>
    <P>It is essential to understand what is covered by the term &ldquo;design&rdquo;. It means the appearance of the whole or part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines, contours, colour, shape, texture and materials of the product itself or its ornamentation. It is important that all this is made quite simple. A design must be new in that no identical design has previously been made available to the public prior to the date of registration, otherwise known as the priority date.</P>
    <P>Public exposure is not established if exposure is made without the owner's authorisation in breach of the confidentiality agreement or within 12 months of the date on which the design was filed. There are also exceptions regarding display at certain official or international exhibitions. The design must also have individual character which means that it produces a different overall impression on the end user.</P>
    <P>It is also said that the creator of a design is deemed to be its owner and, in the case of a computer-generated design, this is the person who makes the arrangements for the creation of the design. The proprietor of the design right has exclusive right to use of that design. Moreover, a design registration application is a piece of intellectual property and, as such, can be assigned, licensed and so on just like bricks and mortar property.</P>
    <P>I think the lifetime of this contract is a maximum of 25 years, from the current maximum of 15 years, renewable in five yearly periods. It is possible to defer the publication of registration for up to 30 months from the date the application was filed. Once it goes into commercial use, that licence automatically goes? Is that correct? </P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The controller of the Irish Patents Office has powers which can be exercised as required, including the granting of a compulsory licence &ndash; subject to stringent obligations being met &ndash; for the use of the registered design if the registered owner is not producing sufficient products incorporating that design for which there is a demand within the State. How that would be assessed is an important point. If the registered owner does not produce sufficient products incorporating that design for which there is demand in the State, who will form an opinion on that? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several grounds on which a design can be considered invalid by the controller &ndash; for <Col N="941" /> example, where it conflicts with a prior design, trade marks or national emblems or is contrary to public policy. A section in the Bill allows for exceptions for exclusivity of the protection, including private and non-commercial use, use for experimental purposes and teaching.</P>
    <P>Abuse of a design right can be wide-ranging and infringement extends to those who not only copy the protected work but also who sell, rent, import or even possess infringing products in the course of their business or facilitate an infringement by others. Where an abuse is suspected, the owner of the design registration can apply for civil action to be taken and have the infringing goods seized. This action can be taken by gardaí, without warrant, where there are reasonable grounds to believe them to be infringing goods. It will take much to police this. It is considerable legislation which updates the position from 1927. Does the Minister of State, through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, intend to make the Garda Síochána aware of its powers under this Bill? It is important that it is aware of the law in this regard as well.</P>
    <P>The court may, in addition, or as an alternative to awarding compensation for financial loss to the injured party, impose aggravated and/or exemplary damages. Any person who contravenes the law should be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500 in respect of each infringing product or article or to 12 months' imprisonment. The provision that all communications between an applicant/registered proprietor and his or her patent/trade mark agents has the same status of privilege of confidentiality as in the case of client and solicitor is very important.</P>
    <P>Section 17 covering ownership of designs provides that the creator of the design shall be the author. In relation to a computer-generated design the person who makes the arrangements necessary for the creation of the design shall be considered the author. Policing that will be very important. The controller will have a huge task.</P>
    <P>Section 20 dealing with the application in prescribed form provides for the filling of an application form for registration of a design with the controller by persons claiming to be the owner of the design. The application shall comply with the requirements which will be set out in regulation. As regards filling out an application form, will there be someone who could act as a mentor and who could help companies in this regard, perhaps through Enterprise Ireland or the enterprise boards? The purpose of this Bill is to ensure a certain protection. It is important it is user friendly.</P>
    <P>Section 38 on the inspection of designs register provides for the inspection of the register at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We will need clarification on many sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill. I only got a briefing note on it today, so I am not overly <Col N="942" /> informed on it. From the point of view of small companies, it is important that the Bill is user friendly and that information on it will be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Industrial Designs Bill, 2000. It is a very technical Bill and when it reaches Committee Stage, a lot of detailed work will be done going through it section by section. I praise the Minister of State for his work in this area. In the last couple of years, we have had the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, and the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000. They were very detailed Bills on areas which would not be generally known to the public. They are very important in terms of how economies, businesses and individuals operate. When that Act was being discussed I was contacted about copyright by photographers from my constituency, and there are parallel provisions in section 17 which talks about ownership of designs. The section specifically refers to the creator, namely, the person working on a project, and the employer, who may be the owner of the design. The person who does the work can be cited as the creator when a new design is being registered, and it is important this is taken into account.</P>
      <P>The same issues will arise in this Bill as arose under the Copyright and Related Rights Act and we will receive similar correspondence seeking clarification. In particular we must delineate between people working on their own, under contract, as a direct employee of an organisation, or a person holding a combination of these roles.</P>
      <P>Last week a photographer in my constituency thanked me for a letter I sent him some time ago in relation to queries he raised under the Copyright and Related Rights Act. I got praise from him because of the very detailed and comprehensive letter I received from the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. The photographer read the letter in detail and said it concerned a very important issue for freelance photographers. He and his colleagues discussed the letter which was clear-cut and which explained thoroughly an issue which they at first sight perceived as being very complicated. It is appropriate that I convey the thanks of those people to the Minister. In this Bill he is continuing such work and I expect we will receive correspondence from different people. That the Bill is being discussed in the House will highlight the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is complicated in terms of understanding what is involved. I mentioned copyright and related rights, intellectual property, composers of music, artists, logo designers, those involved in industrial design, etc. It is very hard for a lay person to distinguish between the various Bills. People may not be able to define design, but they know it when they see it. Design in this legislation means &ldquo;the appearance of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines, contours, colour, shape, texture or materials of the product itself or its ornamen<Col N="943" /> tation&rdquo;. This covers a wide variety of items and people will begin to grasp what we are talking about. It is no harm giving people a few concrete examples of what we are talking about so they will understand the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The most common example cited by many people is the design of a Coca-Cola bottle. It is a specific design which is known in every country. The same could be said about the Toblerone bar. This is an era of globalisation, a concept which is supported by some people and opposed by others. Most cars are designed on a global basis, and world-wide there are only between six and eight substantial global car companies. Therefore, globalisation of design is an issue to be addressed and will form part of the world trade talks which are ongoing.</P>
    <P>The clothing industry in Ireland has been mentioned. I remember a celebrated case not so long ago where a high street shop in Dublin went to a design fair across the world to pick out the best and most suitable and attractive First Communion dress for the following season. No sooner was it available here than another shop bought one of the first dresses and sent it to its own manufacturers telling them to change a button from one place to another. Shortly afterwards it appeared in their shops at a fraction of the price. They argued at length that it was a different design, and I am not sure of the final outcome. It highlighted the importance of good design, which helps sell a product, but also shows the inherent risk of other people wanting to take a good design to exploit it for their own commercial gain. This Bill will deal with all such issues.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a rich tradition in design. Our hand crafts and clothes are well known while Waterford Glass has been mentioned by several speakers. Increasingly, our furniture is very well known. It is interesting that the boundaries between the different sectors are changing and being blurred with people beginning to realise design is an issue on its own. Up to now people worked in traditional areas, products and materials and would not have thought they could transfer their skills and ideas to other areas of design and other fields. However, different designers are moving from sector to sector, for example, John Rocha's involvement with Waterford Glass. This shows that design stands on its own and is an art form which can be transferred from one industry to another. For example, it is not necessary to have expertise in the motor car industry in order to design for it. If one has an appreciation of design, of features and contours and of what is appealing and pleasing to the eye one can fit into any industry. Some people have a talent, skill and creative ability and we want to provide protection in this regard.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation is out of date. There was a reference to legislation passed in 1927 which we are now updating for the first time. The concept of patents, copyright and ownership of design is long established. Many centuries ago there was a <Col N="944" /> question about the Book of Durrow. When a copy of it was made the relevant person was asked to adjudicate. A famous judgment was issued which still holds and is the essence of patent, copyright and design law, namely, to every cow its calf. It might seem a funny phrase in these times, but it was understood by everybody at a time when society was not urbanised and industrialised as it is now. People understood the rural way of life and that a calf is a product of the cow. In the same way ownership of the offshoot of something reverts to the original creator. It is a very old concept which people understand, and it is important given the changes in commerce and legislation that the laws are updated on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow us implement and operate EU directives and ratify various associated agreements. It will also allow us fully participate in the world trade agreements and get protection under the agreements which have been signed. It will also ensure we can benefit from the international systems of registration.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned definitions of design. There are different bodies which have a significant role to play in terms of design, such as the National College of Art and Design. In particular, Enterprise Ireland, mentioned by Deputy Perry, has an important role, as do local county enterprise boards, in ensuring thought and research is put into product design. There has been a lack in this area. Recently a lady in my constituency who has set up a product design company came to me and when she mentioned design I immediately thought about graphic design, etc. However, she is concerned with product design and explained the process to me whereby she meets senior people in a business and gets an understanding of their customers' needs. It is an entire process and a bigger issue that people appreciate. Almost everyone nowadays owns a mobile phone. A few short years ago these items were big and clumsy but they now come in all shapes, sizes and colours. The same can be said about the new Apple mat which has a particular design and makes a statement on its own. Under the legislation, that design is entitled to protection.</P>
    <P>In relation to design, something which is much more in the minds of designers nowadays than heretofore is the question of environmental issues, the recycling of existing materials and the use of recycled products. We know from debates on waste management that we cannot continue to design new products to be ultimately discarded. There is an environmental cost to every new product which comes on the market and I appeal to designers to take that fact into consideration at the early stages.</P>
    <P>We could ask about design which is not just commercial. Many public features have a particular design of which people will be instantly aware. Members will recall the competition which took place in relation to the spike in O'Connell Street <Col N="945" /> on which people instantly had a particular view. The same can be said about many features on various motorways and street furniture which is designed to serve a particular purpose, including architecture. Design has been very much neglected in this country and we need to concentrate further on that issue to ensure it is properly protected.</P>
    <P>In an era of e-commerce and computer-assisted designs, it is essential to be up-to-date and in a position to take on board all these new arrangements. I am pleased that in due course designers will be able to apply electronically for registration. I am aware it will take some time for the various bodies to get fully geared up for this development but the passage of this legislation will facilitate that aspect. I look forward to the availability of electronic registration in the near future. This will also be beneficial for people introducing new designs. They can check electronically to see if this has been done before and save unnecessary time, effort and possible litigation down the road. I look forward to the implementation of this aspect which will assist existing and future designers.</P>
    <P>One could say that the legislation is about protecting design because it is all about business and trade. I mentioned the European directive and world trade talks on which it has a big impact. As all designs are created by individuals in the first instance, that individual is protected under this legislation and is entitled to due recognition on foot of it. It is very important that is the case because, even though these people might be a small cog in a big wheel, individual input is very important. The reason I say that is because I believe industry and the whole commercial and business environment in which we operate is changing. Many years ago we were taught that the two key features needed in relation to any business or organisation was labour and capital. That philosophy is now becoming a little outdated because there is a third more important component, which is ideas. Businesses which do not come forward with new ideas will go nowhere.</P>
    <P>Last night I listened to George Lee on television speak about the Irish and world economy. He said there is currently too much money in the western democracies. I believe that where there are good ideas there is no shortage of money. Finding capital, therefore, for a good design or product is not a problem and in this day and age there tends to be sufficient labour in the western world. The only limiting factor currently is good ideas and good designs, which will be the difference between successful and unsuccessful businesses. If we look 20 years down the road, the successful companies will not be the ones with the successful bank balance or the biggest access to employment today but those that were able to introduce new ideas and designs. That factor will become more and more evident.</P>
    <P>We have seen the proof of this over the years with the various &ldquo;dot.com&rdquo; companies. All one <Col N="946" /> had to do was stick the name &ldquo;dot.com&rdquo; on the company and fools came charging to hand over money. Some deserved to lose their money because fools and their money can easily be parted. We have seen that happen in this situation. I recall a cartoon in <i>Phoenix</i> magazine a few weeks ago showing two people begging in the street outside the Financial Services Centre. One person had &ldquo;donations please&rdquo; written on the card he was holding and there was nothing on it. The other person sitting beside him had &ldquo;donations please dot.com&rdquo; written on his card and his box was full &ndash; I think that says it all. There is plenty of money in the world. It is said that from a global point of view there are more people than the planet can sustain, therefore labour and capital will not be crucial factors. It will take ideas, designs and people's intellectual ability to make the world a better place.</P>
    <P>This legislation is very timely. However, the Minister of State should take into consideration the role of the consumer because this legislation seems to be about helping those who are involved in trade. In due course, consumers should be given a focus, particularly at European and world trade talks level. People are concerned about globalisation because they perceive these European and world trade talks as solely and exclusively ensuring that big businesses of the western world can trade and sell their products freely wherever they are entitled to do so. I want to ensure there is a balance, that there are not restrictive practices when designs are registered so that people can charge excessive prices because they have legal protection for their designs which they can exploit. This has happened in South Africa on a related issue. The South African Government recently took on the world pharmaceutical companies who were importing cheap copies of medical products to deal with the AIDS epidemic in that country. Because these companies had international patents, people were being forced to pay a high price for these products. In that situation, the world community, world businesses and trade organisations were putting the commercial interests of those organisations above the health and well-being of individuals. When we reach the next round of world talks, I would like to see the role of consumers and individuals being put on an equal basis with the role of the commercial and trading rights of these organisations. This will work to the benefit of everyone at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has a particularly good understanding of this area. I mentioned other legislation with which he dealt and took a great interest. I know he will listen to all the comments on Committee Stage and if good suggestions are put forward he will study them closely and incorporate them in the legislation, if appropriate. I look forward to the passage of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it is important to update our legislation. I presume the <Col N="947" /> legislation is necessary to keep up-to-date with EU legislation. This is necessary given that many small industries throughout the country are currently providing a lot of employment. It is important that small companies and individuals who introduce new ideas and new products are protected so that their businesses can continue. Larger operators should not be able to move in and copy the designs and products of these people. The textile and clothing industry in this country is very important. They must be protected by legislation. It is the only way to proceed. According to the Minister of State the most effective and transparent way in which to protect industrial design is through a system of registration which offers clarity and certainty and provides a system of information on the registered rights holders and the existence of rights. When straightforward information is available to all necessary information can be obtained. That gives producers and those involved in business the confidence to know that their product, idea or design will not be availed of by their opposition or others in their business.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is right and proper that the country should update legislation to keep it in line with EU regulations and what is happening with our partners in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for summing up for his party and I appreciate the contributions made by Deputies. This is very technical legislation. I also thank those who have acknowledged the work I have tried to do on behalf of those involved in the intellectual property area. Those of us involved in Committee Stage of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill are aware of how time consuming were our deliberations. Nevertheless, having concluded our work and listened to advice from lobbyists on all sides we made a collective effort to enact very good legislation in that area. In this Bill we are filling a gap with regard to another area of intellectual property legislation. It is also part of fulfilling our responsibilities at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies pointed out that the explanatory memorandum is very technical. I and other Ministers have always impressed on those preparing legislation the need to make it user friendly. In this instance every effort was made to keep technical aspects to a minimum and to produce user friendly and comprehensible legislation. However, unfortunately &ndash; most Deputies acknowledge this &ndash; the nature of the subject matter here is such that it is not possible to choose language of our own making in all cases. The legal definitions in the interpretation section are largely based on the definitions and language used in the EU directive on the legal protection of designs. Given the highly technical nature of the directive, acknowledged by all Members of the House, we must be careful in transposing its terms into law to ensure that it is compatible and <Col N="948" /> consistent with the directive. Deputies Perry, Flanagan and others made the point that we need to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry referred to the concerns of small businesses. The Patents Office will publish user friendly booklets and information on industrial designs when the Bill is implemented as it did with patents and trademarks. With regard to assistance in completing application forms for small businesses, the services of patents and trademarks agents and solicitors are available. It is our intention to draft regulations in user friendly language that is easily understandable for ordinary citizens. This would facilitate do it yourself applications. The staff of the Patents Office will assist with any queries in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is provided that designers shall have access to the District Court to enable them to quickly and efficiently implement their rights. Users have made the case that access to the District Court would be very useful in the quick and effective protection of copyright and design rights. The experts referred to are intended to be expert advisers who, acting on behalf of rights owners, will assist the gardaí in search and seizure activities to ensure that justice is done in a thorough and effective manner. It is not intended that a public panel, as such, be established but rather that the rights owner himself or herself will appoint his or her own representative.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan correctly pointed out that the definition of &ldquo;product&rdquo; in the Bill excluded computer programmes from protection as industrial design. The area of protection for computer programming is generally covered by copyright law. There are also discussions at EU level with a view to the protection of computer programmes by patents. This issue was raised in the Dáil and the Seanad when we debated copyright legislation. However, design law is only concerned with the appearance of products, so while the underlying computer code is protected by copyright etc., the end product which emerges from the computer programme must also be protected by law. The Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies rightly referred to the achievement of Irish designers. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned some of our great successes, including Waterford Glass. Others include John Rocha, Paul Costelloe and Philip Treacy, who hails from east Galway and who was mentioned by Deputy Perry. Our traditional handicraft and design industries have achieved penetration in many world-wide markets, not least in the US. It is important that these works are protected.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies rightly referred to the importance of ideas and innovation. That is what we are trying to protect here. It was also rightly pointed out that this whole area of innovation and creativity must be central to our economic success into the future. A sporting example would be the work of Irish designers in conjunction with their British counterparts on, for example, Jordan and other Formula One motor racing cars.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> Articles of a literary or artistic nature may be registered if the designer wishes to co-register the design and if it meets the criteria for design registration under the 1927 Act. Alternatively, designers may wish to avail of copyright protection instead. If they are qualified for protection the term of protection extends for the longer period of life plus 70 years under that law. Under the new law a designer will be able to have both copyright and registration protection for 25 years.</P>
    <P>With regard to grace periods, a one year grace period shall apply during which any making available of the design shall not be taken into account for the purpose of establishing novelty of design. This permits the designer to explore the commercial possibilities of the design prior to investing time and money in the process of registration and replaces the old legislative exception for exhibition at international design and craft fairs.</P>
    <P>The 30 month period of deferment of publication of registration of industrial design is the standard period of deferment contained in The Hague agreement and the Community design regulation. It makes no sense for Ireland to make different provisions in this area. The Community design office in Alicante will be established to implement the proposed EU community design regulation. While it is not appropriate to speak of Irish representation in an office that does not yet exist, access to jobs in it when established will be open to Irish and other EU citizens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry inquired if a design is still protected once it goes into commercial use. It is still protected for up to 25 years from the date of registration where a registered design is not used or supplied. There are provisions to grant compulsory licences to other companies who may wish to use a design to meet a market demand.</P>
    <P>Registration of designs currently only gives protection in respect of the territory of Ireland. However, access to protection on the EU and international stage for Irish designers will be provided through ratification of The Hague agreement and, the final adoption is expected shortly of the EU Community Design Regulation. All the more reason why this Bill must be enacted as soon as possible. Deputies will know that the administration of the existing system of registration and protection of industrial design is a function of the Controller of Patents Design Trademarks and Patents Office. The workload involved on industrial design registration and renewal is minimal compared with that of trademark registration or the granting of patents. In the year 2000, the Patents Office received 4,804 trademark applications, compared to just 560 industrial design applications. It registered 6,861 trademarks compared to 588 industrial designs. As such, it has been relatively easy for the Patents Office to keep abreast of the requirements of applicants and proprietors of registered designs. The office is currently preparing and planning for the introduction of a new computer system for the administration of industrial design matters and which will reduce the amount of paperwork <Col N="950" /> and make things easier for everybody. I know many Deputies will welcome that. I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and all the Deputies who contributed to this debate. I do not see this as a controversial Bill in the light of the debate and I hope it can now proceed to the next Stage.</P>

      <P>Job losses are of major concern to everybody and recent job loss announcements reflect the fact that, notwithstanding the success of the Irish economy, the maintenance of competitiveness remains a key challenge. The most vulnerable jobs in Ireland are those in relatively low skill areas, where openness to competitive pressures is greatest. Concentration on upskilling and retraining the workforce is essential to meet the demands of the changing environment. A primary element of current policy being implemented by the industrial development agencies is to assist companies to move up the value chain into higher skilled and better paid jobs, which should help to secure employment.</P>
      <P>The slowdown in the US economy is having a negative impact on the overseas-owned manufacturing sector in Ireland, resulting in job losses and slowdown in recruitment and planned expansions by some major multinationals. However, the current buoyant labour market conditions in the economy mean that those losing jobs are unlikely to experience significant difficulty in finding alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> Further slowdown of the US and European economies could affect job creation prospects. The impact to date on the Irish economy in terms of growth, and employment-unemployment has been small and has been confined mainly to the information technology related sectors. IDA assisted companies in this area are relatively new and focused on higher value products, often incorporating functions such as customer-technical support, software development, and logistics, which make them less vulnerable. However, a stronger and more prolonged slowdown in the US economy would have more serious consequences for growth and employment in Ireland. It is essential, therefore, that key issues over which we have some control, and which impact significantly on the competitiveness of Ireland as a base for investment, should continue to be given priority attention and addressed. Key issues include implementing the national development plan on schedule, particularly the rollout of infrastructure into the regions, wage and price inflation, ensuring a stable industrial relations environment and adequate skills supply. The development agencies will continue to promote vigorously industrial development in unemployment blackspots throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As regards specific company downsizing or closures, the State agencies work closely together and with local authorities and other local development interests to facilitate an integrated development approach and promote a favourable climate for business. In such cases, the attraction of replacement jobs, expansion of existing industry, provision of retraining and identification of alternative employment opportunities will continue to be high priorities.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept in light of weekly announcements of actual redundancies and layoffs and threatened redundancies over a wide range of sectors but with particular reference to the high tech sector that the bubble has burst and that we have had our best years? While I accept there are many measures outside our control, what action does she propose to take to mitigate the loss to our economy? In the industries experiencing closures and cutbacks here, particularly in the high tech sector, there appears to be a change in global enterprise involving smaller highly advanced technological equipment, hand-held equipment, rather than the traditional PC equipment for which this economy has been noted in terms of our export business issue. What steps has she taken to attract the higher tech and smaller hand-held devices and equipment engaged in by some companies which are siting their euro headquarters in states other than Ireland? Has she made inquiries with a view to setting up meetings to promote Ireland as an <Col N="952" /> attractive location for this type of higher technologically advanced industry?</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Most of the inward investment being attracted is at the high end of the business. We have done extremely well during the past 18 months and the pipeline is good in relation to biotechnology. Most of the manufacturing of a hand-held set or a traditional PC will not be done in Ireland but elsewhere. What we offer is the higher end of the business. In the main we are attractive where a high level of research and development is involved and where high level engineering skills are required. That is the reason there has been a strong emphasis on education in recent years. At the end of this academic year in June we will have produced more IT graduates than Germany, which is a much larger country. Virtually all my overseas work with the IDA recently has been with a view to getting the higher value end of the business. There are fewer jobs but that is where Ireland is at. We are winning over 23% of the mobile investment from the US and Europe. This is the highest proportion for any country and yet we have under 1% of the European population. We must not forget we are doing extremely well. The challenge is to get some of that investment into the regions. Infrastructure has a key part to play in making the regions attractive.</P>

      <Quest> when she intends to bring forward legislation to implement the recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group dealing with newspaper and media mergers and cross-ownership of the media; the plans she has to expedite the enactment of the legislation, especially having regard to recent reports of competing bids to acquire a company (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have now cleared all policy aspects of a general scheme of a Bill to give effect to certain recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group, including those arising from the report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. I expect to circulate the scheme to other Departments during this month with a view to obtaining an early Government decision to authorise drafting of the Bill and I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill later this year. It is my intention that the new legislation will strengthen existing arrangements in relation to newspapers/media mergers, in particular, first by extending the scope of enterprises to be covered beyond those which at present are covered by the newspapers order to include enterprises in the wider media field. Merger control will apply to these enterprises irrespective of size; second, by introducing public interest criteria specifically geared to the media sector; and third by extending merger law to cover acquisitions of control of an undertaking by means other than the acquisition of shares or assets.</P>
      <P>It is not clear at this stage whether the individual case to which the Deputy refers will result in a notification to me under the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, or to the European Commission under the EU merger legislation. If it is the former, I point out that the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978, to 1996, in their present form do provide for considerations relating to the common good as well as to competition.</P>
      <P>Under EU law large-scale mergers and acquisitions which have a Community dimension as defined by the EU merger regulations are subject to pre-notification to the EU Commission. While my Department and the Competition Authority can make their views known to the Commission on these cases, as indeed can other interested parties, it is the Commission which makes the final decision.</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that diversity in the media is essential to the quality of our democracy? Given the changing nature of the media and the phenomenon of converging technologies, the prospect of takeover of Eircom's fixed line business by any group that is already predominant in the print industry might have adverse implications for the reasons I have indicated. I ask the Tánaiste not to favour one bidder against another &ndash; I certainly do not favour one bidder against another &ndash; but am merely concerned that there is a competition angle to this. I ask the Tánaiste to indicate her thoughts on this given the importance of diversity in the media.</P>

      <P>Without commenting on any individual applications that might come before me, which would be wrong to do on this occasion, I agree totally with Deputy Rabbitte. We must take a holistic view and the maintenance and preservation of our democracy means that media mergers in particular have a hugely significant role to play. We want to see as much diversity as possible and that is why all media mergers have to be referred to the Minister but in addition to that we need to go further in the context of the new legislation and deal with what is commonly called cross-media ownership. The definitions of the past were made in a very different environment and technology today has the capacity to do a lot more. It is important to bear that in mind. If two merging companies have an asset base of £10 million or an annual turnover of £20 million the merger has to be referred. If they are on a substantial, large scale and they are involved in two or more countries within the EU &ndash; if the turnover is over 5 billion, for example &ndash; then that is a matter for the European Commission. I am not yet certain which body may consider any formal bid involving the proposal referred to in the Deputy's question but it would either be to the Irish authorities or the European Commission.</P>

      <P>Without referring to any particular case, does the Tánaiste agree that in respect of cross-ownership of the media there is a manifest issue in respect of concentration of ownership of the print media on one hand and acquisition of the fixed line capacity of Eircom on the other? Given the nature of converging technologies, that link into the households of Ireland could be critical for the development of a number of multimedia projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with the Deputy that that is the case. The new legislation will provide for that. Under the existing legislation if there is an asset base of £10 million in either of the merging companies or a turnover of £20 million, which are relatively small thresholds, it has to be referred, so the existing law covers any situation that could arise in the Irish context as far as I can see. We need to go further on cross-media ownership and to define that more clearly or with more flexibility in the context of today's circumstances.</P>

      <P>Regarding the first question, I am quite satisfied that if there is any takeover bid for Eircom it will either be referred to the Minister in Ireland under the existing law or the European Commission and that it will be something that is referrable and therefore covered by existing powers. That is not to say the powers in relation to the media generally are strong enough; they are not. They must and will be updated.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Competition Authority I am not aware of anything that did not happen because of a lack of resources but I am aware that it has worked under a considerable restraint in recent years and that that is why it is important it gets the resources. That is why, in order to get those resources, we had an independent analysis carried out by Deloitte Touche. When the interim report was presented we gave it additional resources and further resources are to be made available shortly.</P>

      <P>I welcome the OECD report on regulatory reform published last week and I share its conclusions by and large. I particularly welcome the OECD's emphasis that the interest of the consumer has to be at the heart of regulation. The report contains some important messages, including reminding us of action which needs to be taken at a time when we are planning to build on the successes already achieved in the economy.</P>
      <P>In general terms the report comments favourably on the many positive aspects of Ireland's regulatory regime, including the openness of our markets to international trade and progress made in the fields of competition law, aviation and telecommunications regulation. It also highlights areas where further progress must be made and the Government at its meeting last week adopted a number of measures to address these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> The measures include preparation of a major national policy statement on regulatory reform, the establishment of a high level group on regulation to oversee implementation of Ireland's response to the OECD report, the development of a new mechanism by which Government Departments and public bodies will be subjected to regulatory impact assessment for any new proposals or regulations being made, requesting the Competition Authority to initiate a comprehensive study of the professional services sector by which Government Departments and public bodies will be subjected to regulatory impact assessment on any proposals or regulations being made.

      <P>On the statement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last week, following the publication of the OECD report, that she looked forward to having a gin and tonic in a restaurant, what does she mean by deregulation? What, in essence, will deregulation allow? Does she intend to have a gin and tonic in Harry Ramsden's in her constituency or in one of the many McDonald's franchise restaurants around the country? </P>
      <P>When people talk about deregulation, it is my understanding that they mean different things. Can the Minister spell out exactly what she proposes in the context of deregulation legislation which will be enacted within a year? What will that legislation mean for the licensed intoxicating liquor trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt I mentioned gin and tonic as I do not think I ever had such a drink in my life, it is not a drink I favour. I look forward to strolling a few yards from Leinster House to have <Col N="957" /> a beer without having to go to a pub. In most European cities, including virtually every city of which I am aware, one can walk into a regular café to have a beer. That is not the case in Ireland, however, as pub culture dominates. That is no longer acceptable for a modern capital like Dublin.</P>
      <P>This problem can be found throughout the country, especially in large urban areas. Deputy Rabbitte is probably more familiar than am I with the fact that there are only about five or six pubs in Tallaght. I estimate that there are far more pubs in virtually every town in Deputy Flanagan's constituency. We have operated under archaic legislation in this area and others, which has had a negative impact on prices and consumer choice. We need to change the drink culture as much as the outlets in which alcoholic drink is available. The most important thing is that we have reasonable laws which enforce competition, increase consumer choice and put the consumer first.</P>
      <P>I accept that the social dimension of drinking is a huge problem in Ireland and results from the culture and history of drink here. Change must be brought about by enforcing the law in relation to under age drinking, perhaps by introducing identity cards, but that is a separate question. It is not in our interest as a nation to maintain the regime that prevails at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the arguments put forward in the OECD report and which was latched on to by both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste was that deregulation and liberalisation would reduce prices. That argument is not necessarily valid, however, as is evident by looking at the taxi issue. Only last week, fares were increased by 15%, so nobody can say taxi prices have come down since deregulation. The opposite is the case. There is no evidence that a free-for-all in the drinks market would lead to lower prices. What experience or authority did the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment draw upon to indicate as vociferously as she did, that prices will be reduced? </P>
      <P>If there is an element of liberalisation and deregulation needed within the licensed business, it is exclusively within the east coast metropolitan area of Dublin, particularly her own constituency as was mentioned. There is no need for deregulation or a free-for-all, as the regulation of intoxicating liquor was originally put in place due to the dangers of abusing the substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Licensing those that can sell alcohol and imposing appropriate planning controls is certainly important. Before I answer the Deputy's question about what information I called on, in making this decision, I should say that taxi fares are not deregulated. We do not have a free market in fares as they are regulated, which is a problem. A glance at sectors like air travel, other <Col N="958" /> means of transport and telecommunications shows that increased service and better value for money result from genuine competition. If £2 million is paid for a pub, the consumers of the alcohol will end up paying more, which cannot be justified. There is an unsatisfactory situation in Dublin and other large urban areas. This situation must be dealt with in a sensible way and I believe that it will be.</P>

      <P>It is important, in the public interest, that we know the identity of any consortium or consortia. We cannot enforce competition if we are not fully aware of who the proposed bidders and people in charge of a potential takeover may be. I do not know if the Competition Authority will have a role. It depends on whether the scale is such that it needs to be dealt with in <Col N="959" /> Ireland or by the European Commission. If the purchase is looked at in Ireland, the Minister can refer it to the authority and if it is dealt with by the Commission, the authority can make its views known. I expect the views of the Competition Authority to be sought in relation to something as major as the proposed sale of Eircom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two brief questions. Does the Minister agree with comments recently attributed to the telecommunications regulator, Ms Etain Doyle, who said that Eircom should not be a dominant player in both the fixed residential line market and cable television? In the public interest, does the Minister or her Department have a role in ensuring that the fixed communications proprietor fulfils its obligation to the State by ensuring that the £37 million contract for infrastructural development in the BMW region is fulfilled? Does the State have a role in ensuring that this matter is addressed, particularly given the need to ensure that targets in the national development plan are met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's second inquiry on when licences are issued or applications are sought for them, there is a debate between what are commonly called the beauty contest and the auction. I favour bids being sought on the basis of scale of coverage, rather than a direct auction to the highest bidder. While the taxpayer may gain from the auction in the short-term, the economy does not in the medium and long-terms. Recently we have seen some huge failures in option-related bids in the EU. Therefore, I certainly share the Deputy's view that we make sure, in so far as we can, that any new licensing regime will be able to provide availability of service. That is very important, particularly if one wants to develop the regions.</P>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question related to what the regulator said. The Government position is not really the issue here. Once there is fair competition and a dominant position is not being abused, that is what is important. Generally I would favour what the regulator said. Where one company is particularly dominant, it becomes very difficult for others to be able to compete in that kind of market. That is why we must ensure that there is a competition authority which enforces fair and even competition in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>It is only in recent years that there have been enforcement powers. In fact, it is only ten years since competition legislation was introduced. More recently, the Government, which the Deputy supported, introduced the enforcement powers for that authority. That is a welcome development. It is important, regardless of size, that we enforce competition.</P>

    <P>This guide was produced in consultation with the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, the Irish Bankers' Federation and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, and has been distributed through a number of channels: by post, directly to 40,000 retail outlets throughout this country; <Col N="961" /> by a wide variety of retail organisations to their members; through the chambers of commerce, city and county enterprise boards, area partnerships and other organisations; by five of the main commercial banks directly to their retail customers; as an insert in a number of retail trade publications; and at presentations, exhibitions and conferences attended by the EMU campaign.</P>
    <P>The guide outlines what will happen on -day, 1 January 2002, when euro notes and coins are introduced into circulation, and the specific role that retailers will play in the changeover process. It includes a checklist of issues to be considered by all retailers in preparing their own plan to manage the changeover, including how to convert Irish pound amounts to euro, dual display, dealing with dual circulation, staff training and advice on estimating euro cash requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>This is in addition to the significant amount of work that the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has undertaken, and continues to undertake, to inform and educate consumers about the changeover.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank's role with regard to public information mainly derives from a European system of central banks campaign, which, in the last quarter of the year, will be focusing on the detailed designs and security features of euro bank notes</P>
    <P>With regard to dual display, in the survey conducted for the EMU business awareness campaign last December, 58% of retail firms indicated their intention to display dual prices in Irish pound and euro amounts by the fourth quarter of 2001. The initial figures from the campaign's latest survey indicate that this figure has risen considerably, with approximately 70% of retail firms indicating their intention to dual price by the end of next September. Additionally, there is the national code on euro changeover which the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, relaunched last December, incorporating the special logo to be made available to subscribers by the Director of Consumer Affairs. This is a national code of practice on dual display of prices and the minimum period of application of the code for subscribers begins on 1 October next.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of each firm to ensure that it is able to conduct business in euro from 1 January 2002, and the EMU business awareness campaign can only assist in providing the necessary information that will assist firms to achieve this.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that a recent Forfás survey stated that only 23% of companies have a plan for the changeover, that despite what he stated in his reply there is a huge lack of information throughout the retail trade? As a retailer, I know from talking to people <Col N="962" /> within the trade that clearly there is a major breakdown in the availability of information to staff and consumers, both of whom will be educated in this regard by the retailers. Is the Minister of State happy that only 23% of companies have a plan and that the survey to which I refer stated that 54% of companies had no intention of preparing a plan? Is he also aware that 34% of companies have decided they will implement the changeover on 1 January next and 43% have no plan as such? Is he aware that a large number of companies are totally unaware that dual pricing must be provided by 1 October and have no intention of providing dual pricing on that date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am not happy with the situation. We are pleased that at this stage about 76% of businesses would be satisfied with the information they have. Certainly we are worried about some companies, particularly smaller companies. The big companies and medium-sized companies in the retail and wholesale sector are aware of, alert to and active in this area. These companies have plans to manage the changeover but in the smaller retailers, particularly those in the west and north-west, there is a serious lack of information, focus and commitment. Through the statutory bodies, the State agencies, and the business organisations, and particularly the high profile which the national euro conference gave to the western region, we are confident that the campaign is beginning to make an impact. With the collective commitment of all people in business, including the leadership of public representatives, we hope that like in the case of the Y2K problem we will be able to manage this successfully and be ready for the changeover on 1 January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State plans to accelerate the campaign, which is lacking impact? The campaign in the national media is not nearly effective enough. It does not highlight the huge problems which will arise. We are within six months of an implementation of the changeover. Is the Minister also happy that the code of practice which has been drafted by the industry will be implemented? I believe it will not. He must remember that the small companies will be the ones which will introduce the euro to ordinary people on 1 January. It will be a major problem. Would he agree that it would take six months for any small company to implement even the basic software package?</P>

      <P>At national level, we have taken the necessary legislative decisions which are vital to the changeover. We are confident that the code of practice will be implemented. There is an excellent team handling this in Forfás, the EMU team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that, in co-operation with the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the <Col N="963" /> various business organisations, we get a clear message out to all the companies that it is critical for them. This change provides significant opportunities for Irish companies and the Irish economy and we must manage it carefully. We must ensure that the consumers are pushing to ensure that they will get the necessary information, that they participate with the companies and that the pressure is on local companies to ensure that the business people are ready on the big day, 1 January.</P>

      <P>Directive 85/374/EEC was implemented by the Liability for Defective Products Act, 1991. The main effect of the Act was to introduce into Irish law the principle of strict liability &ndash; no fault &ndash; on the producer, irrespective of whether there was negligence involved on the part of producers/manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Last year we made the European Communities (Liability for Defective Products) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 &ndash; S.I. No. 104 of 2000 &ndash; which implemented Directive 99/34/EC. That directive, among other things, discontinued the derogation in the original 1985 directive referred to by the Deputy. The effect of the earlier derogation was to remove agricultural producers and electricity producers from the scope of the 1985 directive. As I have stated earlier, the new regulations have discontinued that exemption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the farming community would be aware of this because this issue would have been discussed at European Parliament level and they would be fully aware of developments at that level. Clearly there are positive implications for consumers in the sense of that they would now have a right to compensation for harm caused by agricultural products or game.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that there has not been a case to date, but I will check that and let the Deputy know if there has been such a case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, which I recently launched, is a comprehensive examination of the issue of workplace bullying. The task force had three basic terms of reference: to identify the size of the problem and the sectors most at risk; to develop practical programmes and strategies to prevent workplace bullying; and to produce a co-ordinated response from the State agencies.</P>
      <P>As part of its work the task force commissioned an independent national survey on workplace bullying, which was carried out by the ESRI. The survey and its findings represent a significant component of the task force report, capturing as it does a full picture of the incidence and characteristics of workplace bullying in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The findings of this survey, including the finding that 9.5% of females currently in the workforce record themselves as having been bullied in the six months preceding the survey and that the incidence rate among females is 1.8 times that among men, will enable the State and individual enterprises and employers to undertake appropriate and targeted actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force has made a number of wide-ranging recommendations. The principal recommendations relating to action at State level include the designation of the HSA as the central co-ordinating State agency for matters concerning the prevention of workplace bullying, the introduction of codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, the Industrial Relations Act, and the Employment Equality Act and the establishment of an advisory committee. The purpose of the codes of practice will be to provide guidance on putting in place policies and pro<Col N="965" /> cedures at the level of individual enterprises and as a basis and a reference point for the relevant State agencies.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee will have a key role in co-ordinating and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations relating to the State's role in responding to workplace bullying, including the promotion of the three codes of practice. The proposed membership of the advisory committee will include representation from the main State agencies and bodies currently dealing with workplace equality, welfare and labour relations issues, in addition to IBEC and ICTU.</P>
    <P>The board of the Health and Safety Authority has adopted the task force report and its recommendations. I have asked all parties to the recommendations to advance their implementation as soon as possible. In particular, I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission and the chairman of the Health and Safety Authority asking that the codes of practice, which are to be developed under their areas of responsibility, be completed as a matter of urgency. I have indicated I would like the codes finalised within three months.</P>
    <P>I ask individual employers and enterprises to take on board the recommendations in the report and, in particular, the dignity at work charter recommended by the task force.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>I welcome this report and its conclusions and recommendations. I am confident the implementation of the recommendations will have a positive impact in addressing the issue of workplace bullying in the long-term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  While the ESRI report produced fairly disturbing results, the situation is in effect far more serious than that outlined in the report. I remind the Minister of State of a further survey undertaken by the anti-bullying research unit in Trinity College which showed that up to 40% of those surveyed experienced bullying in the workplace. This is a most serious and disturbing matter that requires the urgent attention of his Department. Why is he ruling out specific anti-bullying legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is more than likely the problem is much more serious than what has emerged from the ESRI report. That appears to be the case from reports I have heard, from some of the harrowing experiences expressed to me by individuals in the workplace and from the fact that many people do not report incidents of workplace bullying. I am very much aware of Dr. Mona O'Moore's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force has not recommended the introduction of legislation, but it has recommended the introduction of three codes of practice. Codes <Col N="966" /> of practice in modern industrial relations are admissible in evidence and breaches of them have been taken into consideration in relevant proceedings and such codes of practice have a quasi-legal status. The recommendation to introduce those codes of practice is an important step along the way. I said at the launch of this task force that I would not rule out the introduction of legislation on this area in the future. This is an important task force report. It is important we implement it as soon as possible. Having initiated this debate on workplace bullying, I am determined to see it through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State been furnished with figures on bullying in the workplace through cases that have come to the attention of the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court, or is he of the opinion that in so far as they relate to the private sector such cases do not get as far as the Labour Relations Commission or any mediation machinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging what the Minister of State said, reports and surveys are of little use without concrete action. If I was an employee in a company with a difficulty and I regarded myself as a victim of harassment or bullying, to whom would I make a complaint? What role has the Health and Safety Authority in prosecuting such complaint and dealing with matter to the satisfaction of the victim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The main figures available are from some of the research done by Dr. Mona O'Moore of the anti-bullying centre and from this report. With regard to the LRC and other such institutions, one of the dilemmas is to whom does an employee approach to make a complaint? We are aware of high profile cases brought to the Employment Appeals Tribunal that were employment related or were brought following a dismissal. This is one of the issues we need to deal with. I do not have precise figures on the LRC side. The task force has managed to bring all this together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer Deputy Flanagan's question, the co-ordinating agency is the Health and Safety Authority. As Minister of State with responsibility for labour, I have endeavoured to widen the scope of the Health and Safety Authority beyond the physical environmental to include the broader psychological and psychosocial environment. If a person has a problem in the workplace, I recommend he or she brings it to the level of the Health and Safety Authority. It will inspect matters in some cases and check if there is a safety statement and an anti-bullying policy in place. The dignity at work charter is a tremendous example of what every employment and enterprise should immediately put in place. It is a matter of common sense to respect people in the workplace. There is much good work on this area, but it is <Col N="967" /> the responsibility of employers and unions to work on this area and to implement the recommendations of this report. I will keep the House informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 12, 17 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recent Government decision on this matter, an interdepartmental implementation group has been set up to progress the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board to be known as PIAB. The group convened its first meeting earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service is represented on the group and the issue of the relationship between the courts and the PIAB will be addressed in the course of the group's work. The intention is that the PIAB, at this point in time, will operate within the overall courts structure. The group, which also includes a representative from the Office of the Attorney General, will consider what legislative changes, if any, are necessary in advance of the PIAB being established. The group hopes to submit its report before the end of this year, with the PIAB becoming operational in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation for work related injuries in its initial term of operation and later in motor injury cases. The special working group which recommended the establishment of <Col N="968" /> the PIAB conducted a preliminary examination of the potential savings that could be achieved in the delivery costs of compensation. While this suggests that such savings would be substantial, it is difficult to be precise since the extent of the savings will depend, for example, on the proportion of cases in which the PIAB judgment forms the basis of settlement as well as issues such as the operating costs of the new assessment board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Will he agree that with the establishing of a personal injuries assessment board the victim must remain in premier position, as is currently the case? Will he outline the steps he proposes to take to ensure that the employer will not be the main beneficiary of this new board? Will he also outline his views on the bureaucratic layer he intends to set up its relationship with the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of establishing this board is to ensure that the victim is in premier position, but as of now the victim does not seem to be in that position. The reason for the establishment of the board has been the major cost of delivering personal injuries compensation. Junior counsel is appointed in 57% of cases and senior counsel in 18% of cases here, compared to the UK where junior counsel is appointed in only 3% of cases and senior counsel is rarely, if ever, appointed. There is a huge implication in the cost delivery factor to date, which we must now change. The objective is to eliminate this very high cost factor, to have each case considered in a practical and positive manner and reach a conclusion. When an award is offered, the injured party can then decide whether to accept it or proceed to the courts. The board will deal with issues of quantum only, not liability. It will not interfere with a person's right to take court action, or prejudice any future court action taken by victims. In its first phase of operation, the board will deal with employers' liability claims only.</P>
      <P>The legal profession must accept that the delivery cost of personal injuries compensation in Ireland is far too high. In Deputy Flanagan's dual capacity, I would like to hear his position on this matter and whether his party endorses what we wish to achieve, in terms of delivering to the victims of injury quickly, fairly and equitably.</P>

Deputy Rabbitte already knows the answers to his questions, as he was involved in initiating this concept. It was not an easy matter to have a report completed and delivered to us. We have got that report and have acted on it. The Government has taken a decision and we are proceeding.

    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> We expect to commence dealing with personal injuries under employers' liability on 1 January 2002, and to follow up on 1 January 2003, with motor insurance. Discussions are ongoing between the legal, insurance and other interests involved in this situation. The interdepartmental committee has commenced its work. We are very confident that this will be a positive development and it deserves the support of everybody concerned. We have a collective duty to achieve success on behalf of the citizen or consumer who suffers injury.</P>
    <P>There are many vested interests who do not like to hear about this. I have no commitment from the insurance industry that they will reduce premiums and I would not expect to get it. I have taken several practical steps over the past few years and I will be answering further questions on that later.

Will he also confirm that he did not engage in any consultation with the Court Services Board?

Does the Minister not believe in this personally? <Col N="971" /> During the four years, he has not met the Law Society, the Bar Council or the Court Services Board. The proposed board is still not up and running. I ask the Minister to be frank with us at this stage. If he does not believe in the idea, he ought to tell us so.

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is trying to assist inflation with figures like that. The situation is quite simple, as the Deputy well knows. There were two reports, the first of which was initiated by Deputy Rabbitte when he was Minister of State. There was a second report and we waited until it became available. When we have professional people engaged, on a voluntary basis, in giving the State the benefit of their knowledge and experience, we cannot just tell them that they must hurry up their report or that we cannot wait for it. We waited until the report was delivered and it was then assessed. The necessary consultations took place between departmental officials and the relevant agencies. The Tánaiste took a proposal to Government, from whom we got a clear endorsement and commitment. I have total commitment to it, as has the Tánaiste and the Department, and it will happen on 1 January 2002.</P>

Why did he not ensure that he got that commitment before he decided to go ahead with the PIAB? There was a golden opportunity for the Minister to nail the insurance industry down on this and commit it to it. Why did the Minister not get that commitment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Deputy means by that. Insurance is about providing cover for risks taken. The market decides the price of insurance and our job as a Government is to ensure that the measures in position assist in the delivery of protection to the people with cover particularly those who are victims of injury. That is what we are about. We hope those <Col N="972" /> measures will make a huge contribution over the next five to ten years in ensuring that insurance costs level off and are reduced. It would be fiction to say today that the insurance industry could give me a commitment that if I establish this board insurance premiums would be reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directives in 1994 European Communities (Life Assurance and Non-Life Insurance) Framework Regulations, 1994, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries and has increased choice of product to the benefit of the Irish consumer. Currently, there are 27 insurers authorised to underwrite motor insurance in Ireland &ndash; a similar number are authorised to underwrite public liability insurance cover. Fifteen companies have their headquarters in Ireland, 11 are based in other EU member states and one is a non-EU insurer. In addition, the removal of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of premiums, focusing on a number of the key cost elements. These include the costs associated with settling personal injury compensation claims and the factors contributing to the cost of premiums for compulsory motor insurance. The establishment of a personal injuries assessment board by 2002 is being pursued by an implementation group on behalf of the Government. In addition, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board will report later this year and I will take whatever further action is appropriate towards the goal of the reduction of the cost of motor insurance. In the final analysis, the pricing and underwriting of <Col N="973" /> insurance is a matter for individual companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in either.</P>

      <P>On this matter and a written reply the Minister gave me approximately six weeks ago on the last occasion we had these questions for oral answer, a question broadly similar to the one he has now answered, issued in my name and the reply issuing in the name of the Minister refused to mention that the Minister had on his desk on that occasion a copy of an interim report on the motor insurance advisory board. Why did the Minister hide the report? Why did he attempt to cover up that report which contained startling information and why did he only comment on the report when a request by a journalist in <i>The Irish Times </i>under the Freedom of Information Act achieved publication of the report? What steps is he now taking to facilitate an early completion of that report which I understand can be completed by the end of June of this year if the Minister wills it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I refute what Deputy Flanagan alleges. I established a motor insurance advisory board of 20 eminent people on coming into office. I found a board in position before that which had not met for four years. It was made up of four people, two from the insurance industry and two from the public service. That board had not met for four years. I established a new board and put 20 people on it representative of all aspects of the motor industry, consumers, young people, professional organisations and public bodies. I charged it with the responsibility to produce a report for me by 30 June last. It did not produce that report and when I sought a report I was told it did not have the necessary information and it sought an extension of time in order to produce a report for me. I told the board I was not prepared to give an extension of time unless it produced some type of report on which I could make a decision. It produced an interim report which clearly said it had inconclusive information and that it could not report factually to me. I extended the mandate of the board to 31 December 2001 and I am awaiting the report from the board. I am confident that we are making progress in this area and I will not publish any document until such time as it is factual and can be stood over by those who produce it and by me.</P>

Is it not clear from the interim report, now released under the Freedom of Information Act, that it could not get the co-operation of the industry and it did not have the power to oblige the industry to furnish the requisite information?

I established a board and am quite confident we are making progress and will get solid information and produce a good report on which I intend to take action. I cannot take action until I am given hard information which I have not got as yet. I cannot operate on the basis of invisible inconclusive evidence that will not stand up to scrutiny.

In response to Deputy Belton, I am fully aware that there are certain insurance companies in this country who are reluctant to offer cover to consumers in particular parts of the country. We have a situation under the declined cases system where if people who applied for insurance cover and were refused produce evidence to that effect we then go to the declined cases committee and it nominates cover for those people.</P>

      <P>We are unaware of any delay in communicating information to the retail sector. To-date, 178,000 copies of Getting Your Retail Business Ready for the Euro, a guide to assist Irish retailers in planning for the changeover, have been distributed by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign. It was distributed through a number of channels &ndash; by post directly to 40,000 retail outlets, by retail organisations to their members, via chambers of commerce, county and city enterprise boards, area partnerships, by five of the main commercial banks directly to their retail customers, as an insert in retail trade publications, and at presentations, exhibitions and conferences attended by the campaign.</P>
      <P>The guide outlines what will happen on -day (1 January 2002), when euro notes and coins are introduced into circulation, and the role that retailers will play in the changeover process. It includes a checklist of issues for retailers in preparing their own plan to manage the changeover, including how to convert Irish pound amounts to euro, dual display, dealing with dual circulation, staff training and advice on estimating euro cash requirements. The guide's availability continues to be advertised in the retail trade press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An easy to use computer software programme, euroFloat, was developed by the euro Changeover Board of Ireland (ECBI), and distributed since early March by both the ECBI and the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign. euroFloat helps retailers to estimate the number and denominations of euro notes and coins that they will require to enable them to give change in euro <Col N="976" /> when the new notes and coins come into circulation on 1 January 2002. The tool can also be down-loaded from the ECBI and Forfás campaign websites.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the changeover to euro cash is outlined in Ireland's cash changeover plan for 2002, which was produced by the euro Changeover Board of Ireland &ndash; ECBI &ndash; and approved by this Government. This plan was drawn up in consultation with a wide range of bodies represented on the cash changeover working group of the ECBI as well as the members of the Forfás retail working group. Organisations representing both large and small retailers are members of these two groups. With the agreement of all the organisations involved in drawing up the cash changeover plan, there is a commitment that adequate training kits for retailers will be available by 1 October next. However, the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, which has the responsibility for producing these kits, is working to have them available at an earlier date, to facilitate those retailers who indicated that they wish to carry out training over the summer months.</P>
    <P>For some retail sectors, particularly those that experience high turnover of staff, training can only be carried out closer to the time of the introduction of euro cash. Work is also under way by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign on the production of a training video which will be made available to retail organisations, chambers of commerce, etc., to assist retailers with staff training. Again it is intended that this will be available by the summer. FÁS also intends to deliver training to retail staff through a dedicated programme to be organised through its network of training centres. This will be conducted in October and November next, during the traditional retail training period.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many retailers do not have posters, leaflets, window signs, or the staff training? These have not been delivered yet. The ECBI may have them but the trade do not. There is difficulty with the changeover in information technology, accounting, the legal profession and human resources in staff training. The Minister mentioned the guide but it is only one booklet. Staff training is not taking place. Has the Minister met the ECBI to clarify the distribution of the material?

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - School Accommodation.</Title>
    <P>Mr. Deenihan: I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. There are 213 students attending St. Joseph's secondary school, Ballybunion, County Kerry. The numbers will increase as Ballybunion's population grows. The school has ten classrooms, six of which are partitioned. These are taken back for certain events, such as school mass and other assemblies. There are four corridors in the school, two of which are adequate. The other two are narrower, become congested easily and are not easily cleared. The principal and his staff are concerned that in the event of an emergency the school could not be cleared rapidly.</P>
    <P>The classrooms are inadequate. The art room has one sink and a blackboard. The deputy principal's office is used as a learning support room. The guidance office is extremely small and adjacent to a classroom with no great privacy. There is no assembly hall, canteen, library or resource room, purpose built computer room, cloak or locker room, proper art room, intercom facilities, fire alarm, reception room for teachers to meet parents or students, work space for teachers as the staffroom is small and inadequate, and no indoor physical education facilities. Physical education takes place in a yard whose surface is unsuitable for any activity. The maintenance of the building is high and, because of the structure, is expensive to heat. It is exposed to the Atlantic winds directly off the ocean as it is on a cliff edge. There is no protection from the sea or gales, especially in winter.</P>
    <P>The students have no recreational facilities. Almost 100 remain in classrooms for lunch. They have nowhere to circulate. They cannot leave the school in wet weather and so congregate in corridors and classrooms. This leads to difficulties. Occasionally furniture is damaged, such as partitions and desks. Only two rooms have solid walls. The rest have timber partitions. The principal is attempting to have the 23 galvanised panels replaced with PVC ones at £2,000 each. The floor tiles need replacing and dust extractors must be installed. Recently, some improvements took place, such as the provision of a new furnace, pipes renewed after corrosion, painting done internally and new furniture provided. These are minor and the school needs a major revamp, if not a new building.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> A proposal to provide a general purpose room, a changing room, showers and a link corridor was ready to go to tender. However, the Mercy Sisters, who left the school, provided land for a larger extension and so the school authorities revised their proposals, deciding on an extension to include the proposed facilities. The application is with the Department since May 2000. Can the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, ensure that the application is dealt with as soon as possible? Last Monday evening, with my colleague, Senator Dan Kiely, I attended a meeting of the parents who requested that a deputation meet departmental officials as soon as possible to discuss the best arrangement for the school in the future, and whether that would include a new school on a green field site. I ask the Minister for Education and Science to facilitate this meeting as soon as possible. Senator Kiely has probably already been in contact about it.</P>
    <P>All other schools in north Kerry have been either refurbished or new schools on green field sites have been provided. Ballybunion needs this school immediately. The school needs improvements.

      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding St. Joseph's secondary school, Ballybunnion.</P>
      <P>St. Joseph's, which is co-educational, is a sole provider of post-primary education in Ballybunion. The nearest other post-primary centres to it are Causeway, Listowel and Tarbert. Pupil numbers in the school have been declining in recent years, from an enrolment of 245 pupils in September 1993 to a current enrolment of 216 pupils. The Department of Education and Science records indicate that the school was built to accommodate an enrolment in the region of 250 pupils.</P>
      <P>An application from the school authorities for an extension, including a PE hall and additional specialist rooms, has been received in the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science. The school has also applied for the refurbishment of existing accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before any works can be approved, it will be necessary to carry out a long-term enrolment projection for the school. This will involve a detailed analysis of previous enrolment patterns at the school, together with projected output from primary schools in the catchment area over the next eight years. Account will be taken also of other <Col N="980" /> factors such as significant housing development, if any, which might impact on the school-going population in the area.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the examination of this application will be completed by officials in the Department of Education and Science as soon as possible, and the outcome will be notified to the school authorities. I will also take on board the Deputy's request in regard to facilitation of an early meeting with the Minister on this subject.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Special Needs Assistant Service.</Title>
    <P>Mr. Naughten: I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue. I am disappointed that there is not a representative of the Department of Education and Science in the person of the Minister or one of the two Ministers of State, given that there are two Adjournment motions on educational topics.</P>
    <P>The background to the issue is that FÁS has informed St. Michael's school in Castlerea that the community employment scheme will cease at the end of the year. St. Michael's school will not be in a position to replace personal assistants through the Department of Education and Science. The Department employs personal assistants only to support teachers in the classroom, so extracurricular work will not be able to continue.</P>
    <P>The children attending St. Michael's benefit greatly from the support of CE schemes and it would be a major loss if these were to cease. For many years the special school in Castlerea employed six personal assistants through the community employment scheme. However, FÁS has made it clear that it is not prepared to renew the contract in January 2002. What is required is a policy decision by the Minister for Education and Science to provide further support from 2002 by providing two additional full-time personal assistants. The school caters for 37 children. Without aid it would not be able to provide extracurricular activities for pupils. This would dramatically reduce the amount of attention each pupil receives within the classroom. In the long run, therefore, the investment would be extremely cost effective and should be given immediate priority.</P>
    <P>St. Michael's school provides a range of additional activities which have a very positive impact on its pupils. Many activities which have been found to be extremely valuable require additional staff. Volunteers do not know the children and can cause distress to the pupils. Without additional support, the following activities would effectively cease: swimming &ndash; 15 children need considerable help in drying themselves and <Col N="981" /> undressing; horse riding &ndash; insurance demands that six adults be present for every two children on horses; work experience &ndash; the school tries to ensure that every child over the age of 16 has a chance to get work experience and special projects such as setting up a second-hand shop, arts projects, integration programmes, gardening competitions and the Special Olympics would all have to be withdrawn if this investment is not provided.</P>
    <P>The school deals with many challenging children with various disabilities. It serves a large part of County Roscommon and the adjoining counties, including the Minister's constituency. There are many challenges, including medical and learning difficulties. Other priorities include: six children within the junior class who are not toilet trained; 33 pupils in need of self-training such as learning to dress, wash and shower themselves; 12 pupils in the senior range who are in need of basic survival training, such as crossing the road, using telephones and community involvement; six pupils of senior age who need pre-vocational training for job opportunities.</P>
    <P>The community employment scheme has had a major impact within the school. For example, one Down's syndrome boy with a bowel condition and skin irritation was so bad that he could only sit on a pillow. Having frequent sessions and constant monitoring through the support of the CE participants has meant that this child can actually go out and play in the yard. Another child from a severely disadvantaged background was left at home with no service for six years and needed help even to walk, to go to the toilet, wash, dress and eat. She had often come to school without eating, washing, changing her clothes or going to the toilet. Her needs have to be met at a very basic level before her educational requirements can even be considered.</P>
    <P>I hope this gives the Minister some insight into the type of work and challenges which the staff in St. Michael's school face every day. We have succeeded in ensuring that the service will be maintained until January 2002. However, I am seeking a commitment from the Department of Education and Science that it will support this service from January 2002. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Minister for Education and Science immediately takes action in relation to this, that there is a policy decision to support such services in special schools and that a commitment will be given from 1 January 2002 that those extracurricular activities are maintained in St. Michael's special school. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Minister for Education and Science comes down to see the service for himself. If he takes that opportunity, I am sure the additional appointments will be made.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this issue on the Adjournment. Let me outline the current position on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science involvement in the provision of special needs assistant posts to schools has a very specific focus. It is confined to the allocation of such posts to support class teachers in catering for in-school needs of children with a disability. The special needs assistant service does not extend to activities undertaken by schools outside of school hours and should not be viewed as a substitute for support previously provided under FÁS schemes.</P>
      <P>The role of special needs assistants includes: giving general assistance to class teachers under the direction of the principal teacher; preparing and tidying the classroom; assisting children to board and alight from school buses and, where necessary, travelling as an escort on school buses; giving special assistance to children with particular difficulties such as feeding, toileting and general hygiene.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, the Government decided that all children with special needs within the primary school system, including special schools, should have an automatic entitlement to the support they require to enable them to function successfully within the education system. As a result of this decision, the number of special needs assistants in the primary school system has grown from fewer than 300 in October 1998 to more than 1,700 at present.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers caters for pupils with a moderate general learning disability. It also has two classes for children with severe to profound general learning disability and two classes for children with autism. The school has a current allocation of ten special needs assistant posts. This includes two additional posts which were recently allocated to the school in line with the recent announcement of a package of measures to improve support services for children with autism. The package also included proposals to extend education services for children with autism through the month of July and the development of a nation-wide pre-school service for children with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of special needs assistant support provided by the Department of Education and Science to schools catering for children with special needs, including the school to which the Deputy refers, reflects the level of such support recommended by the Special Education Review Committee which specified particular support rates for each disability group. The Department will consider any application for an increased level of special needs assistant support where the <Col N="983" /> in-school needs of the pupils involved warrant such an increase.</P>

      <P>Before calling Deputy Fitzgerald, I consider it important to remind Members that a matter which relates to the issue under discussion is currently the subject of proceedings for a judicial review in the High Court. It is imperative in view of the <i>sub judice</i> rule that we do not refer to that case. Comments must be confined to the general matter under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to respond this issue. Keeping in mind what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said that the details of this case cannot be mentioned, I raise the question of the general policy of the Department of Defence in relation to people with minor disability given the background of this case.</P>
      <P>If a person was employed outside the Defence Forces, the questions that would be asked about an illness such as coeliac disease would be, how does this affect the person's work and could a reasonable accommodation not be made in relation to it? On the grounds of age and disability, the Defence Forces are outside the remit of the equal status legislation and can, in effect, make their own policy in these areas. Is it not reasonable, in relation to an illness like coeliac disease or minor disabilities, that these questions could be put to the Defence Forces and that, in these circumstances, it would be deemed possible for someone suffering from a minor disability such as coeliac disease to be accommodated within the Defence Forces? </P>
      <P>This type of issue raises serious questions about people's rights. In the week in which A Matter of Rights, the National Disability Authority's report on the rights of people with disability and illness was launched, it raises serious questions about how we conduct our affairs in the Defence Forces, the rights we give to people who have illnesses, whether of a minor or serious nature, and the range of legislation that is there. It clearly illustrates the need for a strong disabilities Bill which would underscore and strengthen people's rights in employment, whether in the Defence Forces or outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that a number of medical experts have said that coeliac disease can be quite a minor disability and does not preclude people from pursuing a variety of careers. Will the Minister clarify the Department's policy on this issue? Does he believe there is a need for a review of the current approach within the Defence Forces to issues such as this? Perhaps he will clarify whether he intends to bring in any reforms in this <Col N="984" /> area so that people who are rated very highly on a range of tests and aptitude tests for the Defence Forces will not be excluded because of a situation such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will understand, I do not wish to comment on details of a current High Court judicial review case which has been adjourned for further hearing to 29 May and to which the Deputy's question presumably relates and refers. The matter is before the courts and it would be entirely inappropriate for me or for any Member of this House to make comments which might be misconstrued as an attempt to influence the decision while a case is still at hearing. I will, therefore, confine myself to setting out in broad terms the reasons coeliac disease as such is seen as essentially incompatible with satisfactory military service.</P>
      <P>The professional advice of the expert medical military authority, the Director of Medical Corps, is that the special dietary requirements of a coeliac sufferer cannot be guaranteed throughout the range of possible operational circumstances which can be encountered in service. The Director of the Medical Corps issued an instruction in November 1997 with regard to the terms of application of the statutory medical classification system in so far as a wide range of specified medical conditions are concerned.</P>
      <P>In regard to coeliac disease, the director has instructed that personnel who require gluten-free diets should not be graded higher than three in respect of physical constitution. The minimum grading required in respect of physical constitution, specifically for the final approval of a recruit, is grade one. Therefore, a recruit who is diagnosed as suffering from coeliac disease cannot be finally approved. Moreover, where the condition is already diagnosed on the initial presentation of a person for recruitment, that person could not be taken on as a recruit.</P>
      <P>A grade one rating for physical constitution is required for initial enlistment on presentation of a new recruit. Confirmation of the grade one constitution is again required for final approval of the recruit at the end of the probationary period of induction. A person with grade one physical constitution is defined as having no significant impairment or disability and being considered healthy and at most requiring only routine medical surveillance and unscheduled medical care. I might add that grade one physical constitution is also required for any extension of service, beyond the initial five year period, of personnel who were recruited after 1 January 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When military personnel are deployed in military units on operational duty which can last for quite a period of time, there can be no guarantee of the continual supply of any essential dietary <Col N="985" /> requirements. Many events can overtake such supply operations resulting in cut-offs or interruptions to supplies and, in the case of coeliac disease sufferers, such an interference with supply could have very detrimental effects and very serious consequences. Medical advice is that, in the case of coeliac disease, future health is dependent on compliance with a gluten-free diet. Such a diet cannot be readily accommodated or guaranteed within the Defence Forces rations scales, particularly in circumstances such as sea-going duties, collective field training and overseas services which are the norm for young soldiers and sailors.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time I have had to deal with circumstances which, in the normal run in most professional and working activity, one would find reasonably acceptable. The medical corps in the Defence Forces goes to enormous lengths to try to ensure that those serving in the Defence Forces, because of the constraints in their work, are not suffering from an illness or a problem which may not be able to be managed in given circumstances. Having said that, there is always room for new considerations in light of they way thinking has advanced. I am quite happy to undertake to have that review because it is something which I am anxious to do across the board. I am not saying it would make a difference in a particular case or in general given the nature of the work. The Deputy has been to the Glen Of Imaal and has seen the operations there and has been on the United Nations' mandated missions. In East Timor personnel are out all night and do not know when they will get back. A bridge may be down and there may be many different circumstances arising. Obviously, the medical corps is anxious to ensure that the health of personnel is guaranteed. The word &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; is being used advisedly to try to see if that can be done. It is a matter which I will take into consideration in the general review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to address this issue which is very important to many women and their families. The Minister for Health and Children knows of my interest in this matter as I have already put down a parliamentary question. I take this opportunity to shed some light on this very dark passage in our recent medical history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century will be remembered as a time when we in Ireland tried to confront and come to terms with the more brutal aspects of our emerging republic. Over the past decade we have shed some light on the secrets of the Catholic Church and the arrogance of the medical profession. This story, which involves so many women, is about <Col N="986" /> that combination of the power of the Church and the arrogance of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>It now appears that hundreds of Irish women, over at least a 20 year period, had to undergo this brutal, experimental operation. It has left many of them suffering permanent health problems. The operation, known as symphysiotomy, was carried out &ndash; as far as we can determine &ndash; in Dublin maternity hospitals between 1944 and 1964, and it could have gone on as late as 1975. Evidence is emerging which suggests it was also carried out in a number of Cork hospitals.</P>
    <P>The operation &ndash; and the details are not for the squeamish &ndash; involved sawing through the woman's pelvis so that it opened like a hinge. International medical experts repeatedly criticised this practice. They stated that caesarean section should have been the preferred option for difficult pregnancies. Some Irish doctors persisted with symphysiotomy, because they apparently believed that women who underwent caesarean section would use contraception to avoid pregnancy. The use of contraception, of course, conflicted with the prevailing Catholic ethos.</P>
    <P>These claims are made by a UCD researcher, Ms Jacqueline Morrissey. Most of these procedures took place in Holles Street and the Coombe hospitals and there is now a claim that some took place in the Rotunda. Some in the medical profession are now seeking to justify this practice by claiming that caesarean sections were not safe at that time. Ms Morrissey has discovered a letter from one of the most enthusiastic advocates of symphysiotomy, Doctor Alex Spain, which states that caesarean sections were safe. He added:</P>
    <P>It will, however be a long time before such a method of delivery will be accepted by the profession or by the community at large . . . The result will be contraception, the mutilating operation of sterilisation and marital difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore, that Catholic dogma was dictating medical practice at this time, even if the consequences for women were extremely painful.</P>
    <P>The reason I am raising this is that it affects directly one of my constituents, Mrs. Matilda Behan from Ringsend, who has gone public on the issue. She has suffered hugely since then and is now on six painkillers. She has had absolutely no compensation. What has the Department done about this? They say they have started an investigation. How long will this investigation take? Why did they not adopt a monitoring role at the time to prevent this brutal practice? I want answers and so do the women who have suffered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for raising this issue. I am aware of concerns about the practice of symphysiotomies in Irish maternity hospitals. Symphysiotomy was an obstetrical pro<Col N="987" /> cedure used by clinicians during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. It is no longer in use today.</P>
      <P>It must be stressed that this procedure was used in an era when caesarean sections carried a higher risk to the mother. Doctors did not have the technology, knowledge and expertise available today. The Deputy will appreciate that we must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in the light of current knowledge and experience. Enormous medical advances have been made in recent years and medical care and procedures were not as advanced 50 years ago as they are in Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> Notwithstanding this, in the light of the public concern about the use of symphysiotomy, the Minister has arranged for the Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health and Children to contact the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and requested it to examine the issues raised and to respond to him as soon as possible. The Minister will consider the matter further when the response of the institute becomes available and is examined by the CMO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pleased to have been the first Government to introduce national minimum wage legislation to tackle the issue of low pay. The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, came into force on 1 April 2000 and the national minimum hourly rate of pay has been set at £4.40. An ESRI impact study published in June 1999 estimated that 163,000 employees, particularly women and young workers, would benefit from the introduction of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The national minimum hourly rate of pay can be increased by ministerial order following acceptance of a recommendation contained in a national agreement. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a recommendation from the social partners to increase the national minimum hourly rate of pay to IR£4.70 on 1 July 2001 and IR£5.00 on 1 October 2002. The Government has accepted the recommendation and the Tánaiste has signed the necessary order.</P>
      <P>Where there is no national agreement in place the legislation does provide that any organisation, which is substantially representative of employees or employers, can request the Labour Court to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court cannot consider this request unless 12 months have elapsed since the Minister last declared a national minimum hourly rate of pay. In conducting such an examination the Labour Court would undertake appropriate consultations and if satisfied that there was agreement as to the appropriate hourly rate of pay, the court would make a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
      <P>In the event that there was no such agreement, the court is empowered to make a recommendation having regard to a number of factors, including the movement in earnings of employees since the Minister last declared the national minimum hourly rate of pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enforcement of the terms of the National Minimum Wage Act is now an integral part of the work of the labour inspectorate and as such all inspectors would include monitoring of com<Col N="990" /> pliance with the Act in their regular activities. Where infringements have been found they have tended to be quite minor and have been rectified as a result of the inspector's intervention.</P>

      <P>Data in respect of the enterprise development agencies IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Udarás na Gaeltachta and the county enterprise boards show that, in the period 1996 to 2000, 9,456 full-time and part-time jobs were created in the north-west region comprising counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo. Job losses in agency-supported firms over the same period totalled 8,404 while the latter figure does not include job losses in county enterprise board firms, the extent of such losses is not significant. The downsizing of the Fruit of the Loom operations in County Donegal has had a significant negative impact on the figures for the region in this period.</P>
      <P>However, these figures alone do not reveal the full employment picture. The CSO labour force survey and quarterly national household survey shows that total numbers at work in the Border midlands and west &ndash; BMW &ndash; region increased from 351,000 in April 1997 to 424,000 in November 2000, an increase of more than 20%. During the same period, the unemployment rate in the BMW region fell from 10.5% to 4.8%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's agencies are now pursuing a more focused regional policy, and it is notable that during 2000 more than 50% of all greenfield jobs secured by IDA Ireland were agreed for the BMW region. Enterprise Ireland has also developed a comprehensive approach to the <Col N="992" /> achievement of balanced regional economic development.</P>
    <P>Provision of appropriate infrastructure will be a key factor in the continued development of the enterprise sector. Proper and planned investment can help to minimise regional imbalances and create opportunities for all the regions to share in our continuing economic growth. The Government's commitment to the provision of regional infrastructure is evidenced by the investment programme set out in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In relation to roads, the national development plan provides that, as well as the upgrading of the five major inter-urban routes, significant improvements will be carried out on other major national primary routes, including the routes to the north-west comprising the N2, N3, N4 and N5. The National Roads Authority, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, is pursuing the detailed programming of this work and will determine appropriate road types based on a roads needs study and on current and projected traffic growth. Preliminary work is also under way on substantial improvements to the N13, N14, N15, N16 which serve the north west.</P>
    <P>Regarding mainline rail, the priorities of the NDP are to upgrade the infrastructure, rolling stock and facilities. The main areas of concentration for this investment are the inter-city passenger services including those on the Dublin-Sligo line.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Department of Public Enterprise that the development of cross-Border rail links was discussed at the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on transport last December. The council identified a number of opportunities for co-operation, including the further development of cross-Border rail and bus services, and asked that the joint secretariat convene meetings of officials to prepare a detailed work programme for consideration by the Council. I also understand from Iarnród Éireann that Northern Ireland Railways plans to reduce travel times between Derry and Belfast by routing trains onto the Antrim-Bleach Green line, which is a more direct route to Belfast than the current route via Lisburn. When this line is brought into use, the Derry train will terminate at Belfast Central Station thus allowing for direct connections with the enterprise services to Dublin.</P>
    <P>These developments should significantly enhance rail travel opportunities between the Donegal-Derry area and Dublin.</P>

      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the national authority for occupational safety and health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by the Health and Safety Authority and is therefore obtainable directly from the authority.</P>
      <P>I have, however, been informed by the authority that there were 23 construction-related fatalities in 2000, while three construction related fatal accidents have been reported to the authority this year to date. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to date to the Health and Safety Authority, for 2000, is 1,087.</P>
      <P>The management of health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and awareness-raising coupled with a partnership approach. There is a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed and this legislation is enforced in a pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority. The additional resources, both financial and staffing, which I have secured for the authority, are being put to good effect in the construction sector through targeted inspection, enforcement and awareness-raising activities.</P>
      <P>However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in the construction sector, a strong partnership approach &ndash; by all the parties at all levels in the sector &ndash; to the issue of safety must be adopted. This partnership approach was further developed and strengthened in 2000 in the context of the construction safety partnership &ndash; CSP &ndash; which includes representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU.</P>
      <P>The report of the CSP sets out a detailed three year partnership plan to improve occupational safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry, and the parties to the plan have made a number of wide-ranging commitments which they have undertaken to implement over that period of time.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the partnership plan cover measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training, introduction of safety management systems and increased inspection activity by the Health and Safety Authority. Work is continuing this year on implementing the recommendations of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> I look forward to receiving shortly the report recording progress over the first year of the partnership plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 71 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 13,316 redundancies were notified to my Department in 2000. A further 3,970 redundancies were notified in the first three months of 2001.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing jobs which are particularly vulnerable in Ireland are those in relatively low skill areas, where openness to external competitiveness pressures is greatest. Many of the recently announced major job losses in overseas-owned plants in Ireland arise from restructuring, with activities at the lower end of the value-added chain being phased out as they become uneconomic.</P>
      <P>The focus of our efforts to limit job losses will continue to be towards helping indigenous companies improve their competitive position in global markets, and encouraging foreign-owned firms to become more deeply embedded in the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>While there have been some job losses in the information technology related sectors, overall our base of companies in this sector is relatively young and focused on higher value products, often incorporating functions, such as customer-technical support, software development and logistics, which make them less vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The State development agencies have ongoing contact with companies experiencing difficulties, including, where appropriate, contact by myself and the agencies with parent companies.</P>
      <P>In cases where job losses occur, the various State agencies will continue to work closely with all the interests involved with a view to attracting replacement projects and expanding existing businesses.</P>
      <P>In addition FÁS provides a range of training and retraining courses, and placement facilities for people affected by closures and arrangements are in place to ensure that its support structures move in rapidly and systematically in instances where major lay-offs occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 21, 41 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying, which I recently launched, is a comprehensive examination of the issue of workplace bullying.</P>
      <P>The task force had three basic terms of reference which were to identify the size of the problem and the sectors most at risk; to develop practical programmes and strategies to prevent workplace bullying; and to produce a co-ordinated response from the State agencies.</P>
      <P>A key element for any informed debate is the necessity to have national data on the nature, scope and scale of the problem. To fully meet the first term of reference, the task force commissioned an independent national survey on workplace bullying. This national survey was carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute. The survey represents a significant component of the task force report capturing as it does a full picture of the incidence and characteristics of workplace bullying in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The findings of this survey, including the finding that a total of 7.0% of those currently in the workforce record themselves as having been bullied in the six months preceding the survey, will enable both the State and individual enterprises and employers to undertake appropriate and targeted actions.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the issue of workplace bullying, and taking full account of all of the findings of the ESRI survey, the task force has determined that the prevention of, and the response to, workplace bullying is something that requires action and involvement at both State level and at enterprise level. In this regard the task force has made a number of wide-ranging recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal recommendations relating to action at State level include the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency, the introduction of codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the <Col N="997" /> establishment of an advisory committee on workplace bullying under the auspices of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>In arriving at a recommendation to introduce and develop codes of practice, the task force examined the various provisions of existing employment legislation and considered the need or desirability for new or amending dedicated anti-bullying legislation. However, the task force considered that the existing legislation was comprehensive and that it would be premature at this stage to expand on that legislation until it had been fully and properly utilised.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the codes of practice will be to provide guidance on putting in place policies and procedures at the level of individual enterprises, and as a basis and a reference point for the relevant State agencies, that is the Health and Safety Authority, the Equality Authority and the Labour Relations Commission, charged with offering advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee will have a key role in co-ordinating and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations relating to the State's role in responding to workplace bullying, including the promotion of the three codes of practice. The proposed membership of the advisory committee will include representation from the main State agencies and bodies currently dealing with workplace equality, welfare and labour relations issues, in addition to IBEC and ICTU.</P>
    <P>The board of the Health and Safety Authority has adopted the task force report and its recommendations and I have been informed by the authority that steps have been taken to set up the advisory committee. Nominations for membership of the committee will be sought shortly from relevant parties. I have asked all parties to the recommendations to advance their implementation as soon as possible. In particular, I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and to the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission and to the chairman of the Health and Safety Authority, asking that the codes of practice, which are to be developed under their areas of responsibility, be completed as a matter of urgency. I have indicated that I would like to see codes finalised within three months.</P>
    <P>I would also ask individual employers and enterprises to take on board the recommendations in the report which directly concern them, and to put in place, appropriate anti-bullying measures without delay. In particular, I encourage all employers, as a practical first step, to adopt the dignity at work charter recommended by the task force.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report and its conclusions and recommendations. I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations will, in the long-term, have a positive impact in addressing the issue of workplace bullying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to about £5.064 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of civil service staff who are working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations are being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
      <P>Of this amount, the cost of the inquiries into National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, which are being undertaken by High Court inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, currently stands at about £3 million. None of this has yet been recovered from the two companies. As I have indicated previously, I intend to request the High Court the full recoupment from the companies concerned of these costs on completion of the inquiries.</P>
      <P>Of the balance of £2.064 million, the principal areas of expenditure have been incurred on the investigations of Ansbacher, Cayman Limited, £1.35 million, Bula Resources Holdings plc, £204,000, Faxhill Homes Limited, £207,000, IIB Bank Limited, £88,000, and various other section 19 investigations, £45,000. The sum also includes £170,000 in respect of the State's portion of the costs of liquidating the group of companies associated with the Clonmannon retirement village. In this communication, the Commission states that the national officials responsible for co-ordinating the changeover to the euro, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, in the case of this country, were consulted when the report was being drawn up. Part 3 of the report, pp 41-42, addresses the risk of price increases across the eurozone during the changeover and concludes that, on the whole, the risk is very low. The report suggests several lines of preventive action which could be pursued in order to reassure consumers, &ldquo;without calling into question the principle of the freedom to set prices, which is one of the essential foundations of the Single Market&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that it so happens we in Ireland have already taken on board key suggestions contained in the report as regards dual pricing, a special logo and price surveys. The voluntary commitments in that connection are to be found in the action plan 2000-2001, to protect consumers as far as possible against unwarranted price rises during the changeover to <Col N="999" /> the euro, which I launched last December and which is being implemented by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Needless to say, the secretariat of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland was consulted when the action plan was being prepared. In Ireland the special logo will be available from the Director of Consumer Affairs. Display of the logo means that the businesses concerned are publicly committed to carrying out the changeover fairly, without seeking any advantage from the conversion. Consumers should be able to feel confident that they will not be overcharged for goods or services where they see the logo on display. The Deputy may be interested to know that consumers can contact the Director of Consumer Affairs with queries or complaints they may have on the euro at odcaeuroinfo@entemp.ie.</P>
    <P>Going beyond national level, the idea of a voluntary commitment to overall price stability appears in the joint statement adopted on 2 April 2001 by representatives of the retail trades, SMEs and consumers in the eurozone: &ldquo;Retailers undertake not to use the changeover to the euro to apply hidden price rises. They undertake to do their utmost to ensure the overall stability of their prices when converting them into euros and to publicise these commitments using appropriate communication tools. In order to reflect this commitment and to get the message across to consumers, they will use the European slogan &ldquo;new currency, stable prices&rdquo; as much as possible in all appropriate contexts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The full text of the joint statement is included at annex 3 to the report attached to the Commission communication.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing information, I am sure the Deputy will already have drawn the logical conclusion that with regard to the changeover to the euro, neither price freezes nor price curtailments during the early part of 2002 are under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 52, 60, 75 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>While the US economy has slowed down, impacting directly on the global economy, it is not clear at this stage how severe or protracted this slow down will prove to be. Obviously, a sharp and prolonged slowdown could have significant effects on Ireland as on all trading economies. This would be particularly true if the slow down substantially reduces the inflow of foreign direct investment or results in a sharp depreciation of the dollar and sterling against the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are now a range of factors at work which will help to ameliorate the effects of any slowdown in the US economy. These include economic conditions within the EU are, in contrast to the US, still strong &ndash; since this is the main market for the output of US owned companies in Ireland; Irish operations are somewhat less likely to be affected by any slowdown than those in the US; much of the recent foreign investment into Ireland from the US has been in the form of strategic investments designed to operate under new management structures and achieve better efficiencies and margins than US plants &ndash; such operations would probably be least likely to experience job cuts; a large part of the recent weakness in the US economy has been confined to the IT sector &ndash; while this sector is very important to Ireland it is by no means the only significant sector in terms of US owned investment in Ireland; in the event of a continuous slowdown in the US economy, the most vulnerable jobs in US multinationals in Ireland are likely to be those in relatively low skill areas &ndash; these jobs are, in the long-term, at risk anyway, from competition from low wage economies; in this respect a primary element of current IDA Ireland policy is to assist client companies to move up the value chain into higher tech jobs, requiring higher skilled, and better paid <Col N="1001" /> employees. This should help to secure employment levels in FDI firms into the future.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the Irish economy, with very low unemployment and strong demand for labour in most sectors, means that Ireland is in a better position than it would have been in the past to weather the effects of any economic slowdown in the US and global economies.</P>
    <P>Many forecasters see a recovery in the US economy setting in and continued buoyancy elsewhere during the second half of 2001, and I am confident that this will, in fact, be the case. Indeed, IDA Ireland still hopes to create about 12,000 new jobs in 2001. While this is not as strong as the record breaking 2000 figure, it is still high by historical standards.</P>
    <P>The impact of a downturn in the Chinese economy would be minimal from an FDI perspective as there is only one IDA Ireland assisted Chinese company based in Ireland at the moment, employing 12 people.</P>
    <P>In respect of the economy as a whole, the potential impact of a Chinese downturn would not appear to be significant. Total exports to China from all sectors of the economy, which stood at IR£114.755 million for the period January to November 2000, represent only a small percentage of total trade, IR£59.318 billion during the same period.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that arising from positive Government actions the economy is now in a much more robust condition to weather the vagaries of the global economic cycle and that foreign direct investment will continue to play a key role in our economic success.</P>
    <P>Trade statistics of Ireland provided by the Central Statistics Office. Certain other reports, received by the inspectorate more recently, concerned workers engaged in activities connected with the agricultural sector. In view of the very serious concerns generated as a result of the foot and mouth crisis, however, it was deemed prudent that inspectors should not engage in any activity which would bring them in contact with this sector. With the relaxations now in place these outstanding reports are receiving priority attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment agencies, submissions have been sought on a review of the relevant legislation from the social partners and from other interested parties, for example, the Irish Federation of Personnel Services. When the views of all are to hand, we will meet with the interested groups and prepare proposals on options open to us. Such options could include the amendment of the 1971 Act or the introduction of a code of practice that would involve self-regulation by the sector. Advice from the Attorney General's office will also be necessary. I expect to complete the review during the second half of this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> While on the topic of employment agencies I would like to mention also that my inspectorate undertook an exercise targeted at that sector recently. The results of that campaign did not yield evidence of any malpractices by those interviewed. However, it is a sector to which the inspectorate plans to turn its attention once again, shortly.</P>
    <P>The remit of the labour inspectorate is to ensure workers receive their minimum statutory entitlements. In this regard the inspectorate can pursue allegations of workers being subjected to excessive working hours, illegal deductions e.g., excessive accommodation fees, non-payment of compensation for Sunday working or of holiday-public holiday pay, etc. However, a theme of complaint that has been identified concerns the reneging on the pay terms and other working conditions offered to the immigrant worker before departure from his or her home country. There are some indications also that recruitment fees are being sought at the point of origin. This presents us with a problem of jurisdictional responsibility. In addition, there can be difficulties which fall within the scope of contract law and are not the province of the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Employment Agency Act, 1971, permits employment agencies to charge placement fees to the employers for whom they source foreign workers but it precludes them from charging the individual workers fees for seeking employment for them. In this connection, possibilities for administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries are being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of foreign workers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the administrative procedures for the issue of work permits have been examined carefully so as to better protect the employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned. A particular initiative aimed at addressing part of the current problem is the preparation of an explanatory document setting out the essential elements of Irish employment rights legislation and protections for workers. This document, which will be presented in a range of languages, will in future accompany all application forms for work permits. The work permits application form will also have to be signed by the prospective employee.</P>
    <P>I am already on record as saying that I do not intend to preside over a situation whereby a small number of employers will be allowed to get away with the exploitation of vulnerable people. I unreservedly condemn any abuses of the statutory employment rights and protections to which immigrant workers may have been subjected. Such unscrupulous employers can take note that <Col N="1003" /> I am determined that they will be pursued and dealt with appropriately.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The intra-corporate transfer facility is one of a number of changes to the arrangements governing work permits which was agreed between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and this Department in April, 1999.</P>
      <P>The intra-corporate transfer facility allows existing employees, who are posted for a maximum period of four years to an establishment or undertaking in Ireland that is owned by a company or group which has operations in more than one State, to work in Ireland without requiring a work permit. It is a practical step that permits employees in a particular company to transfer for a limited period of time without having to go through further administrative procedures. Such internal secondments are a routine and essential feature of most multi-nationals' operations.</P>
      <P>Any company, foreign or indigenous, that seeks to bring in new employees must first seek to source such employees within Ireland or the EEA, European Economic Area. When reasonable efforts have been made to do so but without success, the company may seek employees outside the EEA. In these instances, a work permit must be applied for to employ a non-EEA national. Foreign companies, located here, seeking to bring in non-EEA nationals, who are not already working with the company abroad, must also apply for a work permit for the said individual. There is no comparison between this scenario and the intra-corporate transfer facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> The intra-corporate facility does not require case by case sanction from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, at the point of entry an immigration officer or Garda registration officer must of course be satisfied that a person seeking to avail of the facility does in fact qualify.</P>

      <P>Figures published by the CSO at the beginning of April indicate that there were 39 strikes and 97,046 man-days lost in 2000 compared with 32 strikes and 215,587 man-days lost in 1999. While the reduction in man-days lost during 2000 is a positive development, I am concerned at the extent of industrial action currently taking place.</P>
      <P>The State provides dispute resolution facilities to assist the parties resolve their differences through agreed procedures.

      <P>There has been a high level of adherence to the industrial peace and stabilisation clause of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Notwithstanding this there have been cases in both the public and private sectors where industrial action has occurred which is in breach of the PPF.</P>

      <P>Adherence to industrial peace has been underpinned by a national implementation body representing Government, IBEC, CIF and ICTU which will meet quarterly to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of PPF.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has specific responsibility for providing information to assist businesses with their preparations for the changeover to the euro. The EMU business awareness campaign, which is managed by Forfás at the request of this Department, has undertaken this task since it was launched in December 1996. To date, the campaign has produced a comprehensive range of publications of relevance to all sectors of the Irish economy which have been widely disseminated to Irish businesses.</P>
      <P>As regards the general lack of information, a survey conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in December 2000 on behalf of the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, shows that 72% of all Irish firms have received information on the changeover and have expressed high levels of satisfaction with the information received. However, it is clear from the same research that a considerable number of firms have yet to act on the information provided, particularly in the case of SME firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the start of this year, as we move into the final phase of the changeover, the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, has significantly increased its activities. Specific activities have included: a major advertising campaign using television, radio, press and trade publications, with Internet advertising to follow shortly; new guidelines to assist retailers in planning for the changeover, of which 178,000 copies have been distributed through a wide variety of channels including direct distribution by post to 40,000 retailers; presentations on the relevant EMU planning issues for business at meetings, conferences and/or seminars of professional, trade and business organisations, particularly those that <Col N="1006" /> represent companies in the SME sector; exhibition stands at appropriate conferences, trade and business exhibitions that facilitate dissemination of campaign messages, particularly to companies in the SME sector; articles-features in relevant publications, newsletters and journals of trade, business and professional organisations particularly those focused on companies in the SME sector. In addition, the campaign will continue with its joint information initiative with Running Your Business, the magazine of the Small Firms Association which is circulated to a dedicated list of 30,000 small firms; a LoCall help-line to assist businesses with their queries regarding changeover issues; a national conference on the euro, which was held in Loughrea, County Galway, that highlighted the changeover experiences of the SME firms involved in the Loughrea euro town project as they switched to euro-based trading. The Loughrea project, which has been run under the auspices of the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, has identified many practical issues for SMEs in preparing for the euro.</P>
    <P>In addition to the campaign's ongoing tasks, other specific activities planned by the campaign for the remainder of the changeover period will include: information will be prepared and distributed to SMEs, in a comprehensive new guide to be published shortly, covering key areas of preparation including accounting, software, payroll, revenue and other issues; production of a training pack for retailers for the purpose of staff training: this will be distributed to every retailer in the country during the summer.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of each firm to ensure that they are able to conduct their business in euro from 1 January 2002 and the EMU business awareness campaign can only assist in providing the necessary information that will assist them to do this. We are satisfied that the necessary information has been, and continues to be, provided to Irish businesses to facilitate them with this task.</P>

      <P>My Department is the designated managing authority for two of <Col N="1007" /> the operational programmes under the national development plan. These are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme.</P>
      <P>The objectives and strategies outlined in the national development plan, which relate to my Department, were drawn up in close consultation with Government Departments and the implementing agencies, which include Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and FÁS. The operational programmes are monitored by their respective monitoring committees. My Department chairs both the monitoring committees for the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme. The first annual reports on the operational programmes will cover the year 2000. These reports are being compiled at present and are due to be considered by the monitoring committees later this month. Expenditure under the employment and human resources development operational programme in 2000 amounted to some 1.64 billion, or 72 % of the forecast for the year. Expenditure under the productive sector operational programme in 2000 amounted to some 229 million or 28% of the forecast for the year.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual for expenditure in the first year of such programmes to be less than the forecast and there are a number of valid reasons for this. For example, there was a considerable delay in a number of areas under the productive sector operational programme in obtaining State aid approval from the European Commission. Also, there is inevitably a time-lag from the launch of schemes to the receipt and evaluation of proposals and the incurring of expenditure. It should also be remembered that expenditure was still continuing in 2000 in respect of commitments made up to the end of 1999 under the previous round of operational programmes.</P>
      <P>Targets have been put in place to measure the progress of the operational programmes at mid-term in 2003 and on completion in 2006. I am confident that over the period of the plan, the targets for both programmes are realistic and achievable. Both programmes will be subject to ongoing independent evaluation to ensure they remain focused and on target.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 49, 51 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the ongoing concern with regard to the treatment by a small number of employers of certain non-nationals placed in employment here on foot of work permit applications. I can confirm also that officials of my Department have met with trade union representatives who have provided specific information with regard to alleged abuses of non-national employees in particular employments.</P>
      <P>The protections of Irish labour law apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as to native Irish workers. It is a fundamental tenet of my Department's approach to employment rights that the statutory rights and entitlements of all who work in Ireland will continue to be assured and enforced and that effective mechanisms by which they can vindicate their legal rights will be provided. In this regard the labour inspectorate of my Department has an ongoing responsibility for monitoring the employment conditions of various categories of vulnerable workers, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate, in conducting its enforcement responsibilities across all sectors of the economy under the relevant labour legislation, operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation whatsoever with respect to nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> The labour inspectorate has been engaged in carrying out a number of investigations over the last few months, including those concerning placements in the nursing, hotel and catering sectors. It is a feature of these activities that one avenue of examination can in turn lead to yet another fresh direction for investigation. As such these particular investigations are still ongoing but will end soon.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, a significant volume of material has been gathered already and it is anticipated that decisions as to possible prosecutions will be concluded within the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>Certain other reports, received by the Inspectorate more recently, concerned workers engaged in activities connected with the agricultural sector. In view of the very serious concerns generated as a result of the foot and mouth crisis, however, it was deemed prudent that inspectors should not engage in any activity which would bring them in contact with this sector. With the relaxations now in place these outstanding reports are receiving priority attention.</P>

When the views of all are to hand, we will meet with the interested groups and prepare proposals on options open to us. Such options could include the amendment of the 1971 Act or the introduction of a code of practice that would involve self-regulation by the sector. Advice from the Attorney General's office will also be necessary. I expect to complete the review during the second half of this year.</P>

In addition, there can be difficult<Col N="1010" /> ies which fall within the scope of contract law and are not the province of the inspectorate.</P>

      <P>In this communication, the Commission states that the national officials responsible for coordinating the changeover to the euro, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, in the case of this country, were consulted when the report was being drawn up. Part 3 of the report, pp 41-42, addresses the risk of price increases across the eurozone during the changeover and concludes that, on the whole, the risk is very low. The report suggests several lines of preventive action which could be pursued in order to reassure consumers, &ldquo;without calling into question the principle of the freedom to set prices, which is one of the essential foundations of the Single Market&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that it so happens we in Ireland have already taken on board key suggestions contained in the report as regards dual pricing, a special logo and price surveys: The voluntary commitments in that connection are to be found in the action plan, 2000-01, to protect consumers as far as possible against unwarranted price rises during the changeover to the euro, which I launched last December and which is being implemented by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Needless to say, the secretariat of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland was consulted when the action plan was being prepared. In Ireland the special logo will be available from the Director of Consumer Affairs. Display of the logo means that the businesses concerned are publicly committed to carrying out the changeover fairly, without seeking any advantage from the conversion. Consumers should be able to feel confident that they will not be overcharged for goods or services where they see the logo on display. The Deputy may be interested to know that consumers can contact the Director of Consumer Affairs with queries or complaints they may have on the euro at odcaeuroinfo@entemp.ie.</P>
      <P>Going beyond national level, the idea of a voluntary commitment to overall price stability appears in the joint statement adopted on 2 April 2001 by representatives of the retail trades, SMEs and consumers in the eurozone: &ldquo;Retailers undertake not to use the changeover to the euro to apply hidden price rises. They undertake to do their utmost to ensure the overall stability of their prices when converting them into euros and to publicise these commitments using appropriate communication tools. In order to reflect this commitment and to get the message across to consumers, they will use the European slogan &ldquo;new currency, stable prices&rdquo; as much as possible in all appropriate contexts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The full text of the joint statement is included at annex 3 to the report attached to the Commission Communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> In the light of the foregoing information, I am sure the Deputy will already have drawn the logical conclusion that with regard to the changeover to the euro, neither price freezes nor price curtailments during the early part of 2002 are under consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 34 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness and Mahon, Ireland, Limited, Hamilton Ross Co. Limited. and Kentford Securities Limited. The examinations of Celtic Helicopters Limited. and Kentford Securities Limited are well advanced, and I expect to receive reports on these companies in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Reports on Bula Resources, Holdings, plc, Garuda Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration.</P>
      <P>In the case of Bula Resources, Holdings, plc I have decided, based on legal advice received, not to proceed with summary prosecutions against the directors and/or the company for suspected breaches of the Companies Acts identified in the report. I have recently referred the report to the Criminal Assets Bureau for such action as is deemed appropriate and have also referred it to the Company Law Review Group for consideration of certain matters arising out of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July the High Court quashed my decision to examine the books and documents of Dunnes <Col N="1013" /> Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores, ILAC Centre, Limited. An appeal has been lodged on my behalf with the Supreme Court and will be heard on 2 July, 2001.</P>
    <P>Three High Court inquiries are being undertaken into National Irish Bank, Limited, NIB, and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and Ansbacher, Cayman, Limited. The two NIB-related inquiries are expected to conclude with a report to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The High Court Inquiry into Ansbacher, Cayman, Limited, is continuing its work. The four inspectors were recently represented at a hearing in the Cayman Islands, where they supported the application by Ansbacher, Cayman, Limited to the Court for leave to provide the Inspectors with certain information. The decision of the Chief Justice of the Cayman Islands on the matter is currently pending. Subject to the completion of all current and potential future legal proceedings, they hope to have their final report completed and lodged with the High Court by the end of 2001. Some 29 summonses have been issued against Faxhill Homes Limited and its directors in respect of various breaches of the Companies Acts. The defendants have pleaded guilty to three offences under section 91, register of debenture holders, of the Companies Act, 1963. The case will resume in Naas District Court on 21 May next.</P>

      <P>The review was also to provide an indication of necessary staffing levels and the final report contained a central recommendation that the staffing complement of the authority be increased to 44. Prior to the review, the authorised complement was 24 and following an interim report by the consultants, I increased the complement by two senior economists and three legal advisers to 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> The 15 additional posts are recommended over a range of grades and within these it is recommended that three gardaí should be appointed to the Competition Authority to assist in its enforcement work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to a changing dynamic in the Irish and global economies and in the light of changed conditions arising from our national success over the past decade IDA Ireland has recently completed an extensive strategic review of its current mission and strategy. Arising from this review it has initiated a new strategy for the agency going forward until 2010.</P>
      <P>The strategy will include the continuation of FDI with existing and new niches of business while aiming to generate more clusters of world-class industries. IDA Ireland will however focus more on knowledge based developments than on cost-based investments. The agency has also proposed the establishment of regional economic centres at key locations which have not seen the full benefit of growth that other major centres have experienced. The agency will continue with the target of doubling the number of jobs from greenfield projects in the Objective One, Border, midland and west regions. In addition to these strands IDA Ireland will work with and influence the educational establishment, relevant institutions and companies to facilitate the development of skills, research and innovation in a manner which will ensure that industry gains critical, differentiated competitive advantages internationally over the coming years.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland believes a key strategic priority for coming years will include the agency being more effective in regions so that regional centres become magnets which will attract and entice investment and development. It proposes to do this initially by moving additional staff to three regional economic centres. The agency proposes locating a senior manager and a significant unit of IDA Ireland in each centre and will use the brand strength of the agency to give leadership to development efforts in the centres in question. This is part of IDA's strategy to continue to maximise impact at a regional level.</P>
      <P>The major centres proposed by the agency to be the focus of this shift in resources are Athlone, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
      <P>Athlone will become the headquarters for regional activity and will also become home for the health care division and property management division. Approximately 30 posts will be transferred to Athlone from Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> Sligo will have parts of the international services and the engineering and consumer divisions located there with approximately 15 posts being transferred from Dublin.</P>
    <P>Parts of the engineering, consumer and information and communication technology divisions will be located in Waterford with approximately 15 posts being transferred from Dublin.</P>
    <P>When completed, IDA Ireland will have 95 staff across all of its regional offices and the underlying purpose will be to work in close partnership with the other state and local resources to create a drive from within the regions to pull in foreign investment rather than the present approach of pushing it from its Dublin headquarters. The agency will also be looking at niches where there is potential for Ireland to become the number one player and shift the focus from individual projects to a cluster dynamic.</P>
    <P>In addition to these new elements IDA Ireland will continue to deliver new, higher value added and replacement jobs. The agency will also work with existing companies to assist them in upgrading their activities and integrate them more deeply in the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>A projected overall figure for job losses in 2001 is not available. However, it is hoped that the job creation efforts in 2001 by the three major state development agencies, i.e. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development will result in a net increase of about 17,000 jobs in companies supported by those agencies.</P>
      <P>There is a wide range of financial and other supports available from the State agencies to encourage the promotion and expansion of industry and to counter the adverse effects of job losses. These supports are designed to help firms improve their competitiveness in an increasingly global economy. The agencies are particularly focused on achieving more balanced job creation on a regional basis, and considerable resources are being deployed for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The package of taxation and company law measures introduced by us in 1999 and 2000 to address problems arising from the use of Irish registered non resident companies &ndash; IRNR's &ndash; for undesirable purposes, provide that all companies have to be linked more closely to the State and interface more fully with the Revenue Commissioners and the Registrar of Companies, in compliance with a range of new requirements in company and taxation law.</P>
      <P>The key change is in the taxation area as a result of which all companies registered under the Companies Acts are now regarded as being resident in the State for tax purposes, except for companies meeting specific criteria specified in the Finance Act, 1999. The effect of this is that the IRNR structure is no longer generally available. Going forward, therefore, only companies meeting Revenue's criteria can qualify for the IRNR status under the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
      <P>In relation to the position of companies in existence prior to the coming into operation of the new measures Revenue has written to approximately 80,000 such companies. These are companies which are incorporated in the State but which had not made contact with Revenue for the purposes of registering for tax.</P>
      <P>Approximately 35,000 of these companies have been struck off the Companies Office register, either voluntarily or on foot of that Office's procedures. 1,100 companies have been struck off the register following notification, under the 1999 Finance Act provisions, to the registrar by Revenue that the companies had failed to furnish Revenue with the required information. In addition, Revenue has recently forwarded to the registrar a further list of 7,000 companies which have failed to furnish Revenue with information. The registrar has commenced strike-off proceedings against these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 16,500 companies have registered for tax while 6,000 companies have given the required information to Revenue but have indicated that they have not commenced trading. <Col N="1019" /> The position of the remaining companies remains under consideration by Revenue.</P>
    <P>There is no information available in the Companies Office on the number of IRNR's. Essentially, an IRNR is a company which is incorporated in Ireland under Irish company law but which is not deemed to be resident here for tax purposes because it qualifies for the exceptions provided in the 1999 Finance Act. Consequently, Revenue alone determines which companies incorporated under the Companies Acts qualifies for IRNRs status under the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Last year, 41,217 companies in total were struck off the register in comparison to 37,850 companies struck off in 1999. The number of companies struck off the register in the first four months this year, was 2,521.</P>
    <P>While I have seen newspaper reports in recent months in relation to alleged illegal activity by IRNRs, our Department has no direct involvement in any of these cases. It was the potential damage, which such activity had that prompted the Government to take the measures that I have already described and which have so far borne the results outlined.</P>
    <P>I assure this House that the current legislative measures will continue to be effectively enforced through the ongoing co-operative efforts on the part of Revenue and the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, when established, to ensure that the IRNR problem is eliminated over time.</P>

      <P>Although the extent of the slow-down in the US economy is not yet fully known, it is clear that <Col N="1020" /> competition in the US market will be greater in the immediate future than it has been.</P>
      <P>It is likely that the medium &ndash; to low-technology sectors in particular will find it more difficult to sell to US industry. Some consolidation among Irish customers in the US is likely, and this may tighten the market further.</P>
      <P>However, the US market will continue to offer huge opportunities for Irish exporters generally, and particularly in the high-technology field. In this sector, Irish exporters are generally focused on efficiency related products and services, which have been less affected by the slow-down.</P>
      <P>Feedback from companies assisted by Enterprise Ireland suggests that they are maintaining their planned levels of business and the most recent statistics for exports to the US support this, as they demonstrate that exports to the US continued to grow up to the end of 2000. If, as is expected, the US economy begins to recover in the second half of the year this position is likely to improve.</P>
      <P>Job losses announced in IDA Ireland assisted companies and which are directly related to the downturn total about 1,200 to date. In addition some of the major multi-nationals have temporarily halted recruitment or slowed the build-up of planned expansions.</P>
      <P>Overall, IDA Ireland hopes to create about 12,000 new jobs in 2001, which is not as strong as in 2000 but is still high by historical standards.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the national development plan, and in particular the roll-out of infrastructure to the regions, and measures taken to ensure the adequate supply of skilled labour will help to maintain the competitiveness of Ireland as an attractive investment location.</P>

      <P>Community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; is a work experience programme whose primary role is to assist the progression of participants into jobs and/or further education and training. The programme provides temporary opportunities for long-term unemployed persons for a period up to three years.</P>
      <P>Consultations with relevant Government Departments are currently taking place in order to progress the mainstreaming of essential services currently undertaken by participants on the CE programme. The mainstreaming of these services should enhance the services being provided and provide employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the Department of Education and Science with regard to schools services are at an advanced stage and I intend to begin the mainstreaming process and to transfer CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to that Department in time for the new school year in September next.</P>
      <P>Supervisors are employed by the sponsors of projects and these positions are funded by a grant from FÁS. The personnel concerned are not FÁS employees. My Department has discussed the issue of supervisors becoming redundant as a result of the mainstreaming of CE services with the trade union representatives and with groups of supervisors. Current arrangements allow FÁS funding for statutory redundancy payments only, in cases where it is clear that sponsors are unable to meet these costs.</P>
      <P>The matter of redundancy payments to supervisors is being considered in the overall context of the mainstreaming of CE essential services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish economy has translated strong economic growth into substantial and sustained employment growth in recent years. The rapid economic growth has resulted in the emergence of a tight labour market. This is evident from the latest figures released by the Central Statistics Office which shows an overall unemployment rate of 3.9%, with long-term unemployment at a low of 1.4% or just over 24,000 people. In addition, evidence from the recent FÁS-ESRI-Forfás survey of private sector employers indicate that 31% of employers had vacancies amounting to 77,600 or 5.8% of employment.</P>
      <P>For 2001 the Department of Finance in the stability programme, which was published on budget day in 2000, estimated that GDP will grow by 7.4% and they forecast an increase in employment of 63,000 for 2001. In addition, in the period 2001-2003 with average annual labour force growth of 2.2% they have forecast a further fall in the unemployment rate to 3.2%.</P>
      <P>These estimates predate the recent slowdown in the US economy and the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease. The full consequences of these events on the economy in terms of their precise impact on the levels and rate of unemployment can only be gauged over time following the release of key labour market indicators. Notwithstanding this, it is expected that the economy will continue to face labour and skill shortages for the foreseeable future. The economy continues to grow strongly, although at a somewhat more reduced rate than the record levels achieved in recent years. The vacancy data and the very low unemployment rate point to the fact that there remain opportunities for unemployed people to quickly find employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those persons who are unemployed there is currently a large range and scale of programmes in place to assist them in their return to work. These include the process of early identification and engagement with the unemployed at <Col N="1023" /> an early stage in unemployment with a view to offering them a job or other employability support, such as education and training to assist them in their transition to employment. These supports operate in conjunction with a wide range and scale of active labour market programmes to assist, in particular, the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups in their transition from unemployment to work.</P>

      <P>The languages chosen represent some of the larger groups coming here to work from overseas.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the most part the issues raised in this question are related to banking regulations and procedures, and as such are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance. In so far as the question relates to Irish business operations, I propose to answer the question in that context as our Department has responsibility for informing business of the requirements necessary for a smooth changeover to euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>To take the first of the issues raised in relation to Irish pound cheques, this appears to refer to the procedural arrangements that will be put in place by the Irish banking system to facilitate the changeover to the euro. The specific arrangements by financial institutions to phase out the use of Irish pound cheques and commence business with euro denominated cheques have already been agreed at industry level through the Irish Bankers Federation and will undoubtedly be the subject of a major information campaign that will be undertaken by the financial institutions to communicate directly with their customers.</P>
      <P>Irish pound denominated cheques must not be written after 31 December next and all cheques written after 31 December 2001 must be written in euro. In the interest of facilitating the early changeover to euro customers are strongly encouraged to lodge Irish pound denominated cheques with their financial institutions before 9 February 2002, that is before the end of the national dual circulation period. Euro denominated chequebooks will be available from financial institutions in advance of 1 January next and arrangements will be in place for refunding stamp duty on unused Irish pound cheques.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to see how these procedural arrangements, which have already been communicated to retailers in the guidelines produced and disseminated in significant quantities by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign could be used or acted upon in a fraudulent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to euro denominated cheques drawn on bank and building society branches, such cheques should only be used in the Republic of Ireland according to the Irish Bankers Federation. Used elsewhere they will take longer to clear and may attract significantly higher clearing charges at the beneficiary's end. This is because there is no Europe wide system for clearing cheques. Euro denominated cheques that are drawn on institutions from other participating countries will be handled in the same way as foreign currency cheques are today. Therefore, when it comes to paying foreign based suppliers or receiving payments from foreign based customers, businesses are being advised to opt for <Col N="1025" /> means of payment other than cheques. This message has already been communicated to retailers via the Forfás retail guidelines and will also be communicated by the banks directly to their business customers.</P>
    <P>A survey conducted by the ESRI in December last, on behalf of the EMU business awareness campaign, shows that at that stage 53% of retail businesses had prepared or were preparing a plan to manage the changeover in their business. The initial figures from the campaign's latest survey, for which the fieldwork has been completed and results are currently being tabulated, indicate that this figure has risen considerably with approximately 66% of retail firms indicating they have prepared, or are in the process of preparing, a euro changeover plan.</P>
    <P>With regard to the acceleration of the euro changeover campaign from a business perspective, the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign has significantly increased its activities since the start of this year. Specific activities have included: A major advertising campaign using television, radio, press and trade publications with Internet advertising to follow shortly; new guidelines to assist retailers in planning for the changeover, of which 178,000 copies have been distributed through a wide variety of channels including direct distribution by post to 40,000 retailers; presentations on the relevant EMU planning issues for business at meetings, conferences and-or seminars of professional, trade and business organisations, particularly those that represent companies in the SME sector; exhibition stands at appropriate conferences, trade and business exhibitions that facilitate dissemination of campaign messages, particularly to companies in the SME sector; articles-features in relevant publications, newsletters and journals of trade, business and professional organisations particularly those focused on companies in the SME sector; in addition, the campaign will continue with its joint information initiative with<i> Running Your Business</i>, the magazine of the Small Firms Association which is circulated to a dedicated list of 30,000 small firms; a LoCall helpline to assist business with their queries regarding changeover issues; and a national conference on the euro, which was held in Loughrea, County Galway, that highlighted the changeover experiences of the SME firms involved in the Loughrea euro town project as they switched to euro based trading. The Loughrea project, which has been run under the auspices of the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign, has identified many practical issues for SMEs in preparing for the euro.</P>
    <P>In addition to the campaign's ongoing tasks, other specific activities planned by the campaign for the remainder of the changeover period will include: A comprehensive new guide will be published shortly covering key areas of preparation including accounting, software, payroll, revenue and other issues and will be distributed to SMEs and the production of a training pack for retailers for the purpose of staff training. The latter will be distributed to every retailer here during the summer.</P>
    <P>A survey conducted by the ESRI in December, on behalf of the EMU business awareness campaign, shows that 72% of all Irish firms have received information on the changeover and have <Col N="1026" /> expressed high levels of satisfaction with the information received.</P>
    <P>Ultimately it is the responsibility of each firm to ensure that they are able to conduct their business in euro from 1 January next. The EMU business awareness campaign can only assist in providing the necessary information that will assist them to do this. We are satisfied that the necessary information has been, and continues to be, provided to Irish businesses to facilitate them with this task.</P>

      <P>In March 1999 I indicated that I was in favour of full disclosure of directors' remuneration as it would provide greater transparency in the governance of corporate affairs here. Following intensive discussions, the Stock Exchange amended its rules and, with effect from financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2000, the exchange requires publicly quoted companies to disclose directors' remuneration on an individual basis.</P>
      <P>The consequence of that rule change is becoming evident. The concerns raised by the Association of Investment Managers appear to centre on the correlation between the remuneration paid to directors and the performance of companies. This is one of the issues that potential investors assess in making decisions to invest in companies. I have no current plans to intervene in this area.</P>

      <P>The project to consolidate company law is already under way. Consolidation is set overall in the context of reviewing and reforming our company law regime to make it more efficient and more straightforward, complementing our world-class economy and sustaining our competitiveness.</P>
      <P>To progress this objective I have set up a company law review and consolidation section in my Department. This has the task of reviewing on an ongoing basis our company law regime. To assist in that review the Government is setting up a standing company law review group to bring forward on the basis of two yearly work programmes proposals for reform of company law in a structured way. The Company Law Enforcement Bill, currently on Committee Stage in the Dáil, provides for a statutory advisory role for the group. I have already set up the group on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.

      <P>The achievement of balanced regional development is a key policy and operational objective of my Department and of the industrial development agencies. It is enshrined in industrial development legislation and is a key objective in the policy statements of my Department and of the development agencies. Progress on the achievement of targets set in respect of regional development is monitored and reported on a continuous basis.</P>
      <P>Balanced regional development requires a better spread of investment, employment and population growth between regions and within regions, and not just in the urban centres. My Department and the development agencies seek to ensure that the required investments in economic and social infrastructure to achieve more balanced regional development are identified and put in place. The co-ordination of policy is continuously pursued and achieved through a number of mechanisms between my Department, Forfás and the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. The implementation of this co-ordinated policy approach is monitored annually through the approval of the negotiating guidelines of the agencies, which have a strong regional focus, by my Department and the board of Forfás.</P>
      <P>As part of its new focus on the regions, IDA Ireland, for its part, is seeking to deliver over 50% of all newly approved greenfield jobs to the Objective One region. The 50% target was met for the year 2000, ahead of the agency's schedule. Attractive financial packages will continue to be made available to appropriate projects which may choose to locate or expand in the regions.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland has developed a comprehensive approach to the achievement of balanced regional economic development. Its recently launched regional strategy document entitled Driving Growth in Regional Enterprise articulates a number of key themes which are central to the delivery of growth. The Enterprise Ireland approach is based on developing existing business, building the environment for business, encouraging new high potential start-up firms and exploiting new opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> Shannon Development, which is the regional development company for the Shannon region, will concentrate on key projects which are capable of significant economic impact for the benefit of the region. The company has also set itself the objective of achieving a more balanced spread of development throughout the Shannon region.</P>
    <P>The Government objective of achieving balanced regional economic development requires a co-ordinated partnership approach by the industrial development agencies, in consultation with my Department. I am confident that this co-ordinated approach, which involves both formal and informal contacts at all levels on a wide range of policy and operational issues, will ultimately achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>I have previously indicated my firm belief that competition provides the most effective means of keeping prices down. By promoting greater competition we can achieve greater efficiency and more choice for consumers. A valuable and very recent contribution to informing Ministers' deliberations on the <Col N="1030" /> policy options has been the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland which was launched on 24 April 2001. The report points to the fact that weak competition in key sectors poses risks to future performance; and it recommends the elimination of licensing constraints on free entry, particularly those with quantitative limits. The positive, initial response of the Government to the report, including the action programme developed by the Taoiseach in conjunction with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is a matter of public record.</P>

      <P>The Irish economy has translated strong economic growth into exceptionally large numbers of new jobs in a short period. Based on the most recent figures published by the Central Statistics Office employment has grown by 3.8% resulting in 63,000 extra persons at work in the 12 months to the fourth quarter 2000. During this period unemployment declined to its lowest level in 20 years with an unemployment rate of 3.9%. Of the 69,000 persons unemployed, based on the ILO measure, 24,000 are long-term unemployed equivalent to 1.4% of the labour force.</P>
      <P>The rapid growth in the economy and in employment has resulted in a significant tightening of the labour market. This is evident not alone from the dramatic reduction in the unemployment rate but also in increased vacancy levels and a general acceleration in wage levels. The most recent FÁS-ESRI-Forfás survey of vacancies in the private sector in early 2000 shows that there were 77,600 vacancies. This exceeds the overall numbers unemployed. One quarter of firms stated that they had difficulties in filling vacancies giving a variety of reasons including competition for labour, shortage of applicants with practical skills and a shortage of applicants with experience. As many as 15% of these firms had tried to recruit from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the current labour market situation, the Government is pursuing an integrated strategy within an overall framework of promoting employment growth and employment for all who seek it. There is a comprehensive policy mix in place to achieve these objectives. Key aspects include policies focused on mobilising indigenous labour supply from all available sources. Fiscal polices which enhance the reward for work and active labour market policies are fundamental to the achievement of positive outcomes in order to assist the unemployed and in particular the long-term unemployed in their transition to work. Further elements of this approach include the provision of education, training and, in particular, <Col N="1031" /> lifelong learning opportunities in order to strengthen the employability of individuals and to ensure that individuals have the appropriate skills consistent with the needs of firms in a rapidly growing economy.</P>
    <P>This approach of matching supply and demand is complemented by a policy aimed at facilitating balanced immigration in order to secure a consistent, strong sustainable and non inflationary level of economic growth.</P>

      <P>There has been a steady increase in the number of working visas and work authorisations issued in all three of the sectors covered by the scheme in the operational period to date. While a total of 173 were issued in June 2000 this had risen to some 436 by March 2001.</P>

      <P>Last summer I launched an action plan 2000-2001 to protect consumers as far as possible against unwarranted price rises during the changeover to the euro which is being implemented by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Needless to say, the secretariat of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland was consulted when the action plan was being prepared.</P>
      <P>A key action under the plan relates to the dual display of prices: A special logo to be associated with adherence to either the national code or approved sectoral codes of practice on dual pricing, will be available from the Director of Consumer Affairs; display of the logo means that the businesses concerned are publicly committed to carrying out the changeover fairly without seeking any advantage from the conversion; consumers should be able to feel confident that they will not be overcharged for goods or services where they see the logo on display; and the Director of Consumer Affairs has written to more than 200 trade associations inviting them to sign up to the national code or to draw up a sectoral code of their own and seek the director's approval for it. In addition, the director's office is in the process of responding to close on 100 applications from potential individual subscribers to the national code. To date, the director has approved three sectoral codes, submitted to her by IBEC-EAN, the Irish Petroleum Industry Association, and the Irish branch of the Booksellers Association of Great Britain and Ireland. A further three proposed sectoral codes are currently under active examination by the director.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that consumers can contact the Director of Consumer Affairs with queries or complaints they may have on the euro at www.odcaeuroinfo@entemp.ie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going beyond commitments developed at <Col N="1033" /> national level, under the action plan the idea of a voluntary commitment to overall price stability appears in the joint statement adopted on 2 April 2001 by representatives of the retail trades, SMEs and consumers in the eurozone: </P>
    <P>Retailers undertake not to use the changeover to the euro to apply hidden price rises. They undertake to do their utmost to ensure the overall stability of their prices when converting them into euros and to publicise these commitments using appropriate communication tools. In order to reflect this commitment and to get the message across to consumers, they will use the European slogan &ldquo;new currency, stable prices&rdquo; as much as possible in all appropriate contexts.</P>
    <P>The full text of the joint statement is included at annex 3 to the report on the preparations in the eurozone for the introduction of euro notes and coins which is attached to the Commission Communication of 3 April 2001 and which can be accessed at: www.europa.eu.int/comm/economy finance/document/euro/com2001190/comm2001 190en.htm</P>

      <P>Term time working is one of a number of family friendly working arrangements which allow parents to reconcile their family and work responsibilities. In order to support and facilitate family friendly policies in the workplace, the National Framework Committee for the Development of Family Friendly Policies at the Level of the Enterprise was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The committee comprises representatives of ICTU, IBEC, public sector employers, the Equality Authority, a number of Departments and is chaired by my Department.</P>
      <P>The national framework committee has already undertaken a number of initiatives to raise awareness and provide information on family friendly working arrangements, including term time working. The first family friendly workplace day was held on 1 March and the interactive website www.familyfriendly.ie was launched. An information brochure entitled An Introduction to Family Friendly Working Arrangements was produced on behalf of the national framework committee and is available from the Equality Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government as an employer is committed to family friendly working arrangements. The <Col N="1034" /> Government views the introduction of the term time scheme throughout the civil service as an important addition to the range of family friendly working arrangements currently available in the Civil Service. Term time leave will be available throughout the Civil Service from 2001 onwards, having previously been available on a pilot basis in a limited number of Departments and offices. The operation of the scheme is subject to the operating requirements of Departments not being adversely affected.</P>
    <P>As stated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the development of appropriate measures to assist in reconciling work and family life is important to underpinning economic, social and equality objectives. The challenge is to establish family friendly policies that reflect the reality of the workplace and meet the many diverse needs of employees. A partnership approach in the workplace is the best way in which this issue should be addressed in order to achieve tailor made solutions to the benefit of the workforce and the employer.</P>
    <P>I believe the work of the national framework committee, allied to a partnership approach in the workplace between employers, employees and trade unions, and appropriate legislative measures, such as carer's leave, can achieve the goal of making workplaces family friendly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, through its enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encourage the establishment of industry in the regions. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. The BMW region is a priority location for IDA Ireland for the attraction of suitable inward investment projects and the further entrenchment of existing projects.</P>
      <P>Over the past 18 months IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies with the aim of delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into Objective One regions in the coming years. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to ensure that the objective will be achieved IDA Ireland initially reorganised its internal structures. This restructuring included an allocation of additional staff to its regional offices, opening new regional offices in Cavan <Col N="1035" /> and Limerick and the allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its HQ project divisions.</P>
    <P>Recently IDA Ireland announced that further additional posts would be transferred to Athlone bringing the staff complement there up to 30 and to Sligo bringing the staff complement in that location up to 15. The purpose of these moves is to drive growth from within the regions and to develop these centres as magnets for growth for these regions.</P>
    <P>Other IDA Ireland initiatives for promoting the BMW region include putting a greater focus on marketing of specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the region.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland's incentive package is also strongly geared in favour of the Objective One region which is in line with the EU State aid code. The new State aid rules were introduced at the beginning of 2000 and will run until 2006. They divide the country into two distinct regions with different limits regarding the level and types of incentives that can be provided.</P>
    <P>The Objective One region is allowed grant rates up to a maximum of 40% during the 2000-2006 period plus a 10% top-up for SMEs. These differentiated rates make the BMW region more attractive for potential investors.</P>
    <P>In the Objective One region IDA Ireland has also acquired a number of additional sites and upgraded many of its sites to business park standard. Furthermore, the agency, in partnership with private developers, has arranged to provide advance factories and advance offices in a number of key locations throughout the region.</P>
    <P>Improved access is crucial to attracting new overseas investment to the regions. This has been recognised in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which includes plans to improve our roads, railways and air services. Availability of high quality telecommunications and energy supplies are also essential. Expenditure under this heading in the national development plan is significantly biased on a <i>per capita</i> basis in favour of the Objective One region and should help to close the infrastructure deficit which exists in most of this region. IDA Ireland and the other development agencies will keep in close contact with relevant infrastructure providers to ensure that they are aware of the needs of enterprises.</P>
    <P>As a result of the above initiatives 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during 2000 in new greenfield investment projects have been secured for the Objective One region. During the year 2000 there was also an increase of 2,155 in the total numbers employed in IDA Ireland assisted companies in the BMW region to 29,520. These are strong results and came from intensive and radically changed marketing approaches by the IDA Ireland team working in close partnership with the local authorities and the third level colleges and universities across the region.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has also been active in the BMW region. On 5 February 2001 Enterprise <Col N="1036" /> Ireland launched a new regional development strategy. This strategy highlights the strengths of the BMW region, in particular the availability of skilled labour at a time of national skill shortages and the expertise available in, and from, the institutes of technology in the region. These are particularly attractive both to new start-up companies and to expansion minded east coast companies which are experiencing staff shortages at their existing locations. Enterprise Ireland will continue to endeavour to ensure that indigenous industry in the BMW region reaps the benefits of these strengths and expands and grows in a considered and sustainable manner.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forfás have set up a system to ensure a co-ordinated approach to regional development which is being driven by a senior manager from each agency. This will result in the identification of a series of specific actions to be taken to help drive the development of each of the regions set within a succinct, contextual, descriptive framework of each region covering past and expected future trends, strengths and weaknesses. The objective will be to push the actions identified on a combined cross agency basis.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that the county enterprise boards, which fall under the remit of my Department, are also active in the BMW region and are continuing to contribute positively to the growth of micro industry in the region.</P>

      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety. It sets out the responsibilities of both employers and employees in relation to providing a safe working environment. The Act applies to all places of work and to all employers, employees and the self-employed.</P>
      <P>The 1989 Act is supplemented by a series of regulations. One set of regulations is the European Community (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Noise) Regulations, 1990. These regulations, which apply to all workers, lay down certain standards and requirements which should be met in order to minimise hearing damage caused by loud noise.</P>
      <P>The monitoring and inspection of workplaces is a day-to-day matter for the authority in which I have no direct function. I have been informed by the authority that in 2000 they undertook a specific inspection and awareness raising programme, amongst employers and employees in the entertainment sector, to highlight the risks posed by high noise levels and to ensure that noise exposure levels are measured and recorded as required by the noise regulations. Almost 100 inspections were undertaken, as a result of which a number of advice letters and improvement notices were issued.</P>
      <P>This inspection and awareness programme will continue this year and a target of 100 visits to places of entertainment has been set. It is also intended to arrange discussions with industry representatives with the objective of increasing levels of awareness of their obligations to their staff under the noise regulations and to promote compliance with the levels of noise exposure set down in them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, through the promotional agencies and Enterprise Ireland in particular, assists individual companies to develop their exports in all markets where there is potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also seeks to assess export markets continuously to identify weaknesses and opportunities. While Enterprise Ireland maintains high levels of activity in many countries, <Col N="1038" /> much of the current focus in developing markets with significant potential for export growth is on Asia and the EU.</P>
    <P>The Government's Asia strategy, which was put in place in 1999, was designed to increase the awareness of Ireland as a source of supply in Asia, on the one hand, and to increase the exposure of Irish companies to the high potential markets in the region, on the other. China and Japan were identified as the key markets but there has also been activity in other Asian markets such as India, Korea and Taiwan.</P>
    <P>Last year exports to Japan totalled £2.47 billion compared with £1.54 billion in 1999. Imports in 2000 totalled £2.08 billion. This was the first year in which Ireland had a trade surplus with Japan. We expect exports to grow further this year. In support of that goal the Tánaiste led a trade mission to Japan in March which included 64 companies. During the mission contracts worth $26 million were signed and nine further agency, distribution and partnership agreements were concluded.</P>
    <P>Last year our exports to China also increased substantially to £131 million from £93.7 million in 1999. Imports from China totalled £706 million. Since last year we have seen a substantial increase in activity between Ireland and China, including the trade mission of 51 companies in September. There have also been eight visits by groups of Chinese companies to Ireland since September last year and as a result we expect exports to continue to increase.</P>
    <P>In Europe, Enterprise Ireland launched a major strategy last year to encourage more companies to develop their sales to our partners in the EU. Measures taken in support of this goal include the provision of language and marketing training for companies and the establishment of new incubator units in seven key cities &ndash; Paris, Dusseldorf, Munich, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and Vienna &ndash; to assist Irish companies to establish themselves in the markets.</P>
    <P>Last year our exports to the EU other than the UK amounted to over £26 billion, up from £22.7 billion in 1999. Imports in 2000 amounted to slightly over £10 billion.</P>
    <P>The United States continues to represent a market with significant potential for Irish companies in spite of the current economic uncertainty there. Last year exports to the USA increased to £11.2 billion from £8.1 billion in 1999. Imports increased to £7.2 billion.</P>
    <P>Other markets which present valuable opportunities and which have been relatively under developed by Irish companies include Russia, Mexico and the countries seeking to join the European Union.</P>

      <P>The Donegal employment task force report which was presented to me in July 1999, recommended that 9,950 new jobs be created-approved by 2006 to compensate for job losses and redundancies and to reduce unemployment to the national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> A significant programme of job promotion, itineraries and co-ordinated action on the ground led to the approval-creation of over 2,000 jobs in the 1999/2000 period of which about 1,750 were jobs assisted by IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Údaras na Gaeltachta. In addition, work is ongoing in developing business and office parks and advance space and facilities. Considerable progress has also been achieved in creating higher technology-higher value added jobs in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Despite this progress I am aware that difficulties remain in achieving net job gains due to the high level of job losses in the county. To address this position I recently asked Forfás to consider options in relation to improving the level and quality of research and development activity in the northwest, including possible links through science foundation funding or other similar programmes. IDA is also playing its part in the development of Donegal by maintaining the maximum number of existing jobs in overseas industry and by attracting new investment in manufacturing and international services. Enterprise Ireland, whose priority is attracting companies to Donegal from Dublin and the east coast, will run a marketing day in Dublin in June 2001 to highlight to expanding companies the benefits of locating in the regions.</P>

      <P>Under current support arrangements, employees who are laid off may qualify for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit subject to the conditions for receipt of UA-UB being satisfied. Persons who lose their jobs and subsequently register with FÁS can avail of an extensive range and scale of supports including FÁS matching services where persons are referred to employers in the case of notified job vacancies. This service is augmented, where appropriate, with guidance and counselling interviews to assist persons in their move to a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where closures arise both the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and agencies under the aegis of my Department, such as FÁS, are proactive in providing a response tailored to the particular circumstances of the closure. In the case of large scale closures, for example, FÁS has contacted senior personnel in the human resources department of firms where immediate offers of assistance have been made to support employees who will be made redundant. <Col N="1042" /> The type of supports on offer includes registration, assistance in sourcing alternative employment, retraining and career guidance. FÁS also play an invaluable role as part of a task force team established to deal with large scale closures. These teams are normally comprised of representatives from State agencies, trade union officials, chambers of commerce and local authorities. When and where appropriate, the FÁS co-operative development unit would also supply advice and assistance in cases of job losses-closures.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that adequate supports are in place to provide for those who have lost their jobs through recent closures. In our current economic climate with substantial numbers of vacancies in the economy and a low unemployment rate there remains opportunities for unemployed people to quickly find new employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>While I am concerned at any factors that might adversely affect industrial employment, there is no evidence available to my Department or the industrial development agencies of any increased tendency for firms to relocate to low wage economies.</P>
      <P>The experience of the agencies is that the reasons for relocation are many, varied and complex. Ireland has on balance benefited from such movement in recent times due to the strength of our economy, and the trend in employment arising from inward investment continues to be extremely favourable. A record 23,300 new jobs were created in IDA Ireland supported companies during 2000. Allowing for job losses of 8,100, total employment in IDA companies increased by 15,200 to almost 140,000 and this represents an increase of 12.2%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> Those job losses which are occurring are mainly as a result of the restructuring process which is going on in industry in Ireland whereby activities, and hence jobs, at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context. The agencies, in working with their client companies, make every effort to assist them in addressing any constraints which impact on their investing within the Irish economy. In the event of a client considering relocation of all or part of its Irish operation, the agency concerned would pursue the recovery of grants and grant aided assets as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The IDA's policy is to focus a major part of its efforts on an embedding programme for the existing overseas owned companies in this country. It also seeks to ensure that, as jobs are lost at the lower end of the scale, they are more than compensated for by a greater number of jobs at the higher end. This process has achieved considerable success over the past decade and would not have occurred without the IDA's continual active promotion of Ireland as an investment location against competition from other destinations for foreign investment.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to quantify the results of trade missions in monetary terms.

      <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directives in 1994, entitled European Communities (Life Assurance and Non-Life Insurance) Framework Regulations, 1994, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries and has increased choice of product to the benefit of the Irish consumer. Currently, there are 27 insurers authorised to underwrite motor insurance in Ireland and a similar number are authorised to underwrite public liability insurance cover. As many as 15 companies have their headquarters in Ireland, 11 are based in other EU member states and one is a non-EU insurer. In addition, the removal of the cap on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>There has been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of premiums, focusing on a number of the key cost elements. These include the costs associated with settling personal injury compensation claims and the factors contributing to the cost of premiums for compulsory motor insurance.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a personal injuries assessment board by 2002 is being pursued by an implementation group. In addition, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board will be reporting later this year and I will take whatever further action is appropriate towards the goal of the reduction of the cost of motor insurance.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, the pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to either.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>A key focus of this Government's policy has been to strengthen Irish industry's overall economic competitiveness through a range of actions. At the macro level we are continuing to cut the burden of taxation and regulation on enterprise, thus ensuring that the enterprise sector remains competitive and soundly based for the future.</P>
      <P>A major feature of the activity of our enterprise agencies has been to reorientate industry towards higher value added sectors and restructuring in the indigenous and foreign owned industrial base. This has led to a shift in employment into higher productivity sectors, thereby maintaining competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The most recent CSO trade release figures show that Ireland's merchandise trade performance continues to be outstanding. Exports last year totalled over £65 billion &ndash; 83 billion &ndash; the highest level ever recorded. The trade surplus exceeded all previous records and grew by 23% to stand at £22 billion &ndash; 28 billion &ndash; for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> The value of Irish exports increased by 24% in 2000. Our export growth remains well above the global and EU averages. This reflects an exceptional trade performance by Ireland's very competitive exporting sector, which is going from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>Provisional trade statistics for exports for the first two months of 2001 for non-EU countries totalled nearly £4.5 billion, a further increase, of 48%, over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>The continuing growth of our exporting sector is the key pillar around which Ireland's exceptional economic growth is centred. Irish exporters are clearly competing successfully at world-class level and the trade figures indicate that the exporting sector will continue to be competitive and support the continuation of Ireland's success as a dynamic economy and trading nation for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current licensing terms were very carefully designed and introduced in 1992 to compensate for Ireland's disadvantage in terms of perceived prospectivity and operating conditions and to encourage interest in exploration and development.</P>
      <P>Only two exploration wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore in the last three years, despite the existence of the 1992 terms and there are 20 offshore exploration licences in place at present compared to a peak of 32 in 1997. Furthermore, a number of exploration companies granted licences under a licensing round in 1997 have indicated their intention to relinquish these licences this year.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that Irish prospectivity is low and is not comparable with our oil producing neighbours. We have only had three successful exploration wells out of 123 wells in 30 years. Over the same period the United Kingdom has drilled about 3,000 wells of which about 250 are in production.</P>
      <P>In the light of these factors, I believe that it is premature to consider changing our terms but I intend to keep them under continuing review taking account of the level of, and results from, ongoing exploration activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of exploration well 5/22-1, the operator, Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited, EEIL, submitted an application for approval to drill to my Department's petroleum affairs division, PAD, the regulatory body for petroleum exploration and production operations onshore and offshore. When PAD was satisfied with the drilling programme proposed and all other State requirements had been met relating to safety, emergency preparedness, pollution control and preparedness, navigation warnings etc., approval was given for drilling the well.</P>
      <P>During the course of the drilling operations, the technical section &ndash; professional petroleum specialists &ndash; in PAD received and analysed daily drilling and geological reports and copies of all data acquired during the operations. EEIL sought approval to plug and abandon the well which was given once my Department was satisfied to do so. In following this process, this well was treated like every other Irish exploration well.</P>
      <P>Regulatory approval for any well is dependent on an exploration programme satisfactory to my Department, with specific agreement required on the well objectives, well location, target depth and evaluation programme, which always involves the running of suites of wireline logs by one contractor or another.</P>
      <P>Approval to plug and abandon a well given by my Department is based on the technical evaluation by PAD of the data acquired during the drilling operations, and is given only when they are satisfied that the agreed objectives have been achieved and the agreed evaluation programme has been carried out.</P>
      <P>As regards the well 5/22-1 data, I am obliged, under the licensing terms, to keep specific information about offshore operations confidential for prescribed periods of time. Data requested by the Deputy, which I have already released about the 5/22-1 well, and which I make available for all wells, is as follows: </P>
      <P>EEIL fulfilled an agreed total depth obligation, required as a condition of approval of the drilling operation by PAD:</P>

    <P>A full suite of wireline logs were obtained by a commercial contractor, name irrelevant, in accordance with the evaluation programme agreed between the operator and PAD. Wireline <Col N="1048" /> logs are an intrinsic element in the evaluation of all wells.</P>
    <P>The casing programme was carried out as planned. Casing has no direct relevance to evaluation of a well; it is run in all wells as a standard part of their construction to ensure that the hole does not collapse.

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the PRSI ceiling should remain at £28,250 in 2001 being a shorter tax year; and if, in view of an apparent inequality, he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the PRSI employee ceiling should remain at £28,250 for the nine months tax year, from 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001. As I have said in previous replies on this topic, the &ldquo;PRSI Holiday&rdquo; issue is of relevance only to the minority of employees, an estimated 13%, who have annual earnings above the contribution ceiling. When annual earnings are in excess of the relevant contribution ceiling, employees have a <Col N="1052" /> period in each contribution year in which no contribution is due; the duration of this period depends on the level of annual earnings and the point in the tax year at which the earnings ceiling is reached. Up to this, &ldquo;PRSI Holidays&rdquo; tended to be concentrated mainly in the first quarter of the calendar year in the lead up to the end of the tax year on 5 April.</P>
      <P>Prior to the decision to align the tax and calendar years from January 2002, relevant employees could have expected a contribution holiday mainly in the first quarter of 2002. Arising from this alignment, their contribution holiday will be deferred until the final quarter of 2002. Leaving the contribution ceiling intact for the short calendar year does not impose any additional PRSI liability on the employees involved, as they will continue to have two PRSI holidays over the two year period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002, as they would have had prior to the changeover, although the second holiday period will now mainly be in the final quarter of 2002. Of course, for those employees whose earnings exceed £28,250 in the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001, no PRSI contributions will be payable from the point in the period the earnings ceiling is reached until 31 December 2001.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I do not accept that leaving the PRSI employee ceiling at £28,250 for the short tax year represents an inequality. As stated above, reducing the employee ceiling for the short tax year would benefit only the small percentage of employees with earnings in excess of the ceiling, while those with incomes below the ceiling would not be any better off as a result as they would continue to have a PRSI liability throughout the full nine months period.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would remind the Deputy that most employees are now benefiting from the reduction of 0.5% to 4% in the contribution rate of PRSI, effective from 6 April 2001, which was announced in budget 2001.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the administration of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, that they have not received an application for relief from the person who is the subject of this question. It is a fundamental requirement for relief under the scheme that the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of the <Col N="1053" /> required certificate is refused, this may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal which is an independent body whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>In this case I understand that the senior area medical officer refused to issue a primary medical certificate to the person concerned. This refusal was appealed to the medical board of appeal on 18 April, 2001 and an appointment for assessment by the board will be made for the person in due course.</P>
      <P>It is regretted that the Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application under the scheme without the issue of a primary medical certificate.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the scheme is currently under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme including the medical criteria.</P>

      <Quest>the threshold for capital acquisitions tax between siblings not living together; the reason the £10,000 threshold as set in 1976 has not been inflation linked; the current level of the threshold; the level it would be if inflation indexed since 1976; if he will adjust the threshold to the index linked level in the next budget; and the reason farmers only pay a fraction of capital acquisition tax due whereas others with assets in private houses pay the full rate.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital acquisitions tax, CAT, exempt threshold now applying on transfers between siblings is £31,680. When CAT was first introduced in 1976, this threshold was £10,000. If this figure had been indexed linked to the consumer price index since 1976, the amount which would now apply is approximately £53,000. The three exemption thresholds applying for gifts and inheritances have been indexed annually to the consumer price index since 1990. In addition, I increased these three threshold amounts in the budget 2000, including the threshold for transfers between siblings from £25,720 to £30,000.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I also introduced other substantial changes to the CAT legislation in budget 2000. In addition to increasing the three tax free thresholds for gifts and inheritances, I introduced a single CAT rate of 20% to replace the previous rates of 20%, 30% and 40%. I also introduced a dwelling house exemption whereby the transfer of a shared family home is exempt from CAT, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures will reduce the CAT liability of all beneficiaries, including siblings. The significant package of measures contained in budget 2000 constitutes the biggest single easement in the structure of CAT since its introduction in 1976. When considering the increase in the three <Col N="1054" /> exempt thresholds in budget 2000, I decided against further increases because of Exchequer costs. However, the issue of CAT will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Farmers can avail of an agricultural relief under the CAT legislation. This relief allows the value of gifts or inheritances received to be reduced by 90% for CAT purposes, subject to certain qualifying conditions. Agricultural relief applies only where the beneficiary's assets are 80% or more made up of agricultural assets after the gift or inheritance. Qualifying agricultural assets include land, buildings, livestock and machinery. There is also a CAT business relief available which also allows a 90% CAT reduction for qualifying business assets subject to certain conditions. The rationale for both of these reliefs is to enable family-owned businesses or farms to transfer to the next generation and in the case of the farmers to take account of the fact that the current market value of agricultural land is frequently much higher than is justified by its earning potential.</P>
    <P>In relation to individuals who inherit a private house other than the house they have been living in, the normal market value rules apply, as is the case with most assets.</P>

      <P>However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue obtains details annually of taxi and hackney plates issued by local authorities.

Taxi and hackney plate holders are targeted in the same way as other non-filers for appropriate action by Revenue to ensure that the returns are made and, where appropriate, are subject to <Col N="1055" /> audit and investigation programmes to ensure compliance with tax obligations .</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran Report &ndash; Review of Orthodontic Services &ndash; structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. These structural changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> As part of this initiative, my Department approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a grant in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of tax credits on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders. The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, has informed me that the working group established to report on the implementation of the grant-in-aid scheme in the Northern Area Health Board, NAHB, is currently continuing its work to finalise the scheme and is examining the Deputy's point regarding the delay in assessing patients.</P>
    <P>The target date for the implementation of the scheme is late May to early June.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are among the conditions prescribed under the Act. Drugs which are directly related to the treatment of these conditions are made available free of charge. The operation of the scheme known as the long-term illness scheme, LTI, is primarily a matter for the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>Persons who have been diagnosed with any of the illnesses prescribed under the Act, including diabetes, should apply to their local health board for admission to the scheme. Once eligible, they are issued with a long-term illness book which lists the drugs and medicines which will be provided to them free of charge through their community pharmacist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any difficulties at present in relation to the operation of this scheme. However, if the Deputy could forward details to me of specific instances where individuals have encountered difficulty in obtaining their <Col N="1060" /> medication under the scheme, I will have further inquiries made in the matter.</P>

    <P>My Department does not receive information from the authority on the number awaiting a bed at 8 a.m. each day. However, I have asked the regional chief executive of the authority to have the information compiled and forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The need for patient treatment is, in the first instance, determined by medical assessment by the clinician initiating the hospital referral, usually the patient's general practitioner. The general practitioner determines the point of referral for the patient based on his or her knowledge of availability of service, regionally or in Dublin, which will best meet his or her patient's medical need.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that Dublin hospitals should continue to provide non-national speciality procedures to some patients living outside the eastern region until such time as this Government's current policy of addressing geographic imbalances in acute hospital service provision is complete. Evidence of the implementation of this policy can be found in the major capital developments being funded under the national development plan at Limerick, Galway, Castlebar, Naas, Clonmel and Portiuncula hospitals, to mention but some.</P>
    <P>Equity of access geographically is one of the key principles underpinning health policy and the Government is committed to ensuring that patients have access to services in close proximity to their homes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute settings, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The bed review, which is at a advanced stage, is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> The review involves the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and is specifically examining the need for acute beds on a national basis. The review will be completed shortly and the findings will be brought to Government.</P>

      <P>In late 1999, the Government gave a commitment to meet the identified needs of persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism within a defined timeframe of three years, commencing with a major acceleration of investment &ndash; both revenue and capital &ndash; in 2000. Additional revenue funding amounting to £28 million, with a full year cost in 2001 of £35 million, was made available in 2000 for new service developments. Some £10.7 million was also made available in 2000 to meet the full year cost of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services. In 2001, a further £28 million, with a full year cost in 2002 of £35 million, was made available for the development of new services, together with a further £10 million to meet the full year cost of the 2000 developments and identified needs in existing services. In all, therefore, the overall total revenue investment in the services over the last two years is £76.7 million, increasing to £83.7 million in 2002. Capital funding amounting to £75 million, £30 million in 2000 and £45 million in 2001 has also been allocated to provide the necessary infrastructure to support the service developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Additional funding amounting to £13.17 million in 2000 and £13.165 million in 2001, with a full year cost of £14.71 million in 2002, has been allocated to date to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the development of new services, together with a further £4.28 million over the two year period in question to meet identified needs in existing services. Capital funding amounting to £26.9 million has also been allocated to the authority for the services in the same period.</P>
    <P>When allocating additional funding for new services, estimates are made, based on averaged costs, of the number of new residential, respite and day places which might be expected from this funding. However these figures are subsequently adjusted to take account of the actual number of new places which are provided by the end of the year in question. As the Deputy will appreciate, the cost of providing residential, respite and day places varies, depending on individual client needs. In 2000, 422 new residential, 166 new respite and 815 new day places were provided. The original estimated figures for the services were 555 residential, 185 respite and 700 day places. In addition to the new residential places, there was also a significant level of enhanced service provision for persons who were already in receipt of some level of residential care. This would include for example extending a five day placement to seven days. In the case of respite care, some day respite services were also provided, in addition to an enhanced level of home support. Other health related support services were also enhanced and progress was also made in relation to the transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements and in developing specialist services for those who require a more intensive level of support. My Department is currently receiving details of the expected number of new residential, respite and day places for 2001 from the health boards and I will let the Deputy have this information when it is compiled.</P>
    <P>Despite encountering similar difficulties to other areas of the health services in recruiting and retaining certain categories of staff, the funding for these services has been fully taken up by the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the various other service providers.</P>
    <P>My Department is reviewing the position in relation to this development programme on an ongoing basis with the health boards. Initial information from the national intellectual disability database in relation to the level of service provision and identified need as of 30 May 2001, which will reflect the impact of the 2000 development programme, will also be available in the early autumn and will assist my Department in this matter. The national monitoring committee, which is representative of my Department, the Health Research Board, the chief executives of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Mental <Col N="1065" /> Handicap, the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland (NAMHI) and the National Parents and Siblings Alliance, are also involved in the monitoring of this programme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage give specific commitments in relation to levels of expenditure in 2002 for any particular service area as these matters will be decided as part of the discussions on the Estimates and budget for that year between my Department and the Department of Finance. I would however like to assure the Deputy that this Government will fulfil the commitment which it gave in relation to meeting the needs of this population group when it initiated the current investment programme.</P>

      <P>The description of the N2 is set out in the Roads Act, 1993 (Declaration of National Roads) Order, 1994 (S.I. No. 209 of 1994): the route extends from Dublin to the Border at Moy Bridge, County Monaghan.</P>

    <P>It is assumed that the question refers to the methodology of the National Road Needs Study, NRA, 1998, in estimating future traffic volumes on national routes and assessing appropriate road types for the purposes of the national road improvement programme. Detailed information on this matter may appropriately be sought from the National Roads Authority. In summary, however, the assessments of the national road needs study relate in all cases to sections of national road routes rather than to the overall route and are also confined to road lengths comprehended within the formal descriptions of the national road network as set out in orders under the Roads Act, 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is making good progress on the preparation of the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>Following an initial round of public consultation last year my Department completed and published a report on the scope of the strategy, setting out the issues and challenges it needed to address and a work programme to ensure its delivery by the end of this year. This was followed by a period of extensive research during which a wide range of issues such as population and labour force projections, the future role of Dublin in Ireland and Europe, urban and rural functioning, factors driving the location of enterprise, quality of life issues, infrastructure and environmental protection were analysed and assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the information which has been collected, my Department is preparing a series of indicative policy papers setting out the possible choices and opportunities for promoting new patterns of development throughout Ireland over the next 20 years to support the achievement of more balanced regional development through developing the potential of the country as a whole, and of different areas within the country, <Col N="1068" /> including Donegal. The issues which these policy papers will address include the question of improving the spatial linkages, connections and co-operative arrangements with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The policy papers will be published as soon as possible. Their publication will be followed by an intense period of consultation with regional and local interests, the social partners, sustainable development partners and other representative groups. Following that, and taking account of the responses and views received during the consultation phase, the proposals for inclusion in the strategy itself will be further developed, with a view to having the strategy submitted to the Government for approval in late autumn and published by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Contract meter readers engaged by the ESB are considered to be self-employed persons for social insurance purposes. Successive decisions by deciding officers of my Department and, where appropriate, by appeals officers of the social welfare appeals office have confirmed this position. Accordingly, contract meter readers pay PRSI as self-employed persons, that is PRSI class S.</P>
      <P>The ESB Meter Readers Association has sought a further review of the employment status and PRSI position of contract meter readers. They were invited to submit a number of test cases to the scope section in the Department for formal decisions on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six test cases were submitted to the Department and a deciding officer, having considered the available evidence, concluded that the persons concerned are self-employed for social <Col N="1069" /> insurance purposes and that PRSI class 9 is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The persons concerned have appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. Having made a preliminary examination of these cases an appeals officer has concluded that an oral appeal hearing is necessary. This will be arranged as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his-her dependants.</P>
      <P>The present basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement payable in any individual case was put in place in 1996. The various types of prescribed diets are grouped into two categories, one comprising lower cost diets and the other comprising higher cost diets.</P>
      <P>Diet supplements are paid subject to a means test and applicants are required to contribute any excess assessable means towards their food costs.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of calculating the rate of diet supplement payable, the lower cost diets were deemed to cost £27 per week and the higher cost diets were deemed to cost £35 per week. In the case of single people, the amount payable was calculated on the basis that one-third of their income is spent on food.</P>
      <P>Where the applicant is one of a couple, the amount payable was calculated on the basis that one-sixth of the couple's joint income is spent on the diet supplement applicant's food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a lower cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is £27 less one-third of the applicant's income, one-sixth in the case of a couple. In the case of a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is £35 less <Col N="1070" /> one-third of the applicant's income, one-sixth in the case of a couple. Increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1996 are disregarded for the purposes of this means test as they would have the effect of reducing the rate of diet supplement payable in all cases and would eliminate entitlement altogether in many cases.</P>
    <P>In the case of children under the age of 18 there is a standard rate of £8 per week for a higher cost diet and £5 per week for a lower cost diet. In the case of persons with dependent children the child dependants' allowance is not assessed.</P>
    <P>The SWA scheme is being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations and a fundamental examination of the diet supplement will be undertaken in this context.</P>

The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>The South-Western Area Health Board was contacted and has advised that it has no record of an application for rent supplement from the person concerned. If he wishes to make an application for rent supplement he should contact the community welfare officer at his local health centre.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000, currently before the Oireachtas, provides for the implementation of the provisions of the European Community directive on part-time workers. That directive provides that part-time workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers in relation to the terms and conditions of employment, including pensions. The Bill's provisions do not, however, impact directly on the unemployment benefit scheme because, under EU rules social security cover is a matter for determination by individual member states. The conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit require, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person must be available for full-time employment. This does not preclude a person from accepting an offer of part-time work where there is no suitable full-time work available. In such circumstances, unemployment benefit may continue to be paid for days of unemployment, provided the person continues to be available for full-time work.</P>
      <P>The rules governing entitlement to unemployment payments are kept under review to see whether changes are required to meet the needs of a changing labour market situation. Any change on the lines set out would have major implications for the schemes involved and there are no plans at present to introduce a change on these lines.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to <Col N="1073" /> the reply to Question No. 486 of 1 May 2001. As mentioned in that reply, during the course of the debate on the Broadcasting Bill, I undertook in the Dáil and the Seanad to make known to the Independent Radio and Television Commission the strength of feeling and the sense of urgency expressed in relation to this matter. I wrote to the Independent Radio and Television Commission outlining the strong views of the Oireachtas and I received a response on 11 April. I have arranged to have a copy of the response from the Independent Radio and Television Commission forwarded to the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this portrait was brought back from the Seanad to the National Gallery in 1999 when building and redecoration works commenced in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Following an examination of the condition of the painting by the National Gallery I was advised that experts there have determined that there has been a noticeable deterioration in it. A report on the condition of the portrait has been submitted to the board of the National Gallery and I am advised that it has been concluded that the painting is even more fragile than was first thought. The board of the National Gallery, conscious of the significance of the painting to the Oireachtas and the conservation work that is needed to be carried out to the work, have recommended that consideration be given to commissioning a replica of the highest standards for hanging here. Representations have also recently been made to me by a member of the Oireachtas who is favourably disposed to having a transparency reproduction of the painting on quality canvas commissioned and who recognises the fragile condition of the original.</P>
      <P>While this suggestion appears to have some merit, before I consider it further I will seek the views of other Oireachtas members.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the issues highlighted by the Deputy were raised at a residents' meeting on 24 April 2001, which was also attended by members of the Garda Síochána and Dublin Corporation. Such inter-agency co-operation, in partnership with the local community, is considered essential to successfully tackling these issues, and much progress has already been made in this regard.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of the criminal justice system, a garda sergeant and three members of Garda rank are assigned to the area in question, and they take positive action against persons committing public order offences and other activities which are affecting the quality of life of residents. In particular, I am advised that, in the past three months, four searches under the Misuse of Drugs Act were carried out by community gardaí.</P>
      <P>While law enforcement responses targeting specific problems will continue, other positive efforts are being pursued. For example, since 1998, my Department has been funding the MOST Garda youth diversion project in O'Devaney Gardens and Montpellier, which seeks to divert local young persons from becoming involved in criminal and/or anti-social behaviour. Other initiatives, such as the Garda schools programme in St. Gabriel's School, the availability of the Garda community bus for outings, the exchange of information with Dublin Corporation and the assignment of two members of Garda rank to the local summer project for its duration, are promoting positive outcomes.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the area in question is being kept under review by the Garda Síochána and that it will continue to receive Garda attention.</P>

      <P>Government action in meeting its obligations under the Beijing platform for action, in so far as it relates to the 12 suggestions made by the Interparliamentary Union, is set out here under the headings given by the Interparliamentary Union.</P>
      <P>Informing parliament and parliamentary mechanisms for follow-up to the Beijing Process, suggestions one, five and six.</P>
      <P>A wide-ranging debate took place in this House at the end of 1995 on the Beijing platform for action.</P>
      <P>Members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights formed part of the official delegation of Ireland to the United Nations general assembly special session &ldquo;Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century&rdquo;, Beijing plus five.</P>
      <P>The Interparliamentary Union's 12 suggestions for parliamentary follow up to Beijing plus five was distributed at a meeting organised by the Interparliamentary Union in conjunction with the UN division for the advancement of women in New York at this event.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights is charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with considering and reporting on &ldquo;such matters relating to women's rights generally as it may decide and, in this regard, the joint committee is free to consider areas relating to any Government Department.&rdquo; The joint committee established a sub-committee on Women's Rights to facilitate such consideration in July 1998.</P>
      <P>Setting up of a non-discriminatory and gender-sensitive legislative framework, suggestion two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major pieces of rights-based legislation have been introduced in the last five years. These <Col N="1079" /> include the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, outlaws discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds &ndash; gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. This Act repeals and replaces the Employment Equality Act, 1977 and the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974. The Act, for example, allows an employer to put in place positive action measures to promote equal opportunities, particularly those geared to removing existing inequalities which affect women's opportunities in access to employment, vocational training and promotion. This is a significant development on the 1977 Act, which confined positive action measures to training.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Act, 2000, gives protection against discrimination in non-workplace areas and thus complements the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The Act prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the same nine grounds as the Employment Equality Act, 1998. It deals with discrimination outside the employment context, including education, provision of goods, services and accommodation, disposal of property and private registered clubs. The Act covers all goods and services which are available to the public, whether on payment or not and irrespective of whether provided by the public sector or private sector.</P>
    <P>Budgetary resources, suggestions three and four.</P>
    <P>The question of addressing the inclusion of a gender perspective in budgetary proposals has been addressed by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in response to a separate Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that the National Development Plan 2000-2006 which involves the spending of over £40 billion should support the achievement of equal opportunities between men and women. The goal of gender equality covers the whole plan including infrastructure and productive investment as well as the regional, human resources and peace programmes. The plan provides that project selection criteria must have regard to the equal opportunities objectives. The Government has also approved gender impact assessment guidelines to assist Government departments and implementing bodies in assessing the gender impact of their proposals.</P>
    <P>A special unit has been established within my department to support all implementing departments and delivery agencies to meet the equal opportunity objective in their programmes, measures and initiatives. This unit, the equal opportunities promotion and monitoring unit, provides an advisory, training and information service on issues relating to gender and the national development plan. It also provides assistance to departments in carrying out gender impact assessment of policy proposals drawn up <Col N="1080" /> in the context of the national development plan. Funding of £4 million has been allocated from the national development plan for this purpose.</P>
    <P>My department is also currently working on the development of a national plan for women for the period 2001 to 2005 which will be drawn up under the same priority actions or critical areas of concern as defined in the Beijing Platform for Action. Consultancy expertise has been engaged by my department to assist in drawing up a draft National Plan for Women, 2001-2005, which will be the basis for the consultation process. Finalisation of the national plan for women will involve a consultation process which will be as comprehensive and wide-ranging as possible.</P>
    <P>Raising awareness and fuelling public debate, suggestions seven, eight and nine.</P>
    <P>The consultation process, which will be held in connection with the national plan for women, will encourage public debate on the issues covered by the Beijing Platform for Action, as the national plan for women covers the same 12 critical areas of concern as the platform for action.</P>
    <P>The Government is supportive of the work of the Interparliamentary Union, which comprises representatives of Governments worldwide. Ireland is represented by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the Special Session of the United Nations general assembly on &ldquo;Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century&rdquo; which took place in June last year to mark five years since the United Nations fourth world conference on women in Beijing in 1995, Ireland Aid has long realised that women bear the brunt of financial and social inequity. As part of the preparation of and follow up to Beijing, Ireland Aid undertook a major review of existing gender activities in its programme. This led to the adoption of formal gender guidelines in 1996. Ireland Aid's approach attempts to consider the impact on both women and men as an integral part of all projects, from planning to implementation to monitoring and evaluation.</P>
    <P>The 1999 review of Ireland Aid carried out by the development assistance committee of the OECD favourably commented on Ireland's efforts to mainstream gender into our bilateral aid programmes. In addition, Ireland, together with its EU partners, continues to monitor EU projects to ensure that they comprehensively address gender issues.</P>
    <P>Enhancing women's political participation, suggestions ten, 11 and 12.</P>
    <P>Examples of measures taken by political parties to increase women's political participation include: establishing a women's group in each constituency with over 3,000 women members; giving full voting rights at candidate selection conventions to said women's groups; an action programme to encourage increased participation by women in politics and increased representation by women; appointing a Front Bench member with specific responsibility for gender proofing all party policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> The Electoral Act, 1997, provides for the public funding of political parties. Payments made are deemed to include,<i> inter alia,</i> provision for the expenditure by the party in respect of the promotion of participation by women in political activity. Annual returns are required to be made to the Public Offices Commission indicating the matters to which the funding was applied, including the amounts applied to the participation by women in political activity.</P>
    <P>The Equality for Women Measure, which my Department launched on 5 October 2000, also has provision for funding which can be availed of by political parties.</P>

    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): The sports capital programme for 2001 was advertised in mid December 2000, with a closing date of 9 February 2001, for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,450 applications were received, including one from the organisation in question. All applications are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      <P>The Government is fully committed to ensuring that each child with disabilities attending all schools receives the support they require to fully participate in education and reach their potential.</P>
      <P>The supports provided by my Department deliver extra teaching and child care services to special needs children, whether in groups or in individual settings. The level of support has regard to the number of children and their particular assessed needs. Where individuals or small groups of children are involved, the support may take the form of part-time teaching hours, or part-time child care support, or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, my Department has allocated more than 100 extra resource teachers and 27 extra <Col N="1135" /> special needs assistants to support children with special needs in the VEC sector. The process of allocating resources for such children is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Other measures undertaken by my Department, which will have a significant effect on provision for children with special needs, include the provision of a remedial teaching service to all first and second level schools and the establishment of the National Educational Psychological Service.</P>
    <P>Any post-primary school, which requires infrastructural modification to accommodate a pupil with a disability, may apply for capital funding to the building unit of my Department. Priority attention is accorded to these applications.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that each child with a disability receives the support he or she may require to fully participate in education and reach their potential.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully supportive of the efforts of disabled people's representative groups and individuals involved in developing the capacity for independent living of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The main focus of my Department's support for people with disabilities is on the delivery of school based services which are directed at enhancing the educational development of students with disabilities. Arising from a Government decision in October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers supporting children with special needs has increased from 104 to more than 945 full-time resource teacher equivalents. The number of special needs assistants supporting children with disabilities in the primary system has been increased from 299 to more than 1,750 over the same period.</P>
      <P>Funding has also been provided to facilitate the appointment of an escort on every special school transport service in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to funding school based support services for students with disabilities, my Department has funded an initiative undertaken by the Offaly Centre for Independent Living to develop a comprehensive user-friendly handbook which will inform people with disabilities about all special education support services available in the Offaly area. A report from the Offaly Centre for Independent Living on the outcome of this pro<Col N="1136" /> ject is currently being considered in my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department also supports the work of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland in providing classes for children with dyslexia outside of school hours. An annual funding allocation of £58,600 is made available to the association to support its work.</P>

      <P>The Bridge project was a targeted initiative which sought to prepare young adults with disabilities in the 16 to 18 age group for the transition from school life to adult living.</P>
      <P>The project was originally funded under the Youthstart initiative for the period 1996 to 1998. However, I understand that its application for renewed funding under Youthstart was unsuccessful because of the view taken by the adjudicating committee that its focus should be on testing new models of support which, if successful, should be mainstreamed by the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>Reports on the operation of the Bridge project have since been considered by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and officers of the NCCA have had discussions with representatives of the Bridge project.

      <P>The existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with a specific learning disability such as dyslexia. This area will continue to be given attention. In this context, I am looking forward to receiving shortly the report of the expert group set up to examine pre-service training programmes for primary teachers; this group was required to have regard to developments in relation to children with special needs.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, a national programme of training for learning support teachers &ndash; remedial &ndash; has been in place. At present, post-graduate courses for teachers at primary and post-primary levels are held in six centres in universities and in colleges of education. In the current academic year 102 primary teachers and 72 post-primary teachers are attending these courses.</P>
      <P>These courses in learning support education are supported and funded by the in-career development unit of my Department. The syllabus includes training in the diagnosis and identification of reading difficulties and in appropriate techniques for remediation. In particular, there is a focus on the problem of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, in relation to diagnosis and pedagogy.</P>
      <P>Many shorter courses for learning support teachers and other interested teachers in specific learning difficulties are supported financially by my Department. They are mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for learning support teachers have issued to primary schools. They deal comprehensively with the teaching of children with dyslexia. An intensive training programme based on the guidelines is at an advanced stage of development.</P>
      <P>I also established a task force in October of last year to examine educational provision for children with dyslexia. I expect to have the report and recommendations of the task force shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that the Higher Diploma in Education National University of Ireland applications centre issues offers for the higher diploma in education on behalf of the member universities. A non-refundable fee deposit of £200 is required to confirm each offer. The fee deposit is not discretionary and, my Department has been informed, is essential for the efficient and equitable implementation of acceptance procedures for all applicants. The fee is subsequently transferred to the fees office of the university in question to be offset against the cost of tuition fees for the course.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the third level maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. An approved course for the purposes of the higher education grant scheme is a full-time undergraduate course of a minimum duration of two years or a full-postgraduate course of a minimum duration of one year in an approved third level institution.</P>
      <P>If the students in question meet the terms and conditions of the higher education grants scheme, they are eligible for grant assistance towards maintenance and the cost of tuition fees for the course is met by the relevant local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eli<Col N="1140" /> gible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Students must be attending an undergraduate course, or a postgraduate course of not less than one-year duration, in order to be deemed eligible for assistance.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department recently received a report from the consultant architect in relation to the provision of a fence between the school to which the Deputy refers and housing to the rear. The staff in the building unit of my Department concurred with the findings and recommendations of the report. Accordingly the consultant has been requested to prepare tender documents for the provision of this fencing.</P>
      <P>My Department currently awaits receipt of the tender documentation.</P>
