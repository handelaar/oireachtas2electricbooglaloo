      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, I have the honour to extend a warm welcome to the Chairman of the Russian State Duma, Mr. Guennadi Seleznev, who is accompanied by a delegation of eight Members of the State Duma in Moscow who join us in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.</P>
      <P>Mr. Chairman, your visit demonstrates the continuing co-operation and friendship between our two parliaments and countries. I express the confident hope it will increase that co-operation and friendship and be to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 which deal with two topics. I propose to deal with the topics separately and will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received <Col N="2" /> notice from Deputy Connaughton and call on him to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to make available the £6 million development grant for the Galway greyhound track originally committed by Bord na gCon and announced by the Minister and which has recently been reduced to £3.1 million. Given the strategic importance of the track to developing the greyhound industry in the west, the £6 million should be made available.</P>

In regard to the second topic, I received notice from Deputy Joe Higgins and call on him to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

        <b>:</b> I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of critical, urgent and national importance, namely, the revelations made to the Cabi<Col N="3" /> net by senior officials in the Department of Health and Children that under-investment in the health system has been endemic, that capacity deficits remain and that £1.2 billion is needed to renew and replace equipment, and the failure of the Government to acknowledge this position and make an emergency plan to rectify the problems in the health service.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 22<i>a</i>, motion re Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport; No. 23, motion re Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Additional Functions) Order, 2001; and No. 6, Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 22<i>a</i>, shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on No. 23, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion within 90 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; and questions shall be taken today from 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a private notice question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m.; and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the minds of members of the all-party committee, both items are inextricably linked and we believe that accompanying legis<Col N="4" /> lation is necessary. I merely wish to establish whether the Taoiseach has designated a Minister with responsibility to bring forward that legislation and if he can indicate when it might be ready.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we can be of help. I welcome support for the motion. Whether the legislation, which is privilege legislation, is required is under consideration by the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General. I hope they will be able to make a decision on the matter shortly.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal agreed to? Agreed. The next proposal deals with No. 23, motion re Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Additional Functions) Order, 2001. Is it agreed to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir. This side of the House will not agree to the ordering of normal business today until such time as an explanation is given as to the reason the House was treated with contempt by the Government in the past three days in withholding vital information available to the Cabinet since last Monday week on the dreadful state of the health service. The information was withheld while a litany of Ministers and Deputies painted an altogether inaccurate picture. The task for the Ceann Comhairle is to determine the difference between telling the House lies and withholding vital information in the course of a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the revelations in today's newspaper about the recent special Cabinet meeting on health, can the Taoiseach explain his analysis that Ireland has an excellent and well resourced health service when we have the lowest<i> per capita</i> spend on health in the EU, waiting lists in the two main north Dublin hospitals, Beaumont and the Mater, have risen by 30% since he became Taoiseach and a 70 year old man in his constituency has had appointments to attend the neurological section of the Mater Hospital cancelled eight times and will now not be seen until September? Can the Taoiseach say why an 82 year old woman in his constituency had to wait 53 hours on a trolley in the Mater Hospital over the past two weeks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why the information in today's newspapers, which was given to Ministers last Monday week at a special Cabinet meeting, was withheld from the House during the debates on health in recent days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Information was not withheld from the House. The Minister comprehensively replied to the motion asking him to account for the issues that had been raised in the health service over the past three or four years. The meeting last week was held to prepare the first review of the health service in seven years and to make sure we devise a comprehensive strategy for the future. We received nine presentations from officials in the Department of Health and Children and those consulted who work with officials in the Department. Some of the data in those presentations was in this morning's newspapers. Most of the issues were raised at the meeting. It excluded the first presentation which outlined in great detail the improvements in services, resources, the cancer strategy and areas such as mental health and physical and sensory disabilities, halving the cardiac waiting list, and the enormous capital programme which has helped many services not only hospital services, but extended community health services. In the limited time I had to check the article, it seems most of the other issues were addressed. Following on from what the Minister said, the Government is determined to move away from the type of hit and miss policy which has been often the case in the health services in the past. That is why we decided to have an indepth review of the issues which arise out of a series of reports the Minister for Health and Children has commissioned and to hear about the consultation process which is underpinning the new health strategy. There was a complaint in the past that the health strategies were rushed. We will not make the same mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to section 4(4)(<i>c</i>) of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, Dáil Éireann approves the draft order:</P>
      <P>Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Additional Functions) Order, 2001</P>
      <P>a copy of which, in draft form, was laid before Dáil Éireann on Thursday, 17 May 2001.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be familiar with the background to the making of this order. Initial concerns in this matter first surfaced a decade ago, raised by a number of former residents of children's homes. A number of vaccine trials which had been undertaken on children in care in Ireland in the 1960s and 1970s were brought to public attention in the early 1990s. A question was answered in the Dáil in May 1991 and in 1997 my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, promised to have inquiries made into the matter, following which he would consider what was the most appropriate course of action to take. The chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children, Dr. Jim Kiely, was asked to investigate and his report, &ldquo;Report on three Clinical Trials involving babies and children in institutional settings 1960/61, 1970 and 1973&rdquo;, was laid before both Houses in November 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trial No. 1, published in 1962, looked at what would happen if four vaccines &ndash; diptheria, whooping cough, tetanus and polio &ndash; were combined in one. At the time the standard approach was to administer tetanus vaccine &ndash; DPT &ndash; and polio vaccines separately, at different times and at different injection sites. Trial No. 2, published in 1971, was to find out if German measles vaccine, administered intranasally, could spread to susceptible contacts. Trial No. 3 was carried out during 1973 but was not published. It compared the propensity of commercially available batches <Col N="28" /> of Trivax vaccine and Trivax AD vaccine to produce adverse reactions, as against the capacity of a modified equivalent vaccine to produce the same reactions. The modified vaccine had fewer organisms per dose.</P>
    <P>From the moment I became Minister for Health and Children I have been aware of this issue. I have, on a number of occasions, met representatives of past residents of a number of children's homes and I am aware of and understand their anxieties in this matter. Following the publication of the chief medical officer's report, I arranged with the chief executive officers of relevant health boards that, where supporting documentary evidence is available, former residents could be immediately informed whether they were part of any of these trials. In addition, I have ensured that a counselling service is available from the health boards for any former resident of a children's home involved in such trials.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officer's report indicated that the trials appear not to have had medically negative consequences for the children involved. The trials were looking at marginal degrees of difference in the vaccines administered, not at experimental, unproved or dangerous drugs. We must also remember that the protocols of the time are not necessarily those which apply today, more than 30 years later. From my reading of the chief medical officer's report I am not satisfied that it has been established that solid informed consent was given by the people who were entitled to give it. The issue of consent is fundamental. These children were in the care of the State and we must establish if the State fulfilled its obligations to them.</P>
    <P>Having read the report with great care and discussed it in some detail with the chief medical officer, I was convinced that further investigations were warranted. The State must act to protect and safeguard the rights of all children in its care. Having considered the report in the context of available mechanisms for investigation, I decided that the most appropriate route for further inquiry would be through the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, chaired by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy. For that reason, in November last year, I referred the chief medical officer's report to the commission so that it could be considered as part its investigations.</P>
    <P>The Laffoy commission offers the best mechanism available to us to probe these issues and to ensure that the totality of issues can be examined in an expeditious and rigorous manner. The commission has a full range of powers and personnel, an experienced secretariat, a strong panel of experts with the requisite qualifications and an investigative and legal infrastructure, all up and running. Much of what the Laffoy commission is currently investigating runs parallel in timescale to the chief medical officer's report, so the search methods for documents going back to the 1950s is already in place.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to thank Ms Justice Laffoy for having agreed to take on <Col N="29" /> this additional task. At the time of referring the report to the Laffoy commission last November, some questions were asked about its capacity to deal with an issue such as this. At the time, the Attorney General advised me and the Taoiseach that the subject matter of the chief medical officer's report falls within the definition of &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; in the 2000 Act and that the commission has the competence to inquire into the vaccines report. Ms Justice Laffoy agreed with this view. While the issue of the commission's competency to investigate had been clarified to the Government's satisfaction by the Attorney General's advice, the Taoiseach and I also stated that the issue of whether the commission might require additional powers by way of a Government order to assist the inquiry into the vaccines report would be a matter for further consideration by the commission and that if such an order were deemed necessary it would be brought before both Houses for approval.</P>
    <P>Subsequent communications between Ms Justice Laffoy and the Attorney General concerned the aforementioned question of additional powers which might be required by the commission to assist in its inquiries into the chief medical officer's report. It was ultimately agreed between the commission and the Attorney General that any possible conflict of interest difficulties on the part of the current membership of the commission, presented by the vaccines report, could be resolved by the expansion of the commission. The proposed expansion of membership will facilitate the commission in its investigation of the vaccines report and my Department is currently working with the Department of Education and Science with regard to the selection of an appropriate nominee. I expect to be in a position to agree a suitable nominee with the Minister for Education and Science within the next few days.</P>
    <P>During the course of discussions between the Attorney General and the commission, Ms Justice Laffoy also requested that, for the purposes of clarity and certainty, the parameters of the inquiry into the chief medical officer's report be incorporated into a Government order. The Attorney General agreed with this approach and suggested a Government order in this regard. My Department was advised of this conclusion in February this year and the drafting of the proposed order commenced shortly thereafter. Consultations subsequently took place with the commission itself, the Attorney General's office, the Department of Education and Science and the parliamentary counsel's office, following which the draft order was submitted for Government approval earlier this month and laid before both Houses last Thursday, 17 May.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the draft order is to define the parameters of the commission's inquiry into the vaccines report. The Government may, under section 4 of the Commission on Child Abuse Act, 2000, by order confer on the commission and its committees additional functions or powers connected with their functions and powers. The pro<Col N="30" /> posed order provides for additional functions to be conferred on the commission as follows: to inquire, through the investigation committee, into the circumstances, legality, conduct, ethical propriety and effects on the subjects thereof of &ndash; (i) the three vaccine trials referred to in the report and (ii) any systematic trials of a vaccine or the mode of delivery thereof to test its efficacy or to ascertain its side effects on a person found by the investigation committee to have taken place during the period commencing on 1 January 1940 and ending on 31 December 1987 and to have been conducted in an institution, following an allegation by a person that he or she as a child in the institution was a subject thereof; and to prepare and publish to the general public, in such manner and at such time as the commission may determine, a report in writing specifying the determinations made by the investigation committee in its report under article 4 of this order.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 4 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, a draft of the order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made unless a resolution approving the draft is passed by each House. A resolution approving the draft was passed in the Seanad yesterday.</P>
    <P>The issues raised in the chief medical officer's report require investigation by the Laffoy commission. These are important questions concerning fundamental issues of the rights of children in care and the nature of consent which needs to be asked in a context which offers the competence to thoroughly investigate the issues. The draft order and the proposed expansion of the commission's membership will allow the commission to progress matters without delay. I ask Members of this House to support the resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulties with the Minister's approach to this matter. He is neither statesmanlike nor parliamentarian in regard to his accountability to this House. We have witnessed this during Question Time when questions have not been answered and when they are answered &ndash; as in the case of a question for which I recently waited six weeks for a reply &ndash; the information is incomplete. The Minister still has not corrected the record on that matter but I expect he will do so in due course.</P>
      <P>The Minister's tardiness extends to almost all of his functions. There is such a high number of reviews, committees and inquiries under way in the Department &ndash; I calculated a figure in the region of 58 &ndash; that civil servants do not appear to have the time to compile replies to parliamentary questions. The Department of Health and Children will soon have the biggest budget and greatest expenditure of all Departments &ndash; this may already be the case &ndash; yet the Minister constantly complains about the number of parliamentary questions tabled.</P>
      <P>I raised certain concerns when this issue was previously debated in the House. On 9 November 2000, I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> By sending the report to the Laffoy commission, the role of the Department of Health and Children will be lost in a welter of detail. It is to Dáil Éireann that the Minister for Health and Children, his Department and agencies must account. For that reason alone, the report should be examined in detail by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children which should have powers to send for persons, papers and records and to compel the attendance of witnesses. The committee was led to believe that the report would be sent to it and that the Department of Health and Children, an actor in this saga, should itself decide where the report goes raises serious questions. This is a smoke bomb, a three card trick. The Minister for Health and Children is buying cover for himself and his Department at the expense of the reputations of people who are certainly not in the category of child molesters or physical or sexual child abusers. I have no doubt that many of the people mentioned in the report have questions to answer and, in all this, we must be centrally concerned about the former residents of the institutions, the children to whom the report refers. However, I contend that their rights, needs and best interests are also being abused by the Minister referring the report to the Laffoy commission which is dealing with abuse <i>per se</i>.</P>
    <P>I proceeded to cite the responsibilities with which the commission had been charged which included the establishment of as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions. The commission was also charged with affording victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, the clear view of the Attorney General and the commission's chairperson is that the commission has the competence to investigate the vaccines report. However, Ms Justice Laffoy suggested it would be helpful, for the sake of clarity, if the terms of reference of the commission's investigation into the vaccines report were to be incorporated in a Government order. This course of action has been agreed following consultation between the commission and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, slipped in some words on which I would like clarification. He stated:</P>
    <P>At the time of referring the report to the Laffoy commission last November, some questions were asked about its capacity to deal with an issue such as this. At the time, the Attorney General advised me and the Taoiseach that the subject matter of the chief medical officer's report falls within the definition of &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; in the 2000 Act and that the commission has the competence to inquire into the vaccines report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> I draw particular attention to the use of the word &ldquo;competence&rdquo;. The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>It was ultimately agreed between the commission and the Attorney General that any possible conflict of interest difficulties on the part of the current membership of the commission, presented by the vaccines report, could be resolved by the expansion of the commission. The proposed expansion of membership will facilitate the commission in its investigation of the current vaccines report and my Department is currently working with the Department of Education and Science with regard to the selection of an appropriate nominee.</P>
    <P>What effect will expanding the commission at this stage have on the preliminary work it has already carried out? Could somebody go to the courts in the future and argue that all members of the commission were not involved in the report from start to finish, thereby leading to some or all of its findings being set aside?</P>
    <P>What is behind the reference to a conflict of interest? There is no detail in that regard. To what specifically is the Minister referring? Where does the possibility of a conflict of interest arise? Is it the case that an existing member of the commission may be in a conflicting position? To what does it relate? If there is potential for a conflict of interest in the commission, perhaps the issue should not be referred to that body. I ask the Minister to specifically explain the reference because it is not clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister has developed a persecution complex. He does not appear to realise that this is an adversarial system. He has a huge Department which, of all Departments, will have the largest budget this year. It has a huge number of civil servants, PR people, consultants, drivers, aides and assistants. My job and that of Deputy McManus is to prosecute the Minister on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party in opposition, but we do not have anybody to assist us. Our job is to prosecute and test the Minister, ask him questions and hold him accountable. Deputy McManus can speak for herself &ndash; she is capable of doing so eloquently &ndash; but the Minister does not extend to me the courtesy I deserve as the Fine Gael Party's spokesperson on health. For example, the medical manpower report was given to all and sundry. It was leaked several times and then published. However, nobody had the courtesy to send me a copy. I recently received one from the Department although I had already received one from another source in the meantime. These are basic courtesies.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not accurately answer questions in the House and it takes six weeks to answer questions that should be answered in three days. For example, I tabled a similar ques<Col N="33" /> tion to every Department and most replied in three days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shadow the Department of Health and Children where everything is done by PR. The Minister denied that he was responsible for the leak in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning. However, he was responsible for the leaks in the Sunday newspapers the day before the Ballymascanlon meeting. He briefed widely on the issues he intended to raise. Those who receive the least information are the Members of the House to whom the Minister is constitutionally accountable.</P>
      <P>I will not tolerate this ball of smoke any longer. The gloves will come off if the Minister continues to use terms such as &ldquo;infantile&rdquo; as he did on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently and other provocative terms such as the ones he used on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; when he said the Opposition was making cheap jibes at him by asking reasonable questions. We will be forced to treat him with the contempt such responses deserve. I want accountability and the Minister to explain the reason it was necessary to introduce this order when he said previously that the Attorney General and the Government were of the view that everything was fine. What is specifically meant by the phrase &ldquo;ultimately agreed&ldquo;? Does it mean the commission would not accept the line offered by the Government? I also ask the Minister to specifically explain his reference to extending the commission because of a possibility of a conflict of interest. The House is entitled to know. It is my job to ask that question and the Minister's job to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We were all astonished to receive notification that this matter would come before the House. It was debated last November and when I raised serious concerns on behalf of the Labour Party about the legality of the Minister's approach, plenty of reassurances were given. The impression was also given that everything was nicely set up and that it was a streamlined and efficient way to deal with an issue that had to be investigated because young children had been taken advantage of and used as guinea pigs. A commission is the best vehicle for such an investigation, although I do not have the same confidence in the Department and the Minister for Health and Children as I have in the principle of this type of commission investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 November 2000, I raised concerns that I considered needed to be addressed. Six months later, however, this item relating to the definition of additional powers is before the House to ensure the commission can carry out its work. This is unacceptable. It is not proper practice for a Minister to take a particular approach and indicate that it is the best way forward, but then leave it to languish because issues arose since then that are only now being addressed in the order. I <Col N="34" /> pointed out at the time that there were dangers if the matter was not carried out properly and that ultimately it might not fulfil its capability or deliver on its objective.</P>
    <P>I note the Attorney General's view that there are no issues around the definition of abuse. However, my view is that there are such issues, but the order granting additional powers gets around that problem and saves the Attorney General's face because nobody will have to admit that he or she is wrong. I refer the Minister to the points I made about whether injecting somebody can be considered an injury. I questioned that point strongly at the time. Personal injury is covered in the jurisdiction of the investigation and it appears, from a legal perspective, that there was a serious issue in that regard. I recall that one of the vaccines tested involved a nasal spray and it would be extremely difficult, even for the Attorney General who is very good at explaining points, to prove that the giving of a nasal spray to a child could be defined as a personal injury.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, six months later, we are dealing with an issue that should have been put to bed long ago. A curious element is the expansion of the commission. The Minister did not explain this point clearly and should do so. It appears there is now a need to expand the commission and select a nominee. However, the name of the nominee was not given to the House; that will be done in the next few days. I find it difficult to comprehend that the Minister for Health and Children does not appreciate the frustration and anger Deputies, who are democratically elected, experience when he operates in a way that means that information that is required is not provided.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am bruised and scarred after two evenings of debate involving flimflam and fairy tales, but the Minister has been extraordinarily determined to work around problems rather than face them, to avoid rather than give the hard answers and to avoid dealing even with relatively simple issues, such as this, in an up-front manner. Given this, it not surprising nobody believes him when he said he did not leak or cause to leak information to <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning. This approach is contrary to the direct answers Ministers for Health are required to give when dealing with such complex and difficult areas as health. They require attention.</P>
    <P>From time to time we in the Opposition are more than happy to give our support, as I did in this instance, even when I was criticised by Fine Gael. We were happy to support the Minister on this issue but I am less than happy now in view of changes to be made that have not been fully explained. The issue of a conflict of interest has not been explained. I look forward to the Minister outlining how this is an issue here. He may say there is a potential conflict of interest but it is startling to find from his speech that it has become an issue.</P>
    <P>We must remember the context in which this is being done. We are concerned with children who <Col N="35" /> were in the care of the State but were, in effect, abandoned and left to be abused, both physically and sexually, by those who were supposed to care for them. This is a small part of that dreadful, tragic picture but it is one we need to learn from, not just for the sake of those children who have now grown up but for all those who are being cared for at present, including those in the hospitals who presume those caring for them have their best interests at heart. They should be able to continue in that presumption.</P>
    <P>However, when the issue of what happened to women who were patients at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is examined &ndash; it is an issue I recently raised by way of parliamentary question &ndash; it is clear they were abandoned by the normal protections and safeguards people should expect to have. The outcome was devastating for them. Given this, there are lessons we must continue to learn and when learnt, we must ensure the knowledge is applied universally. Historically, when things happened to children and women they were not as important. Despite the enormous social and cultural changes in the country we should not presume those attitudes have gone. The recent history of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital tell us something very significant.</P>
    <P>The work of the Laffoy commission should equally inform us about practice today. It is, therefore, extremely important that this work is done properly and correctly. We appear to be getting an inquiry within an inquiry even though initially the Minister made a strong case that by giving this work to the Laffoy commission we could ensure there was a complete approach, that the system had been designed and agreed by the House. I supported that.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell deal with openness, accountability and fair dealings by the Minister. For the last two months I requested a copy of the report of the Medical Manpower Forum from his Department but it was not sent to me. However, now, like the 84 bus, I have been getting a copy of the report every day. The report was published in January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister please accept what I am saying? The date of January is on the front cover of the report. Interestingly, no credit is given to the producers of the report. I contacted Comhairle when I had given up on the Department. It was issuing reports to people but it did not consider it appropriate to give me a copy as it took the view that the Department should have given me one. We know so much more about the health services today than we did yesterday, when there was a lengthy debate on them, because today <i>The Irish Times </i>has the knowledge and information this House was denied. In view of this, will the Minister ensure that when the bed capacity report is completed &ndash; the Taoiseach appears to believe it is already <Col N="36" /> completed but the Minister says he has only preliminary information &ndash; Members of the House who are spokespeople on Health are at least accorded the respect of being issued with a copy of the report ahead of the press and media launch?</P>
      <P>The Minister's record on this is very poor and this is the least he can do to rebuild trust. I supported him when it could have been politically opportunist to take another route but I chose not to do so. However, that respect has not been reciprocated. The fairy tales I had to listen to over the last two nights indicate how adrift the Government is. Despite being four years in power its main purpose is not to develop a health policy but to shift the blame around so that somebody other than the Minister is responsible for this mess.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is being painted as the bad cop while the Minister is being painted as the good cop. I do not accept that analysis. There is such a thing as Cabinet responsibility and the Taoiseach being a leader of the Government. It is remarkable that every time the issue of health is raised with the Taoiseach he tries to fob it away. The head is down as he indicates he is not the person responsible. He still thinks the health service is excellent and when any person criticises it he pretends it is the nurses who are being criticised. He cannot understand or accept that there is such a thing as leadership and responsibility for the health service and, most frustratingly, there is an historic opportunity which the Government has failed to grasp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this motion and I thank the Minister for referring it to the Laffoy commission. It is a positive step and is long overdue. Previous speakers have criticised the Minister on the basis that he did not act fast enough and that he should have published the report earlier. That may be so but it is now being brought to the Laffoy commission and will be investigated. That is a positive development which should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I will address the broader issue of the background to this abuse. These three trials were carried out because Welcome, the main manufacturers of the DPT at the time, were very concerned about reports of adverse reactions to the three-in-one vaccine coming from the Eastern Health Board. The Eastern Health Board was the main purchasing agent for the Department of Health and they distributed that vaccine throughout the country. In the early 1970s there were a number of reports to the Welcome Foundation from the Eastern Health Board expressing concern about the amount of adverse reactions to the vaccine. The main reason officials wrote to Welcome was fear of adverse publicity which could damage the reputation of the vaccination programme. That is an issue I will return to in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis for the trials was to improve performance and reduce adverse reactions and side <Col N="37" /> effects of the Trivax vaccine. These included fever, fits and other more serious reactions like brain damage, as highlighted by the Kenneth Best case. A diluted vaccine was used in the trial to investigate the efficacy of the vaccine without causing adverse reactions. There are serious question marks hanging over this vaccine and its manufacturer, so much so that Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, in the Best case, described Welcome as negligent and criticised the company's quality control procedures. Even some of the staff within Welcome questioned whether they should continue to manufacture the vaccine because of those adverse reactions and complaints. However, the batch administered to Kenneth Best was administered to at least 243 other Irish children in 1968 and 1969. The Department has not acted on this information and we still do not know if those children have been traced nearly two years later. A further 15 children were offered a once-off <i>ex gratia</i> payment in 1982 by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Woods, of £10,000 due to the probability that they were brain damaged by the vaccine. It is also claimed in the report, which predated the decision to refer this to the Laffoy Commission, that the National Drugs Advisory Board did not raise any objection to the trials when approval was sought. However, the board did not even approve the Trivax vaccine until 1978 up to which point all that was required was a license to import it from the UK.</P>
    <P>During the late 1960s and early 1970s there was an increase in the number of adverse reactions to the Trivax vaccine and a question mark over whether it should be continued. The Eastern Health Board was inundated with reports of severe reactions among children in 1973 and wrote to Welcome expressing its concern. While the records for the period are poor, it is a fact that three lots of the vaccine had at least 73 adverse reactions in the Eastern Health Board region, some of which required hospitalisation. There are many families who now hope the Minister will have the courage of his convictions and will carry out a thorough investigation into the Trivax scandal. The lives of those involved have been damaged through their use in the vaccine trial programme but those behind the initiation of those trials have yet to hear the truth and the families await a report on the whole Trivax issue. Serious questions have been asked of the Department and Welcome but neither organisation has been willing to give a full and frank account of its handling of the administration of the three-in-one vaccine. The only way to get to the full truth is if the records of the Department and the health boards are made available to an inquiry or Dáil committee so that these matters can be fully investigated.</P>
    <P>It is sad, talking 30 and 40 years on, to see some of those children whom the parents are adamant have been damaged by the Trivax vaccine, some of them even more latterly. There are two distinct issues here and we have to be conscious of that. The question of the initiation of the trials in the <Col N="38" /> 1960s and 1970s is one of manufacture and whether proper procedures were put in place. The legislation and regulations in place at that time were questionable and there was an onus on the Welcome Foundation to ensure that it adhered to good manufacturing practices. As to parents who claim their children have been damaged subsequent to that, we cannot dispute the statistical probability that children may have severe adverse reaction to a particular vaccine and may, in occasional cases, become brain damaged. Absolutely no scientific report will contradict that, so much so that in the United Kingdom, this time last year, a decision was taken to put a no-fault compensation procedure in place for such children, damaged in all probability by the administration of a vaccine. To the credit of the Department of Health in the UK, it has admitted a risk, though it may only be small, that some children may end up being damaged by the administration of a state-sponsored vaccination programme. They have a maximum cap of £100,000.</P>
    <P>It is a huge worry for many of those parents today, many of whom are now becoming elderly, as to what will happen to their son or daughter after they pass away. God help the poor families that signed up out of sheer desperation in 1982 and 1983 and accepted the £10,000 once-off payment and final settlement in relation to any outstanding liability on the part of the Department of Health. That money would not have, and never will provide for what is needed for those children. The Minister should seriously look at what has been put in place in the United Kingdom because there are a number of instances where in all probability children have been brain damaged by a vaccination programme. If I could have the Minister's attention, just for one split second, to give him an insight into the three-in-one vaccine, I have here the report on adverse reactions to the Trivax vaccine the Irish Medical Board received. I am sure the same is true for other vaccination programmes. Thankfully many of those children fully recovered and there was no problem, but the principle is that these cases arise. There is no question of that, as the United Kingdom Government has recognised and, though we can argue about statistical probability, we should put in place a similar measure to theirs along with looking at the issue of the initiation of these vaccine trials. Those are two distinct courses of action.</P>
    <P>Such action would help to ensure additional confidence in our vaccination programme and, as the Minister knows, there are also question marks over the administration of the polio vaccination programme. I hope we can get clarification as to how this out of date vaccine was administered to children because the Department of Health and Children and the health boards say they did not issue it. General practitioners say that if they administered out of date vaccines it was because they received out of date vaccines. Someone is at fault and parents deserve to know how this hap<Col N="39" /> pened. That is a basic question which needs to be answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact this matter is before the House today and that the terms of reference of the Laffoy Commission will be extended in the manner detailed by the Minister. However, I want to make some points about this and the manner in which the commission has been treated to date by the Government.</P>
      <P>In 1997 when I was Fine Gael spokesperson for health and Deputy Cowen was Minister for Health, I raised the issue of children in residential homes in the State being used as guinea pigs in the trial of pharmaceutical products. While I welcome the fact the motion is in the House today, I question why it has taken four years for this matter to be given to any form of commission of inquiry. I am aware of the report into the issue which was published. I agree with the Minister who said he is not satisfied from the information available that any proper consents were given for the children concerned to be used in these trials. That indicates the need to have this matter better investigated. From everything I know about the background to this issue and from the report published, I share the Minister's concerns. I do not believe from the knowledge currently available to us that proper consents were given. These children were seen as the detritus of society. They were abandoned children who were sitting in a residential home and who could be used to the benefit of pharmaceutical companies in the trials undertaken. It is a disgrace and one of the many revelations of scandal concerning the manner in which our residential homes were run, the lack of supervision and controls and the failure to acknowledge the need to ensure that when children were in a residential home or institution, either under the care of the State or totally or partially funded by the State, proper standards were maintained.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether the powers being given to the Laffoy Commission will entitle it to require the pharmaceutical companies responsible to attend before it and to give evidence if the commission seeks it. I want the Minister to give us an assurance that the new scheme for the payment of legal expenses or legal aid for those who come before the commission will not be extended to the pharmaceutical companies which profited from the use of children in trials. I want the Minister to confirm that the scheme for the payment of legal expenses will apply to persons who may now wish to give evidence to the commission of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting &ndash; it was a view expressed on this side of the House &ndash; that a motion was required to be passed in this House to give the commission of inquiry these powers. The Minister side-stepped that issue by saying that he, his Department or the Attorney General's office did not think it required a motion. However, Ms Justice Laffoy, who is an eminent and competent <Col N="40" /> member of the High Court Judiciary and who is the chairman of this commission, indicated that she thought it was necessary for a motion to be passed. The fact there was disagreement about this has further delayed this issue going within the remit of the commission. The disagreement was regrettable. What we are dealing with today should have been dealt with many months ago.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the functioning of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Just over two years ago the Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, apologised to the victims of child abuse for the State's neglect of them as children when they were in residential homes as a result, in many instances, of State intervention to take them into care. The manner in which the commission to inquire into child abuse has been treated by the Government is a scandal and a disgrace. This commission, which has been in place for a substantial period of time, has been prevented from undertaking much of the work which falls within its remit by the Government's utter failure to address issues directly relevant to it carrying out its work. It took until May of this year for a scheme for the payment of legal expenses to be finally agreed with the Department of Education and Science which would extend to the victims of abuse the facility to be legally represented and assisted in presenting their circumstances and traumas to the commission of inquiry. Why did it take this long? I do not understand why it took this long.</P>
    <P>In the context of the commission's own work, it indicated the importance of providing a scheme of legal aid for these people who are already victims of the State. On 20 July 2000 the commission adjourned its sittings to facilitate a scheme to be put in place. On 26 September 2000 the commission held a further public sitting and detailed the necessity to put such a scheme in place. The commission in an interim report, which has become available only this week, details the fact that it took in the region of ten months for the Department of Education and Science and the Government to make a decision on and adequately address this issue. We only now have the scheme available. That clearly indicates the hollow words expressed by the Taoiseach in his apology two years ago. There has been a total failure by the Government to recognise that the serious issues arising as a consequence of the scandalous abuse of children within our residential institutions deserved, when we finally got around to recognising the need to deal with them, to be given a priority by Government. However, they were not. It is like everything else with which this Government deals in that eventually a decision meanders through a bureaucratic system. As a consequence of the Government's failure, the work of the commission has been put back by 12 months.</P>
    <P>We also have Government proposals for the provision of compensation for the victims of abuse. Many of the victims of abuse made it clear that they wished the commission to have a com<Col N="41" /> pensation function. I want to make a declaration of interest, which I have made in this House on a number of occasions when addressing these issues. My law firm represents a small number of victims of abuse who wish to present their cases to the commission and who will be pressing claims for compensation. I have knowledge of this issue not just as a public representative but as a lawyer whose firm is dealing with such cases. I am not primarily dealing with them; another colleague of mine is doing that. I do not want any misunderstanding about whether I have an interest in this issue. My interest is to ensure that justice is done and that this House does it job properly.</P>
    <P>It took the Government until March of this year to produce a draft proposal for compensation payments to be made. That proposal, which was published in March of this year, stated that the scheme would be established under statute with priority to be given to the enactment of the Bill with a view to its enactment before the summer recess, followed by immediate establishment of the compensation body. No Bill has yet been published or circulated. The legislation will not be passed before the summer recess. Just as the Government failed to prioritise the provision of legal assistance for the victims of abuse, it has failed to prioritise the publication of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Victims of abuse do not want to find themselves in two different forums, having to give background details of the abuse they suffered. The scheme envisages that a different body from the commission of inquiry will deal with the compensation issue. This means that on two separate occasions victims will have to tell their story. I urge the Minister to ensure, in whatever Bill is ultimately published, victims do not have to describe their trauma twice. On page five of the draft proposal it is stated that, &ldquo;a possible solution to this difficulty would be to provide that the compensation body be given an option to rely, in whole or in part, on a transcript of evidence given to the commission, and thus obviate the need for repetition of evidence.&rdquo; I urge the Government that a provision to enable matters to be so dealt with be contained in the Bill, when it gets round to publishing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate. From day one, I was of the view that the issues contained in the three reports deserved to be considered by a body which had the necessary competence and powers in terms of the compellibility of witnesses and discovery of documentation. The Laffoy commission was the obvious forum to take on board an investigation into questions that remained unanswered in relation to the conduct of vaccine trials. I regret that it has taken this length of time between the original referral of the report to the Laffoy commission, which occured last November, and the making of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> When I spoke in the House in November, issues were raised about the legal competence of the Laffoy commission to consider the report. Deputy McManus raised the issue of what constituted abuse. The Attorney General was very clear in his advice at the time. The definition of abuse contained in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, clearly encompasses the activity alleged in the conduct of the vaccine trials.</P>
    <P>It was also made clear in my speech on 16 November 2000 that the Attorney General had been informed that the Laffoy commission proposed to consider the issues raised by the report as a separate heading within its inquiry. The commission is considering whether an order under section 4(4) is necessary or appropriate to assist it in this respect. It is the Government's intention to fully consult with it on the issue, as envisaged by the Act, and make any necessary order under section 4(4). If any such order is made, it will require the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000. Sound political and administrative institutions, supported and trusted by the people, are one of the hallmarks of an advanced society and are crucial ingredients for a successful economy.</P>
      <P>It is essential that our citizens have confidence and trust in Government and public administration. It is clearly important that we have an appropriate legal framework in place to ensure that their trust is not abused. There is a particular duty for those of us in political life to set a high standard of conduct as misconduct and corruption at the political level creates and appears to excuse an atmosphere and culture of cynicism which invites corruption at lower levels. The Standards in Public Office Bill before us gives an opportunity to further reinforce the integrity of our political system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill must also be considered in the context <Col N="45" /> of the raft of major legislative measures in recent years in the general area of governance and accountability. The major items of legislation already on the statute book include the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which has put in place a more modern accountability framework for the Civil Service. Another significant Act introduced in recent years is the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, which provides citizens with a legal right of access to official and personal information, subject to certain exemptions and ensuring privacy rights are upheld, and encompassing an independent appeals system in the form of the Information Commissioner. The commissioner's basic function is to safeguard the rights of individuals to official information and reasons for decisions which particularly affect them.</P>
    <P>The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, gives Oireachtas Committees increased powers of investigation in areas of public concern. Among these powers is the ability to compel witnesses to attend hearings and to respond to questions.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, provides mechanisms for dealing with conflicts of interest in relation to members of the Houses, Ministers and officials in the Civil Service and the wider public service. It established the independent Public Offices Commission and provided for a Select Committee on Members' Interests in each House of the Oireachtas, to oversee its key provisions. It requires Members of the Oireachtas, senior civil servants, public board members and senior executives of State bodies to disclose their personal interests in order to provide transparency in decision-making and accountability. The requirements of the Ethics Act represent a loss of privacy for these categories of people, particularly Members of the Houses whose interests are published. However, this loss of privacy is accepted in order to ensure democratic accountability. Deputies are aware that a large part of the Standards in Public Office Bill builds on the foundations laid by the Ethics Act.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Acts of 1997 and 1998 seek to achieve fairness in the electoral process by limiting expenditure at elections and providing a system of recoupment, of candidates' elections expenses in certain circumstances. They also provide for a scheme of disclosure of political donations over specified limits. The Electoral Acts serve to reassure the public that there is openness and accountability in the relationship between the political system and those that support it financially or otherwise. The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act, 1999, provides similar measures for the local authority area.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill is one of a range of legislative initiatives currently being taken by the Government in the broad area of standards and conduct in public life. Other initiatives include the Prevention of Corruption <Col N="46" /> (Amendment) Bill, which is currently before the House and which represents a considerable strengthening of our anti-corruption laws. This Bill provides for a significant widening of the scope of the Prevention of Corruption Acts by bringing within their scope office holders such as Deputies, Senators, MEPS, members and officials of the EU, judges of national, foreign and international courts and certain other foreign public officials where the corrupt act occurs wholly or partly in the State. In addition, the offence of corruption will be given extra-territorial effect in its application to Irish office holders and officials, so that the offence of corruption would apply even where the corruption occurs abroad.</P>
    <P>Another important provision of the Bill deals with situations where an officeholder or official acts corruptly on his or her own initiative to secure some benefit, either personally or for another person. Here, there is no offer or receipt of a benefit from a third party but the person's actions are designed to benefit, for example, a member of their family. This type of corruption in office is being tackled for the first time in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000. Deputies will be aware that the Taoiseach's substantial statement in December of last year included the announcement of an amendment to the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill to provide that there will be a presumption that a public official has acted corruptly in certain circumstances where the person has received moneys or benefits from someone who stood to benefit from the actions of the official.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, will, subject to Government approval, bring forward on Committee Stage, amendments to the Whistleblowers Protection Bill, 1999 &ndash; a Private Members Bill introduced in the Dáil by Deputy Rabbitte. This Bill was accepted by the Government in principle on Second Stage subject to amendments being proposed on Committee Stage following consultations with the interested parties and following the advice of the Attorney General. Its purpose, as currently drafted, is to provide protection from civil liability to employees who make certain disclosures &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo; in relation to the conduct of the business and affairs of their employers. The Bill also prohibits penalisation of employees by their employers in such circumstances. It is also the intention to amend on Committee Stage both the Bill before us today and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill to allow for protections for persons making disclosures in the context of those two Bills.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will also bring forward proposals in relation to a registration system for lobbyists who lobby officials and politicians at national and local level. As these proposals will bear directly on the operations of the Oireachtas, and as the Constitution vests responsibility for such matters in each House, the Minister of State will consult the <Col N="47" /> membership of the Houses on his proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>Among the main aims of the Local Government Bill, 2000, published by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is the introduction of a comprehensive ethics framework for local authority members and officials. The provisions of this Bill mirror in many respects the transparency and accountability arrangements of the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Whistleblowers Bill, Fine Gael and Labour have published Bills on registration of lobbyists, prevention of corruption, and tax clearance for candidates for election. I acknowledge the work of the Opposition in these areas, which has served to develop debate on these matters. It will be clear from the content of the Bill before us and of the other legislative proposals to which I referred that the Government takes the maintenance of standards in public life very seriously. It is also clear that the issue is one which is complex and requires the achievement of a difficult balance between the rights and sensitivities of individuals working in the service of the public and the public interest in transparency and the maintenance of the highest standards.</P>
    <P>The genesis of the Standards in Public Office Bill lies in the Programme for Government &ndash; An Action Programme for the Millennium &ndash; and the work of the McCracken tribunal. In his report, Mr. Justice McCracken recognised the combined value of the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Acts and looked forward to these Acts being valuable mechanisms in guarding against the unacceptable elements of the financial transactions which the tribunal had uncovered. Among the key recommendations of the McCracken tribunal were the appointment of an independent third party to monitor and investigate possible contravention of the Ethics Act and that tax clearance systems, together with requirements for statutory declarations in relation to tax compliance, be put in place.</P>
    <P>In July 1998 the Government published outline proposals for a Standards in Public Office Bill in what subsequently became known as the &ldquo;Blue Book&rdquo;. The proposals were forwarded by resolutions of the Houses to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for consideration. The joint committee was directed in examining the proposals to consult with the Committees on Members' Interests of Dáil and Seanad Éireann, which oversee the Ethics Act in each House. The Standards in Public Office Bill takes into account the views expressed by these three Oireachtas committees. Moreover, when it was published, the Bill was referred back to the Oireachtas committees for their further consideration. That was a useful procedure, as the Committees on Members' Interests operates parts of the current legislation and has developed expertise in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the work the members of the <Col N="48" /> various committees have done on this Bill. I have taken very careful note of the views expressed by committee members who have considered the Bill. I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to address some of those concerns. The issues to be dealt with in the Standards in Public Office Bill are so important that they deserve to be closely considered by Members, by the appropriate committees and by the public in general.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main features of the Bill before us. The Standards in Public Office Bill provides for the establishment of a new Standards in Public Office Commission with wide investigative powers in relation to so-called specified acts. The latter are acts or omissions of public servants or officeholders which are inconsistent with the proper performance of the duties of the relevant position, or which would be inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in that performance. The commission will take and investigate complaints in this regard only where it considers the matter complained of to be of significant public importance. While it is a matter for the commission to make a judgment on what that means in any given case, the Bill provides that it may deem a matter to be of significant public importance if it relates to a benefit or potential benefit allegedly received by a person, where the value of the benefit exceeds £10,000. It will also be a function of the commission to receive complaints in relation to contravention of the Ethics Act or the Electoral Act, since it is to take on the current functions of the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the commission will be chaired by a judge or former judge of the Supreme or High Court and will have four other <i>ex officio</i> members, namely, the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman. The commission must be seen as being clearly independent of the political process. However, I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that a former Member of either House will be an ordinary member of the commission in addition to the four <i>ex officio</i> members. I agree with the view expressed by members of the Dáil Select Committee on Members' Interest that the commission would benefit by having available the perspective and expertise of a former politician. I do not believe this would undermine the independence of the commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the commission may engage inquiry officers to conduct preliminary investigations of complaints on its behalf. Inquiry officers may be drawn from the commission's staff or from outside the commission. An inquiry officer would report to the commission and indicate whether, in his or her opinion, a case existed for further investigation by the commission. This will give the commission a mechanism allowing it to ascertain whether a particular complaint might be frivolous or vexatious or might refer to a matter which is not of significant public importance. <Col N="49" /> In cases where a minor matter is the subject of complaint and which the commission does not believe justifies the full weight of an investigation by it, the complaint may be referred to a committee of the relevant House of the Oireachtas or to the Minister or public body concerned, as appropriate. This approach should meet any concerns that a standing commission might constitute an open invitation for endless investigations of minor matters.</P>
    <P>The commission will enjoy full tribunal powers, for example, in respect of such matters as summoning individuals and papers, administering oaths, ordering discovery and preservation of documents and requiring the giving of evidence. The Bill also provides that it will be an offence to obstruct an investigation of the commission or an inquiry officer. Consistent with Supreme Court rulings on tribunals, evidence given to the commission or an inquiry officer shall not be admissible as evidence against a person who is the subject of investigation in criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>It is important to make a distinction. While the commission will be in a position to accept complaints about office holders and a wide range of public servants, similar complaints about ordinary Oireachtas Members will be made via the clerk to the relevant Oireachtas committee, as happens under the Ethics in Public Office Act. However, if it so decides, a committee will be in a position to enlist the commission to investigate an issue and report back to the House concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the definition of &ldquo;connected person&rdquo; for the purposes of the wider investigative remit of the commission will be the same as that in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. A connected person for the purposes of the Act includes a relative, business partner, company in which the person has a controlling interest, or person with whom the person enjoys a trustee-beneficiary relationship. I am satisfied this definition, which is comprehended by the terms of reference of current tribunals, taken with the proposed mandate and powers of the commission, constitutes a sound basis for commission investigations. This should ensure the commission is not hampered in carrying out its functions.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the development by the Government, the commission or the Minister for Finance of codes of conduct which will apply to Ministers and other office holders, Members of the Oireachtas and employees of public bodies respectively. These codes of conduct will deal with the standards of conduct and integrity appropriate to the persons to whom they relate in the performance of their public duties. The codes will form part of the terms and conditions of public service employees and will provide guidance for them in the performance of their functions. Such codes shall be admissible in proceedings before a court, tribunal, Oireachtas committee or the commission which may take account of the terms of such codes in making determinations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> The Bill proposes that the codes of conduct for Members of the Oireachtas would be drawn up by the new Standards in Public Office Commission. This approach flowed directly from a recommendation of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service in its 1999 report on the Government's original proposals for a Standards in Public Office Bill. However, not all Deputies who have studied the Bill have been happy with this approach, and I will propose an amendment to the Bill to provide that, instead of being drawn up by the commission, the codes of conduct for Members of the Oireachtas will be drawn up by select committees. These would be applied subsequently to Members by resolutions passed in each House. The commission would be consulted.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Deputies will be aware that the Dáil Select Committee on Members' Interests has considered a draft code of conduct for Members of this House on foot of a resolution passed on 7 March 2001 and has recently published a substantial and thoughtful report on this matter with associated recommendations. The committee's report has implications for the Standards in Public Office Bill and I am examining it carefully. Where amendments are required, these will be introduced on Committee Stage. Work has also started on a code of conduct for civil servants. A draft code has been laid before the Houses and is being considered by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Consultations with unions are ongoing.</P>
    <P>The committees which reported on the Government's original blue book proposals did not support the creation of offences for breaches of the legislation. While acknowledging the committees' views, the Government is concerned to ensure that the regime to be put in place should command public confidence. The Bill accordingly provides that where the commission finds evidence of wrongdoing on the part of a person who is the subject of an investigation, the organisation or public body to whom a person is answerable will receive the commission's report so that it will be in a position to consider appropriate disciplinary action. In respect of a Deputy or Senator, this would involve the laying of a report before the relevant House and that House would then decide on what penalty might be applied. In the case of a civil servant, receipt by his or her employing Department of an adverse commission report could trigger disciplinary procedures against the official. The commission and the relevant committees may also, in certain circumstances, make a report to the DPP.</P>
    <P>The Bill also requires that Members of the Houses must furnish a tax clearance certificate in respect of themselves or a partnership in which they are a member within nine months either side of an election. A statutory declaration that the Member's tax affairs are in order would have to be made one month either side of the election. Consistent with the thrust of Oireachtas committee views, the Bill also provides for tax clearance <Col N="51" /> and declarations for persons appointed to positions as senior public officials and as judges, and they would also have to make similar statutory declarations. The commission is empowered to investigate breaches of the tax clearance requirements. The Bill increases the penalties for making a false declaration under the Statutory Declarations Act from a fine of £50 to one of £2,000 and a term of imprisonment from three to six months. This tax compliance declaration cannot be treated lightly.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for a level of streamlining of the current requirements for declarations of interests and donations under the Electoral Act, 1997, and the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. The dates for the making of statements under both Acts will be brought into line and the overlap in reporting requirements which require certain amounts to be declared both as political donations under the Act of 1997 and as gifts under the Act of 1995 will be removed. I know that some members of committees who examined the Bill are of the view that the Bill should go further in this respect and I intend to introduce further streamlining measures on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have set out for the House the main features of the Bill. It will lead to the introduction of powerful investigation mechanisms for serious complaints about persons serving the public, with whistleblower protections for persons making such complaints, tax compliance requirements for Members of the Oireachtas, judges and senior public servants, codes of conduct for public servants, office holders and Oireachtas Members, and clearer, more streamlined reporting rules under the ethics and electoral Acts. In addition to these, there are various technical amendments of the Ethics in Public Office Act, and Members will see from the explanatory memorandum that much of the Bill consists of such amendments. I look forward to further consideration of these on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In framing the Bill, the Government sought to listen to the views of members of all parties and was mindful of the need to achieve a balance between the right to privacy and the exigencies of the common good. The Bill acknowledges the independence of each House in regulating its own affairs and it can only be applied to the Houses of the Oireachtas by resolution in each House. The Bill is not the Government's last word on the maintenance of standards in public office &ndash; I set out some of the other initiatives under way in this regard. I will be interested to hear the views of Deputies from all sides of the House on the Bill. I assure them that I will give careful consideration to their views because each Member has a valuable contribution to make to the successful development and implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for a Bill of this nature is unanswerable as the roll-out of evidence at the tribunals continues to raise the gravest concerns. Although it has been clearly established in only seven cases that Members or former Members of the Oireachtas were involved in tax evasion, the acceptance of large gifts of money and the holding of overseas accounts, it is seven too many. It remains to be seen if any other Oireachtas Members are added to the roll of dishonour, but as far as the public is concerned, we are all involved. As a consequence of this perception, the Oireachtas enacted the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the Electoral Act, 1997, both of which are significantly amended by the Bill.</P>
      <P>Today the Minister of State and yesterday the Taoiseach recited the long list of Bills which are at various stages of progress through the House. It appears that enormous legal encumbrances will be placed on Members who have no legal advice, provision for legal costs or administrative help to meet the onerous requirements now being imposed on them.</P>
      <P>I speak with some experience. I was recently the subject of a complaint under the Electoral Act, 1997, which I had to go to great trouble to answer. I do not have a filing clerk to check my files or money to hire legal advice. I was able to answer the complaint, but at considerable inconvenience to myself. I use this example to illustrate the effect on Members of the two existing Acts, the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the Electoral Act, 1997. My first criticism of the Bill and of the raft of other legislation is that they deal only with the responsibilities of Members but not with their rights.</P>
      <P>In the policy document, The Democratic Revolution, I spell out how the Oireachtas should be reformed, not only in a radical way but in a revolutionary way. Today we are once again addressing empty seats. What does this say about standards in public life? We are going through a process but we are not doing our job properly because we are not resourced to do so. We are not resourced to answer the inevitable questions which will arise under the huge raft of legislation which is promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We already have the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, the Electoral Act, 1997, as amended, and today's Standards in Public Office Bill. The Taoiseach has promised that several other Bills will be enacted before the end of this year and I welcome that. He has spoken of a Bill to deal with the audit of party leaders' allowances. I will speak about that Bill later because I believe it does not go far enough. He has also spoken about another electoral Bill, a disclosure of donations and expenditure Bill, a lobbying Bill and a whistleblowers protection Bill. The Taoiseach has promised ten Bills and I regret to say that all of them appear to be necessary. When they are all enacted I would like to see consolidating legislation to simplify and co-ordinate these complex matters as far as possible. Within this raft of legis<Col N="53" /> lation I see the makings of major and undue embarrassment in the future because of the complexity and cross purposes of some of these Bills and because of the lack of resources for Members to keep the necessary records and answer the necessary questions when they arise.</P>
    <P>We speak about vexatious and frivolous complaints but we do not speak about unfounded political charges. I have also experienced this in recent weeks. We do not speak of questions which are laden with innuendo and inference which are unjustified and without basis. The Minister of State himself participated in this by writing an article in <i>The Irish Examiner.</i> That amounts to low standards in public life.</P>

      <P>It should be an offence for a Member of either House to try to bring the name of another Member into disrepute without basis or without using the complaints mechanisms which are available and a penalty should be attached to that offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We can provide in the code of conduct for Members that making malicious and political charges with no basis should be an offence. If such things are said in the House they can be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and dealt with by the Ceann Comhairle. However, if they are said outside the House by way of statement to the press or otherwise, there is no remedy. Such behaviour will bring politics into disrepute as much as the issues which, properly, are sought to be addressed by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, so far as it goes, but it will require significant amendment. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has indicated his willingness to listen to amendments and his intention to introduce amendments of his own. The Minister of State is one of those who generally uphold high standards in politics although I was disappointed to see him trapped by his own press office into writing scurrilous articles which have no basis in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision must be made for Members who receive a salary equivalent to that of an assistant principal officer, to have legal advice available to them. I have had to engage legal advice to deal with questions from the commission arising from the complaint against me. No resources are provided for me do to this. I do not have a person to maintain my files or to search for records. Like every Member of the House I have one secretary. A huge burden is being placed on Members by this and other Bills. Resources must be provided for this and for other parliamentary reforms which I have spelt out in The Democratic Revolution. Legal costs and advice and proper staff must be made available to Members. We should <Col N="54" /> make no apology for this. This is the most under-staffed parliament in Europe. In the United Kingdom the Assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have better staffing arrangements than we do. If we do not address this issue we will find ourselves, individually and as a body politic, in a huge quagmire.</P>
    <P>Does a complainant enjoy privilege for his complaint? Will a complaint which is subsequently overturned or found to have no basis in fact be covered by the rule of privilege? How will such a complaint be distinguished from the privilege which is rightly afforded to legitimate and well founded complaints? The question of the privilege which applies to complaints and to documents relating to them must be clarified. Should there be penalties for malicious complaints or for the use of documents of a malicious nature which are found to have no basis? </P>
    <P>The Bill should set out the procedure for the proper making of complaints and the penalties for complainants who breach this procedure, especially by way of public charge instead of using the complaints procedure. This will be a very important protection for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the future. We must protect ourselves against malicious and political charges. We must provide a fair and independent means of having procedures processed so that they are not made the subject of newspaper articles for several weeks before a complaint is made, or no complaint is made. I speak from personal experience in this matter. No right of appeal is set out anywhere in the Bill, yet such a right is one of the four fundamental requirements of natural justice.</P>
    <P>As regards setting out a procedure, when the complaint was made by Deputy Fleming against me concerning this famous opinion poll, at least he did it properly. However, under the Electoral Act no procedure is set out for that. Therefore, the commission was making it up as it went along because it did not have any set procedure to deal with the complaint. Nor, as the person against whom the complaint was made, did I have the advantage of knowing what the procedure would be. This is a major gap in the legislation which should spell out what the complaints procedure will be and what the right of appeal procedure will be. That should be contained in the Bill by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>There should be penalties for frivolous or vexatious complaints or political charges. Under the terms of the Bill the commission can decide that a complaint is vexatious or frivolous but no penalties are provided for such charges, although they should be. There is no reference at all to charges of a purely political nature which occur in the heat of the moment and in the cut and thrust of politics, although there should be. These issues should be addressed as a safeguard to all of us who are taking on enormous responsibilities and encumbrances under this legislation, although it affords us no protection or rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill should also provide that relatively <Col N="55" /> minor offences should be dealt with by a committee of the House, perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. We have had the case of the Labour Party which was alleged to have overspent by the sum of £257 in the Dublin South Central by-election. The matter was referred to the Dirctor of Public Prosecutions but it was a totally absurd waste of the DPP's time. If it was an offence, which it turned out not to be, it was a minor matter which should never have been referred to the DPP. We are criminalising ourselves even for minor technical breaches, the remedies for which are already provided for in the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Act. If the commission finds there has been such a breach, it has no choice but to refer it to the DPP and as a result one is treated as a criminal. In the case of the Dublin South Central by-election, however, the DPP decided that the matter did not warrant prosecution. That led to a contretemps between the commission and the Department of the Environment and Local Government which refused to amend the legislation. That, in turn, led to a new diktat from the commission as to what it would treat as expenditure in future. The Minister should make provision so that where the commission finds there was a breach, but of a minor or technical nature, there should be some way of dealing with it other than referring it to the DPP. Only serious matters should be referred to the DPP.</P>
    <P>When this corpus of legislation has been enacted we should attempt to have a consolidated Act covering the whole panoply of provisions relating to standards in public office and the prevention of corruption. Otherwise, in future there will be a labyrinthine web of measures that is bound to trip up many decent and upright Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that the Bill will alter the current commission by removing the Ceann Comhairle and replacing him with a judge who in this case would be the chairman. As the Bill extends itself to include certain declarations relating to judges, a judge acting as chairman may be the best option. As spelt out in our party's document, The Democratic Revolution, the Ceann Comhairle should be the harbinger and upholder of standards in parliamentary public life. I regret to say that this duty is not spelt out anywhere in the Bill, nor has it always been adopted by successive Cinn Comhairle. Normally, in any other parliament, the Speaker's first duty is to uphold the rights and standards of parliament across a wide range of headings, yet the Ceann Comhairle is being excluded from these provisions, which is an adverse development. The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is not included either.</P>
    <P>We have a judge, the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Clerk of the Seanad and the Clerk of the Dáil. I have been privileged to work closely with two holders of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in my previous capacity as Chairman of the Com<Col N="56" /> mittee of Public Accounts. The Comptroller and Auditor General works closely with Members of the Oireachtas on whom, under this legislation, he may be called to make a judgment. The same is true of the Clerks of the Seanad and Dáil. Would it not be better, and provide a clear distance, if we were to seek to find some other office holders who might constitute the commission? There is a proximity in the proposed make-up of the commission which could make life awkward from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle should be the head of this establishment with clear duties spelt out in legislation. It is my hope that when the promised Oireachtas commission is established by law, which we are told will happen before the end of the year, the Bill will clearly spell out the rights and duties of the Ceann Comhairle, especially with respect to upholding standards within the Oireachtas. It should also be a duty of the Ceann Comhairle to ensure the standard, completeness and honesty of replies provided to the House, the absence of which in the past has led to the establishment of tribunals. That area of standards in public life is not provided for in the Bill, however.</P>
    <P>The Bill co-ordinates the date of declarations made under the Electoral Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act. In other words, declarations have to be made by the same date but why should we be making two declarations? Should the Bill not go further and conflate both declarations into one, thus providing a composite declaration? The Minister should consider that point so that instead of having two declarations there would be just one covering all the issues required to be declared by the relevant Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no reference to reporting standards as regards complaints, which is another matter of considerable importance. If a person is charged before the courts, there is certain protection as to the standards of reporting but if a person is charged before the commission there are no rules concerning how those complaints are to be reported, whether there is a rush to judgment, distortion of the complaint or a summary of the complaint that does not represent the full facts. All these matters can unfairly destroy reputations, yet no consideration is given to this matter in the Bill. The Minister should consider whether reporting standards in the courts can be important regarding the reporting standards for complaints, especially where the complaints are serious and where serious damage could be done to a Member's reputation. I am not concerned where damage is done to the reputation of a Member where his or her actions or omissions warrant it; I am talking about a situation where they do not warrant it and where the complaint is not upheld.</P>
    <P>I will propose an amendment to the draft code of the Committee on Members' Interest of Dáil Éireann that it should be a breach of the code of conduct of both Houses for a complaint or a charge to be made except to the committee. If the declaration of a Member is to be questioned by <Col N="57" /> another Member, it should done by procedure through a committee where these matters can be fairly adjudicated upon and not in the media in the first instance. I say this from personal experience in recent weeks. I happen to be the fall guy in this respect. However, my reputation will stand up to any scrutiny but I am concerned to protect Members of both Houses now and in the future against unfair attacks.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann should be chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, even though I have the height of respect for the current chairman, Deputy Killeen, because the Ceann Comhairle has an overriding responsibility to protect the reputation of this House in terms of the standards of Members or those of the House as a body corporate. The role of the committee should be widened beyond its current remit.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the definition of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; including business partners, with which I agree, but should tax clearance not be provided by a company of which a Member is a director? Where does tax clearance stop? If a candidate or a Member is a director of several companies which are evading taxes and have not settled their affairs with the Revenue Commissioners, why should a partner in a business be at a complete disadvantage compared to a director of a wayward firm? The definition of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo;, given the social norm of the day, should be amended to included a life partner. The reality of life today is that more and more people have life partners who are the equivalent of married spouses.</P>
    <P>The future role of the Committee of Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann is not clear from the legislation. The committee should be chaired by the Ceann Comhairle or in the case of the Seanad Members' interests committee, the Cathaoirleach</P>
    <P>There is no provision for confidentiality in the complaints process where this is required in the interest of natural justice. These issues will be very sensitive in the future. The complaints procedure should be detailed in the legislation because there is no provision in the Electoral Acts for what the complaints procedure should be and I fear there will be a serious challenge in the courts. No proper complaints procedure is provided in law for the Public Offices Commission. It is open to serious challenge and a proper procedure needs to be spelt out in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that judges should have tax compliance certificates within nine months of appointment. What happens if they do not? That is not outlined in the legislation. It is an offence but there is no penalty and the Bill is deficient in that regard. What happens if the Revenue Commissioners refuse to issue a tax clearance certificate within nine months or the appeals procedure has been exhausted and a certificate has not been granted? Public opinion can be brought to bear on a Member in such circumstances but it has no impact on the Judiciary. That is a major <Col N="58" /> deficiency in the legislation and it should spell out what the penalty will be for judges and Members who are not tax compliant within the specified period.</P>
    <P>Should there be a requirement on judges to make annual declarations of interest under the legislation in the same way as Members must take two declarations of interest? Why must members of the Judiciary only make a declaration on tax compliance? Members of the Judiciary have an even more influential role in many respects than Members of the Oireachtas. Should there be an annual audit of declarations? In other words, should we go a little further than just accepting the declarations of Members? Should someone such as the Comptroller and Auditor-General take a sample of Members' declarations each year and examine them in greater detail as a means to ensure they are complete and accurate? Currently we depend utterly on the honour of the Member to make a complete and honest declaration. The question of carrying out an audit should be examined. Everybody would not be audited annually but a sample could be taken.</P>
    <P>Should one complainant, however vexatious, be sufficient to make a complaint or should a minimum number of people, say two, five or ten, be required to do so? As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts I receive various vexatious complaints daily. Even a polite letter of acknowledgement to some generated a raft of further correspondence. It must be considered whether a complaint by one person is enough or whether, in particular, it is sufficient that one Member of the House makes a complaint against another Member or whether a minimum number should be required.</P>
    <P>The rights of Deputies between the day the House is dissolved and the day of the general election is being considered but is not covered in the Bill. The legislation should make it clear that Deputies, similar to Senators, can continue to avail of their offices during that period, otherwise there would be massive disruption as most of us have our secretaries here. The Public Offices Commission has mentioned that it is discussing and pursuing this issue. That right should be provided for in law, as it is in the case of Senators.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the proposal that where there is insufficient evidence to uphold a complaint the commission may make a finding that it is not upheld or not proven as this may leave a Member in limbo. The commission can say there is insufficient evidence to uphold the complaint without saying it is vexatious or rejecting the complaint. The issue needs to be teased out.</P>
    <P>The documents submitted under compellability to the commission, as in the case of tribunals, should be exempted from the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, unless they are published as part of the findings. This legislation, apart from the obvious needs of the Oireachtas, demands that we address the question of resources for individual Members and for Members collectively. These resources will have to be provided together <Col N="59" /> with legal advice and costs for Members if they are not to be the victims of the legislation when it is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, and indeed Deputy Mitchell, have concentrated in their contributions on many of the details of the Bill and it is right that they should do so. I intend to do something similar later in my contribution but it behoves us to examine the context in which this debate is situated and to examine some of the facts which have brought us to where we are now. We can usefully start with a reality check on the standing of politics and politicians at what is the start of the 21st century and no matter how one comes at this, the conclusion is a stark and indisputable one. Politics and politicians are held in contempt by a significant percentage of our population and many of the rest are cynical, at best. Huge numbers of people also believe that we are irrelevant. Many of our citizens have lost faith in the capacity or the willingness of politics and politicians to make changes for the better and, as we all know, it is becoming increasingly difficult to encourage people into public life.</P>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge that there are many reasons this has happened, and some of those reasons have little or nothing to do with politicians, either specifically as individuals or politicians generally. We should acknowledge, for example, the role that has been played by increased prosperity, which has led to a widespread disengagement from politics. People get their satisfaction elsewhere. They believe their lives can be bettered through activities other than politics and they are more than willing to believe that politicians have little role in the general improvement of life that has taken place over recent years and indeed decades.</P>
      <P>The perceived convergence of politics towards the centre has appeared to offer less choice to people and, therefore, they are less engaged. Everything was simple once upon a time when we talked about nationalisation, market economies or what seemed like, and which in many cases were, polar opposites. It is not so simple now. The choices are just as important but they are not as stark as they once appeared to be.</P>
      <P>It is important that we acknowledge the role that the dumbing down of the media has played in the disrespect, even contempt, for politics. Some elements of the media effectively trade on cultivating contempt for politics and politicians and playing down the role politics and politicians play in our national life. They seem to think, and they may well be right, that it is a good way to sell newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these factors have played a role but we have to acknowledge too that the biggest single factor in bringing us to where we are now, in terms of the view the public holds of us and of this House, is the corruption and impropriety committed by some present and past Members of the House, which is being highlighted on a daily <Col N="60" /> basis in Dublin Castle. What is happening in Dublin Castle will ultimately be to the good of politics. We need to set out, warts and all, what has been done in our name and the way in which our democracy has been used and abused by certain individuals to line their own pockets. We need to go through the process to do our best to ensure that it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>I want to begin my contribution by stating what all of us in this House know and believe. Most politicians came into politics to serve the public and that is what the vast majority of us do day in, day out. The vast majority of politicians have not entertained a corrupt thought and many of us have lost money and careers by virtue of our participation in public life. We do not, and should not, look for plaudits for that but we are entitled to expect people to accept our bona fides. This is true of the great majority in all parties. I reject, as does my party, the notion that politicians are all the same. They are not and we are not. Most public representatives, on a personal basis, have nothing to be ashamed of and every reason to be angry at the small minority who have dragged our collective reputation into the gutter.</P>
    <P>That is not to suggest that I, or anyone else in the Labour Party, believe that we are all in this together. We reject emphatically the notion that there are just a few bad apples spread over all parties. No member of my party, from the lowliest branch member to the leadership, has been implicated in any way by the work of the tribunals or in any other way. Indeed, the opposite is true. Labour Party councillors in Dublin fought tooth and nail to prevent many of the rezonings which we now know to have been dubious, to say the least. While councillors from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael cashed their cheques, many of my colleagues sought to highlight the abuse which was going on and which everyone knew was going on. I do not intend, in this contribution or elsewhere, to undervalue the work and commitment of those Labour Party councillors by accepting the suggestion of common venality, which we so often hear these days. Everyone knew or suspected what was going on but only Labour, of the major parties, opposed it.</P>
    <P>It is all too convenient for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Members to wring their hands and suggest that corruption is or was an individual sin of people who just happened to be members of their respective parties. Certainly it was that, but it was also much more. It arose out of the culture and ethos which was, and to some extent still is, pervasive in those parties, in particular in Fianna Fáil. It also arose out of the uncomfortable and improper interaction of politics and business, a problem that survives to this day.</P>
    <P>It is an established fact that Charles J. Haughey received millions of pounds in personal donations when he was leader of Fianna Fáil. It is an established fact that two members of his 1989 Cabinet received hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations in 1989 alone and those donations are now the subject of investigations by the tribunals. <Col N="61" /> It is also a fact that three Members of this House who were elected as Fianna Fáil TDs now sit as Independent Members, having lost the Whip in one circumstance or other. Another, the former Deputy Ray Burke, who made tens of thousands of pounds in a few weeks in 1989 alone, was Minister for Foreign Affairs just a few years ago. It is a fact that dozens of Fianna Fáil councillors have questions to answer in relation to the money received. This did not just happen, it was allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Cute hoorism is endemic in Ireland and it is also endemic in Fianna Fáil, but what happened in Fianna Fáil under Charles J. Haughey was more than cute hoorism, it was corruption, straight and fair. It is true &ndash; I want to be clear about this &ndash; that only a small minority benefited directly but those who put that man into office and sustained him there through thick and thin knew what they were dealing with. They knew that Charlie did not play by the book unless he wrote the book. Some in Fianna Fáil opposed it. I acknowledge the role of the Minister of State in that regard who was, for most of that time, not in Fianna Fáil and also his senior Minister, but they did not succeed in preventing Charles J. Haughey from corrupting not only his own party but Irish politics generally.</P>
    <P>The state of Fianna Fáil in the 1980s owes much to the personality of Charles J. Haughey, the people who appointed him and surrounded him and those who allowed him to do what he did, but it is also indicative of a much wider problem. I refer to the unhealthy interaction between business and politics. That works at two different levels. It operates on the level of individual politicians, most likely Ministers &ndash; Deputy Lowry is an obvious case in point. Any politician who accepts money or favours from a businessman on whom he may be in a position to confer some benefit puts himself at risk. I will say no more on that matter as it is currently before the Moriarty tribunal and the parties concerned must be allowed to have their say.</P>
    <P>We can and must deal with the bigger question, however, namely, the interaction of business with political parties as opposed to individuals. In principle there is nothing wrong with business making donations to political parties but in practice it has not worked out that way. Political parties throughout Europe, primarily of the right but including some of the left, have been in the pocket of big business for decades and it has become clear in recent years that that relationship has been far from proper &ndash; Tangentopoli in Italy, the CDU under Helmut Kohl, Paris under the RPR, the Socialists in Spain, the list is very long.</P>
    <P>The conclusion is unavoidable. Politics and political parties must be kept at arms length from each other. The experience of corruption and undue influence in the past and the suspicion in the present is too strong. It is time to wholeheartedly accept the recommendations of Judge McCracken just a few years ago that anything <Col N="62" /> which might put an individual or a political party in a position of compromise should be prohibited. In this as in so many other things, perception is as important as reality.</P>
    <P>I make those introductory points so as to make two central points about the Bill. First, the Bill, as Deputy Mitchell said, does not go far enough. It makes no effort, for example, to separate business and politics but, second, and on a different note, some of its provisions are or could be intrusive into the private affairs of individual public representatives. In an ideal world this would not or should not be necessary but, unfortunately, it is precisely the experience of the past 20 years which makes it not just necessary but urgent.</P>
    <P>In his contribution, the Minister set out the detailed process of consultation we have gone through in preparing the Bill as drafted. I was party to some of that process as a member of the sub-committee of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service which examined this issue. There are quite a few questions for Committee Stage, and there is cross-party agreement and disagreement on some of these issues. However, I do not wish to turn these issues into party political matters.</P>
    <P>The basis of this Bill is to strike a balance between what the Minister refers to as legitimate public interest and prying or intruding into the private affairs of individuals or, perhaps of more relevance, people connected with those individuals who are involved in public life. There is also a balance to be struck in terms of answerability. All Members are answerable to the law. We are citizens and have to uphold and adhere to the law as citizens of this republic. If we do not do so we can rightly be brought by the DPP, the Garda or whoever before the courts to which we are answerable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps of more relevance to this debate, is the fact that Members are also directly accountable to their electorates. People put us here to do a job. They are entitled to know on what basis we make our decisions and to pass judgment on that decision-making process. That is the essence of democracy and we should uphold that principle above all others. Any legislation, such as the Bill before the House, has to be put in the general context that, ultimately, the people have their say and, ultimately, they hire and fire us.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of our responsibility before the law and our responsibility to the people that we then have to carefully define the nature of our additional responsibility to the House and what rules the House should seek to dictate to Members of the Oireachtas. It is proper that the House has a role in determining what we may or may not do. It also has a role in upholding, and insisting that Members uphold, the dignity and propriety of politics and the institutions of this State.</P>
    <P>A question arises regarding sanctions. The punters, if I can use that word, are entitled to elect whoever they wish. People are entitled to elect a mass-murderer or a paedophile to this House, so <Col N="63" /> long as they know about it when they elect that person. If they so wish, people are entitled to elect a dog with two tails to this House. That is a fundamental principle.</P>
    <P>However, the converse is also true. Expulsion from this House, or removing a seat from a Member, is a sanction which should be available only in the most extreme circumstances and, arguably, should not be available at all, except where it becomes clear that a Member was elected as one thing and he or she proves to be something entirely different. If, for example, a Member is convicted of murder during the course of his or her tenure in this House, a fact which was not known to people before the Member was elected, there is a case that the seat should be forfeited in those circumstances. However, the circumstances in which the ultimate sanction of removing a Member's seat or expelling a Member from the House can be used should be carefully defined and such a course of action should take place only in the most extreme circumstances.</P>
    <P>There was some debate among the various committees which considered the Bill about whether it should be open to impose monetary penalties on Members who were guilty of various offences. Forfeiting pay is a sanction which should be available to the commission. Others take a different view and there is a legal opinion that imposing something which looks like a fine may be beyond the scope of this House, or a committee of the House. It is worth legally testing this concept as we hold ourselves up to ridicule if, effectively, we allow a Member to absent himself or herself from the House and its committees for a month, or up to three months, without any meaningful sanction.</P>
    <P>Allowing a Member to look after his or her constituency work with the full sanction of the House and calling that a punishment is not something which the public could be expected to take seriously as a sanction. We should go further and give the commission power to allow Members to be suspended without pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell rightly dealt at some length with the issue of frivolous and vexatious complaints and the mechanism for making and dealing with complaints. The Deputy is correct to suggest that we need to set out the relevant procedure. He is also correct to point out that, under the Ethics in Public Office Act, the procedure is less than clear. I do not intend to go into the details of the complaint made against Deputy Mitchell under the electoral Act, but it is fair to say that we have not had a flood of vexatious or frivolous complaints under the Acts in the few years in which they have been in operation. That is a tribute to other Members who have taken their responsibilities under the Acts seriously and have been slow to use the Acts to gain political advantage. This gives us reason to be optimistic about the future.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that there is concern about the powers the commission will have. It <Col N="64" /> could be flooded with complaints which are intended to gain political advantage or even to embarrass individual people. Such complaints need not originate in this House as they can come from members of the public. Members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or the Committee on Members' Interests, I am not sure which, who visited Australia were concerned that its standing commission appears to spend a great deal of time examining what frequently prove to be frivolous or vexatious complaints. We need a mechanism to avoid such a scenario.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the principle mechanism in the Bill is the power being given to the commission to ask an inquiry officer to examine complaints in the first instance. That is fair enough. If I read the Bill correctly, it seems to give the commission discretion as to whether an inquiry officer carries out such an examination first. It might be preferable if it is compulsory that some sort of investigation of complaints is made before the commission carries out a full investigation. However, there is a need for a clearing mechanism to ensure we do not give rise to frivolous complaints or that people cannot act on spite or malice by the use of this mechanism.</P>
    <P>An obvious question which arises is whether anonymous complaints should be entertained. The disposition of all of us would be to say no. It is possible that people who come across information in the course of their duties as a public servants or whatever will make a complaint but will not wish to identify themselves. On that basis I would be reluctant to suggest that we should always exclude the investigation of anonymous complaints. However, in cases where the complainant is not identified, there should be an onus on the commission to satisfy itself that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case to sustain the complaint, over and above the frivolous and vexatious requirement in the Bill. Anonymous complaints should be entertained only in extreme circumstances and complainants should have to cross a higher hurdle to start the process.</P>
    <P>A major provision of the Bill deals with the requirement for tax clearance. One of the major powers given to us as legislators is the power to impose, and require the payment of, taxes. In those circumstances it would be invidious, to say to least, if Members of this House who impose taxes do not live up to their obligations under the laws which they pass. Regrettably, there have been examples in the recent past where this has occurred.</P>
    <P>The House has also taken it upon itself to impose an obligation on various traders seeking supports or grants from the State, or seeking licences from the courts, to provide tax clearance certificates. This process will continue and will probably be enhanced and expanded in the future. I support the principle that we should require Members to provide tax clearance certificates.</P>
    <P>The Minister will know that there are questions over the workability of this system and what hap<Col N="65" /> pens if a person is in legitimate dispute with the Revenue Commissioners concerning an alleged tax liability. It could take some time for a tax clearance certificate to issue. Even if it takes less than the nine months allowed under the Bill, it is possible that malicious or other kinds of rumours will circulate about the non-provision of the tax clearance certificate. The Revenue Commissioners have genuine problems with these provisions. We need to work out a mechanism with them which will be fair to all parties concerned and will ensure that people who have genuine complaints or disputes with the Revenue Commissioners do not fall foul of this provision. However, I support the principle that Members of this House, who impose the taxes, should pay their taxes in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also dealt with the issue of connected persons. This is not an easy issue. It is one thing to say we should impose duties on ourselves, for example, a duty to be answerable to the public and to make certain declarations about our interests outside the House. Few people who enter public life can complain about that. We would also accept the principle that Ministers, who wield power on our behalf, have particular responsibilities in this regard. The definition of connected persons, therefore, should be broader when applied to Ministers. The compromise the Minister proposes in the Bill is probably fair; the definition in the Ethics in Public Office Act is one we can run with. Deputy Mitchell's point about lifelong partners is reasonable and should be taken on board, although I am not persuaded about company directors.</P>
    <P>Much of what we are dealing with in the Bill has been debated in the Committee on Members' Interests and is dealt with in its report which issued a few weeks ago. That report sets out some interesting questions which we can deal with on Committee Stage. It deals with, for example, the issue of legitimate protest. The code of conduct for Members seeks to outlaw or discourage activities which bring the business of politics and the institutions of the State into disrepute. It also imposes an obligation on Members to uphold the law. This sounds very easy but there are laws with which Members disagree and, on occasion, we have protested and sought to have them changed.</P>
    <P>The debate in the Committee on Members' Interests considered protests against GMOs in County Wexford, the incinerator in Galway and various other protests. I and members of my party have been involved in public protests seeking to have certain laws changed. The obligation to uphold the law cannot extend to prohibiting such reasonable democratic activity. While I agree that we have a duty to uphold the law, we must also ensure that our rights as politicians and as citizens to legitimate public protest are safeguarded under any code that might be agreed.</P>
    <P>Much of the focus of this debate has been on the rights and duties of Deputies and Senators. That is understandable but we should not lose <Col N="66" /> sight of the fact that the Bill also deals with senior civil servants. I am not sure we have done as much as we might have to allow senior civil servants to have their views expressed and understood in public. The finance and general affairs committee is considering a code of conduct for civil servants. There have been preliminary discussions so far with representatives of trade unions who represent the civil servants concerned. It is important to encourage civil servants to express their views and to have a real input into the debate. There is something slightly invidious or uncomfortable about the debate focusing exclusively on politicians. I hope the other parties affected by this legislation will have the input they deserve and to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>There was also some debate about whether Members should be held accountable for past activities which would bring the body politic or the institutions of the State into disrepute. While some believe the past activities of some Members have done that, on balance I concur with the conclusion of the committee that what is past is past and should remain there. Accountability, at least under this legislation, should only start from the day people become Members of the Houses.</P>
    <P>The basic principle of the Bill is to deal with acts which are inconsistent with the proper performance of the duties of the relevant position, that is, the position held by the person who is allegedly in contravention of those duties, or which would be inconsistent with the maintenance of public confidence in that performance. We might have to look at that more carefully because it is focused on the rights of an individual in terms of the post held by that individual rather than the duty of all Members to uphold the good standing of politics and the House. It might be necessary to define that basic concept in a broader way.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. It is only one part of the programme of legislation which will have to be put in place before the end of this year but it is a reasonable start and I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. All Members who contribute to a debate such as this are conscious that any suggestions they might make could be interpreted as their not being in support of putting this legislation to work and giving parliamentarians a framework as to how they should work and behave in the House and in carrying out their duties as public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of legislation already in place and the legislation that is promised or being considered in this area by various committees and the Government is extensive. This Parliament is probably to the fore, in the context of parliaments throughout the world, in the amount of such legislation under consideration. I agree that, in principle, there is a need for a framework or system of sanctions to be put in place, given that a minority of people who held public office, be they <Col N="67" /> public representatives or officials, have behaved badly in the past. Hence the tribunals of inquiry. However, we must weigh against that the need to debate in full the Bill before the House today, the legislation that preceded it and proposed legislation in this regard. We need to weigh how sensible it is. We need to understand what is required or desired by the electorate and what we require to make our work more transparent and better policed.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, as has been the case with previous legislation, we have been in a rush to be cleaner than clean and to move from where we are to where we want to be without due consideration. As a result, we have almost put ourselves in a straitjacket. That can be seen with the legislation controlling the amount of money spent in elections and the legislation governing our disclosure of interests. It is now obvious that some of the constraints in that legislation are extremely tight and almost unworkable. It is difficult for Members of the Houses to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of that when considering this Bill. I am also conscious of the example offered in today's debate of an overspend of £250. The administrative costs involved in chasing this would make a nonsense of the legislation passed in the House. There is a rush from various quarters to complain about Members of the Oireachtas although some of the complaints are vexatious, spurious and of a very minor nature. We must be extremely cautious about how we approach these matters.</P>
    <P>The public demands greater accountability and transparency in terms of how elected representatives conduct their business and it is perfectly entitled to do so. As a Member of the House, I want to see such transparency and accountability put into practice. Like the majority of Members, I want to conduct my business in an open fashion in compliance with all our existing legislative regulations. However, I want to do so in the knowledge that we are not far exceeding our brief or tying our hands. The majority involved in local and national politics are decent, honest men and women who make a significant contribution to democracy, largely at their own cost. Members of families within the House and throughout local government have given many years' credible service to the country. We are dealing with a small number, some of whom have already been exposed, who have crossed the line and set out for personal gain.</P>
    <P>We must draw up guidelines and a code of ethics for Members' conduct and provide disciplinary procedures for anyone who crosses the line. However, we must avoid blindly rushing into something we will regret at a later date. We must not lose sight of the fact that this debate is not just about politicians and members of local and national government. It is also about civil servants. There is an argument that politicians at local and national level have no power because they are overridden by one rule or another and <Col N="68" /> the Government merely trundles on with the help of civil servants. I acknowledge that the majority of civil servants are honest, hardworking people who do their bit for democracy although a small minority may exceed their remit. Everyone who serves the democratic process must be accountable.</P>
    <P>The commission's structure was referred to, as was the nature of the complaints made and the manner in which they will be processed. I want to give an example of the spin which can be put on matters which go wrong. The planning process in local authorities throughout the country was examined with a view to identifying corruption. The examination resulted in a huge number of vexatious and spurious complaints which cast huge doubts on the planning process. The impression was conveyed that the entire process and the officials and politicians involved in it were corrupt although that is completely untrue. Many honest, decent people were tarred with the one brush and exposed in the media as guilty before they had a proper hearing.</P>
    <P>When accusations are levelled at politicians, be they national or local, they are automatically deemed guilty. Ireland is a small country in which a simple comment can lead to a person being condemned without trial and result in the end of his or her career. We must ensure any structure we put in place will ensure complaints will be tried and tested before they become public and constitute the subject of an inquiry by the commission. Members of the Oireachtas, local politicians and civil servants deserve to be protected until such time as a complaint is substantiated to the point where it comes before the commission. Once a complaint comes before the commission, the accusations, which should be spelt out clearly, should be communicated to the person involved who should have the right to defend himself or herself with the assumption of innocence until his or her wrongdoing is proven. I hope the finer points of the legislation will be thrashed out on Committee Stage in order that the Bill will provide a right of protection for those who come before the commission.</P>
    <P>Sanctions must be provided but, in deciding what they should comprise, we must bear in mind that Members of the House are elected by their constituencies and only their constituents can take their seat away. Only in the case of extreme wrongdoing should the Oireachtas have the power to take away that right. A range of sanctions should apply for minor breaches of responsibilities as public representatives to breaches of a more serious nature. We should observe the workings of other parliaments in regard to the imposition of penalties. Reference was made to financial penalties and expulsion from the House. A Member could be expelled for a particular period with an associated loss of income. We are very restricted in what we can do in this area. We must also consider what penalties or restrictions can be imposed on members of the Judiciary and civil servants found in breach of <Col N="69" /> their contracts or the subject of a commission hearing, be it removal from their positions or suspension from their employment for a designated time.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to making the Ceann Comhairle, who protects the rights of Members, the chairperson of the commission. The legislation states that a judge or a similar person would be the chairperson, but Members must take care of their own business. Other legislation has removed the rights of politicians to be part of a democratic process. That has been taken out of the control of the House and given to independent bodies. The implication is that this ensures the process is not corrupt and that says something about politicians.</P>
    <P>The NRA and other agencies are not accountable to the House. The implication is that they are cleaner because they are outside the realm of corrupt politicians. However, that is not the case. A new breed of politicians is entering the House. Similar to politicians in the past, the vast majority of them are dedicated to the democratic process and willing to play their part in a constructive manner. In terms of the State's agencies, they are anxious that they should be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. As elected Members, we should take our responsibilities seriously and ensure that those agencies work in a transparent fashion and are accountable to the House. This is our job as Members of the Parliament and it is not right that agencies that are funded by Europe or the Department of Finance are outside the remit of the House and not directly accountable to it.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about increasing our role as legislators and parliamentarians and putting in place legislation that will make us more accountable and enable the public to be aware of our various disclosures and understand our work, we should be responsible enough to state that we want to ensure agencies and civil servants function in the same manner. They should be as accountable to the House and, in turn, the public as elected representatives. An issue arises in relation to civil servants and how they conduct their business. As Members who are in contact with local government regularly will understand, when one contacts officials, one is told they are not available because they are participating in interview boards. They interview one another for various positions and this should be taken out of the control of civil servants. An independent board, comprising people from outside local government and the House, should conduct interviews. This would enable civil servants to remain at their desks, doing the work for which they were appointed. It would also ensure a more transparent system that everybody understood. The public is concerned about this matter.</P>
    <P>Issues about which people are concerned should be dealt with in a much more reasonable fashion without the need for detailed legislation that will tie up Members' in terms of tribunals, the workings of committees of the House or the <Col N="70" /> legal process. Undoubtedly, some of this Bill will be challenged legally. Another issue relates to committees of the House and reform of the Dáil. If it is necessary to implement this legislation &ndash; I welcome the cleaning up of politics &ndash; there is a need to give powers to the House to enable Members to act as true parliamentarians. We should not be placed in straitjackets.</P>
    <P>Two committees recently faced questions about their legal status. The committees must be brought up to date and given legal powers to investigate and scrutinise the affairs and agencies of the State. This is what the public wants and it is our responsibility, as parliamentarians, not only to deliver on legislation that will police our activities and establish a proper code of conduct, but to extend that to committees. Powers must be given to committees to investigate and scrutinise the agencies which act on our behalf outside the House. It should be possible to bring in the relevant people and conduct our affairs in a similar way to other countries. There are many European and American models in that regard. This will ensure the House has a better way of doing its business. The House is undoubtedly tied to decisions that were made 20 years ago. The Parliament does not function in the modern and efficient manner one would expect in a democracy in a developed country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and the debate it has created. However, I point out to the Members who will consider the Bill on Committee Stage that there is a need to study all the other legislation passed by the Houses and the Bills that are due to be introduced in relation to this issue. They should scrutinise these matters in a way that ensures there is one body of legislation that can be easily understood. This will ensure no Member is misled or misunderstands the position and, most importantly, that the public sees that we are adhering to what they want, which is a cleaning up of politics and the establishment of rules and regulations. I support the Bill in that context and I look forward to a detailed debate on these issues in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because any improvement in standards in public life is most welcome. This process has been ongoing for many years and standards have improved. If one compares the indiscretions committed in this State to those committed elsewhere, Ireland fares extremely well, particularly regarding corruption. However, I ask the Minister to consider creating a greater role for committees. I acknowledge the Minister's statement that committees have been consulted about the Bill. This is a good development because it is ensures that elected representatives, backbenchers in the main, will have an opportunity to examine and promote their ideas regarding acceptable standards in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message from that process is that Members are aware of the need to maintain discipline in the Legislature. If one reads the history of democratic states or considers the position in autocratic <Col N="71" /> states, there was much wrongdoing by members of parliament. However, our Parliament has benefited from the fact that there are 166 Members of the Dáil who all keep an eye on each other. In multi-seat constituencies, each Deputy is fully aware of what is happening there and plays a type of policeman's role in relation to his or her colleagues. In the main, backbenchers have played a good role since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>If one considers the membership of the Dáil, many professions are featured. It was originally dominated by people with farming interests, but it is now much more diverse. People from all walks of life are now Members. However, following the enactment of the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Freedom of Information Act, many people shied away from entering Parliament because they considered that legislation an intrusion on their privacy. This Bill goes further in the demands it imposes on privacy. It includes relatives under the category of &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo; and some will be taken aback by the trustee and beneficial relationships described, including business partners, relatives and companies. When the committee is examining this matter safeguards should be provided for. This is a small country and competitors could easily glean information.</P>
    <P>Parliament needs to reform in line with the changing times. Double jobbing involving membership of local authorities and the Oireachtas cannot be justified. Much watchdog work can be done by the committees. For example, the Estimates are examined too frivolously. They should be examined on an ongoing basis in the committee system. As it stands, the system is very slipshod in that Members are given just enough notice to inform them of what is proposed. They would need to be very alert to get behind some of the details involved. Transparency does not appear to be a criterion to be adhered to by those producing the Estimates but that can be changed. Allowing for an ongoing examination of them would be in line with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some Members argue that there are too many committees but the Government got the number right. There should be a committee for each Department and their role should be better defined in legislation. They should also be given increased responsibilities. Many hesitate over this aspect but the committees can be useful forums for producing good ideas on the formulation of legislation which can then be transmitted to the Department for inclusion in Bills. At present the role is reversed. The public service produces the legislation which is then examined by the committees. This means that the competence of Parliament is stifled. While the current Administration has improved matters, there is a need to reconsider the role of the committees in conjunction with this legislation.</P>
    <P>If the provisions on tax compliance for Members are rigidly imposed by the commission, many will get into trouble. It is always possible to <Col N="72" /> have ongoing arguments with the Revenue Commissioners about the details of one's obligations. The tax compliance requirements should be flexible enough to allow those in dispute with the Revenue Commissioners about certain matters to submit a certificate indicating that discussions with the Revenue are ongoing and a resolution will eventually be reached. In addition, tax compliance is seen as a burden on business people and this acts as a disincentive to them standing for election to the Oireachtas. There is a need to re-examine this area.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of expulsion from the Dáil as a penalty, including consequent loss of income. Perhaps the parties could agree to discontinue the unruly situations that have arisen recently. They do not become anyone. It could be the reason RTE is not inclined to broadcast proceedings from the House until after midnight when there will be fewer viewers. Perhaps the biggest complaint is the television depiction of vacant benches. People rightly ask questions about the interest of their politicians in public office. For example, they may ask the reason I did not say something about the tribunals and condemn previous mishaps.</P>
    <P>We should make our own standards. That is what the Bill is about. The Minister should provide for a more inclusive role for committees. If so, the legislation will be a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The background to the legislation is set out in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, which undertakes to restore confidence in public life through a credible policing mechanism for ethical issues and to follow up on the recommendations of the McCracken tribunal. That tribunal undertook important work and made a number of recommendations. Some of the key recommendations include the need for an independent third party to monitor and investigate possible contraventions of the ethics Acts, that the making of a false declaration under the Ethics in Public Office Act should be a criminal offence, that consideration should be given to providing that a person found guilty of such an offence should be ineligible to become a Member of either House, for a limited period or permanently and that it be a requirement for any candidate seeking election to either House to produce a tax clearance certificate and related declarations. These wide ranging recommendations have been fully taken account of in this legislation. It is not possible to implement them as specifically as Mr. Justice McCracken had suggested but the essence of most of them has been taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that in July 1998 the Government issued what is known as the blue book, a booklet dealing with proposals for a Standards in Public Office Bill. The book was referred to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service of which I was a member. A sub-committee was established to examine it in detail and go through <Col N="73" /> it paragraph by paragraph. We were confused as to the reason we were given this job but it is important to note that there should have been an all-party discussion, review and recommendations before legislation was introduced. Essentially the blue book amounted to a discussion document which we were asked to consider on an all-party basis and make recommendations before the heads of a Bill were agreed. From that point of view it was a useful exercise. We issued a report in April of the following year. Much work went into the report and much of the contents have been referred to by the Minister. Some of them have been incorporated but some of our recommendations were not accepted. The reasons they were not taken on board have been spelt out by the Minister but I will comment on some of them in detail.</P>
    <P>I found that very interesting because I was a new Member of the Oireachtas in 1998 when we got the blue book to consider. We put forward a detailed proposal and laid a report before the House in April 1999 and, as a new Deputy in the House of less than two years standing, I took either the brave or foolish step of putting forward a minority report. I discussed it with all members of the committee and, interestingly, at that time Michael McDowell, spokesman for the Labour Party, was not able to commit to the suggestions I put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy give way? I can say without fear of contradiction that, whatever Michael McDowell was, he was not a member of the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for clarifying that point.</P>
      <P>Also on that committee was Deputy Noonan, the then spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party and he was not in a position to put his name, on behalf of the party, to the report I put forward. It left me in an unusual predicament. By way of an appendix to that report, I had filed a minority report and people felt I was being either a little brave or foolish depending on to whom one spoke. The Minister for Finance will appreciate from where I was coming and that when one is convinced an opinion is right one sticks with it and takes the consequences. I am pleased to be in the Dáil to say the essence of that minority report has now been accepted across the House. It was not accepted by Fine Gael or the Labour Party at the time, or by my party, which meant that I had to go on a solo run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of those proposals was very sim<Col N="74" /> ply, to eliminate all large donations to political parties or to individual candidates. There is quite a distinction drawn between corporate and private donations &ndash; one can get over excited about that definition &ndash; and the Revenue Commissioners can well distinguish between a corporate entity and a private individual when it comes to tax returns. It is very easy to discern the difference between the two issues. Nevertheless, when eliminating all large donations to parties and candidates the definition does not matter very much. I called for increased Exchequer funding for parties, so there would not be a reliance on the private sector, so that there would be full public accountability and for all parties to publish their accounts which would be individually audited and laid before the House every year. A few short weeks after I made that minority report Deputy Quinn, the leader of the Labour Party, went to his annual conference, took my report verbatim and announced it as Labour Party policy. I am very pleased that the day Deputy Noonan was elected leader of Fine Gael he took precisely, word perfect again, the same recommendations and it also pleases me very much that my party has also come around to the position I have been holding. The days of large donations have passed their sell-by date and under the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, currently before the Seanad, amendments will come from the Government for the first time in the history of the State, to introduce drastic legislation to prohibit donations above a certain figure. We have had disclosure of donations under legislation passed in 1997 but we have not ever had legislation on the Statute Book whereby donations above a certain figure would be prohibited. I am particularly pleased the figure will be quite a low one and whether it is £2,000 or £5,000 it will prevent all donations of £10,000 to £100,000 or even more. That will be a thing of the past and will not happen again. As a new Member of Dáil Éireann I am very pleased by that.</P>
    <P>During our debate on the blue book at the sub-committee, there was much discussion of the role of public servants, civil servants, those working for local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees, State-sponsored bodies, An Bord Pleanála and the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, the Independent Radio and Television Commission. We felt there was undue focus on politicians and we came to the conclusion that there were people in senior positions in some of the bodies I have mentioned who were guilty of corruption. That was in the public arena at the time. It would not be correct to pass legislation relating just to the 200-odd Members of the Oireachtas, it should also relate to many in strong positions in those types of bodies who were not covered by the Act. I am very pleased they are now included and I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will specify body by body exactly which group will be included in the legislation and what category of employee, in terms of <Col N="75" /> grade, will be covered. I look forward to those details being specified.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, a new rolling commission will be established on a permanent basis which will obviate the need for many of the tribunals. It will be an independent body to which the public can make complaints and it will have powers of tribunal, investigation, report and recommendation. It will have the same powers as a tribunal and will be a better way to conduct affairs rather than having to set up a tribunal every time there is one serious allegation. The commission will be chaired by a retired judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court, and its membership will include the Clerk of the Dáil, the Clerk of the Seanad, the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General. On Committee Stage the Government has not taken on board my suggestion that the Garda Commissioner be a member. Essentially the role of this body is to carry out investigations and we have gone too far down the legal route as opposed to the investigative route. Who are the best people to carry out investigations if not the Garda? Someone from the Garda should be on the commission and possibly a county manager, or someone of that sort, because we are not just dealing with allegations against Members of the Oireachtas, we are dealing with a wide range of people in the public service. The Government has given the reasons for not accepting my suggestions and wants to keep it to those independent people to carry out the job. I accept that and note there will be an amendment whereby one retired Member of the Oireachtas will be on the commission so it can benefit from the experience of someone who has served in the Houses.</P>
    <P>Another issue of concern is that of connected persons. That includes relatives, friends and business partners and is being used by the tribunals under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, as the definition under which we all operate. It can be very cumbersome and many people going forward for election do so on the basis of their own reputation and standing. No one can stand up and swear an oath on everything every relative has done in the past. There is a reason to have that in the legislation so people conferring benefits on others can be caught, but it will lead to difficulties. Under this Bill codes of conduct are to be drawn up before the legislation is fully enacted, which we were very committed to at the sub-committee. People will know the codes of conduct under which they are operating be they elected representatives, public servants or Ministers. There is no point in passing legislation and saying the code of conduct will come some time later. Without codes of conduct we would all operate in a no-man's land and it is therefore essential we have them.</P>
    <P>The Government, in consultation with the commission, will draw up the code of conduct for Ministers and the legislation so far says the commission will draw up the code of conduct for TDs. <Col N="76" /> The Department of Finance will do so for public employees and public servants. The Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service has already considered the discussion on the code of conduct for employees, but I notice in the Minister's speech this morning he is making an amendment on Committee Stage to say that the code of conduct will be drafted by a select committee in consultation with the commission. He disagreed with our committee on that and we do not have any problem with the Minister's proposal as all we wanted was to have a code of conduct. I do not mind who draws it up once we all know to what it relates. That will be significant and I look forward to it getting under way.</P>
    <P>Complaints to the new commission will be by way of writing or other such form as specified by the commission. They must be matters of significant public importance regarding an act in the performance of a person's duties or an act inconsistent with maintaining public confidence in that performance. If there is a benefit of more than £10,000, it will be deemed to be a significant act requiring investigation. When an inquiry is lodged, the commission will appoint an inquiring officer who can issue reports stating there should be a full investigation, it does not merit a full investigation or, alternatively, it does not merit a full investigation but should be referred to the relevant committee of the House or the relevant head of the Department of which the person is an employee. It is important to recognise that the commission will not have the power to issue sanctions. It, like the tribunals, is not a court of law. It will issue reports to the relevant authorities, including the Director of Public Prosecutions, if there is a need to do so. However, it will not be in a position to issue findings. The evidence given at the inquiries will not be admissible in criminal proceedings. That is a mirror image of what is happening at the tribunals.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about tax clearance certificates. A declaration must be made within one month of an election and nine months thereafter there should be a final certificate. This will cause difficulties for some in genuine dispute with the Revenue Commissioners. I hope they will be strong enough to hold their ground and not concede on an issue on a point of principle. Once the application statement has been sought and obtained, Members of the House should have the same rights as everyone else to deal with their tax affairs in an orderly manner and not be forced to rush them because of the new time limit. Every Member of the House should be tax compliant.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that it will be an offence to obstruct the commission in its work. Perhaps it could be clarified on Committee Stage how much the new commission is likely to cost and who will pay the costs of those making a complaint and the person to whom a complaint relates. Will retired Members of the Oireachtas or retired public servants come under the Bill? Will they be responsible for acts they carried out <Col N="77" /> many years earlier when Members of the House or employed in a public capacity? </P>
    <P>One paragraph in the Minister of State's speech was unusual. A complaint can be made against any member of the Government or any public servant to the new commission, but a complaint against a Deputy must be made to the Clerk of the Dáil and dealt with through the Committee on Members Interests or a similar committee. The public will have a big problem with this. It will see it as an attempt to screen complaints against Deputies. I am told the reason is that the Constitution states that the Houses of the Oireachtas must regulate the affairs of Deputies and it is not for a commission to do so. However, a formula must be found whereby the complaint can be fully investigated by the commission and then come back to the Oireachtas committee which can regulate the Member's affairs by taking what action is required. The public will be cynical of any attempt by the House to judge a complaint against a Deputy before it goes to the commission.</P>
    <P>This is a significant weakness in the legislation of which I was not aware until this afternoon. It must be addressed because we want to maintain public confidence in public administration. This issue will be challenged as time passes. I ask the Minister to discuss with the Attorney General ways of ensuring complaints against Deputies are dealt with in the same way as complaints against public servants and Ministers. The report can then come back to the House where regulations can be made. There is nothing in the Constitution which prevents a commission from carrying out an investigation. It cannot impose sanctions as that is a matter for the House and ultimately the electorate. We must find some way to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I look forward to Committee Stage of the Bill where we can thrash out the finer details. I welcome the general support for the Bill across the House. I hope it is passed and enacted before the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it had to be viewed in the context of what he called a wider raft of legislation, on which I will comment shortly. Someone should mention the proposition behind the Bill and other imminent legislation. Only detailed statutes can keep Members of the House on the straight and narrow. It is regrettable if it has come to this. It is a lamentable reflection on modern society, not just on this Parliament, if the view across the House is that unless we have detailed legislation and codes of conduct, we cannot rely on the Members elected to the House by the people to conduct themselves <Col N="78" /> in accordance with appropriate standards. I do not believe that is the case, but I accept that politics has been debased to such an extent and corrosive public cynicism has reached such a level that we must take certain measures to put some of these questions beyond reproach. No detailed statute, no matter how complex or comprehensive, will prevent a corrupt politician from being corrupt. Whatever findings the tribunals may bring home about corruption, it will not be because of defects in the law. <i>Prima facie</i> laws have existed and would appear to have been broken, particularly in the area of tax compliance. I do not know what the findings of the tribunals will be, but it will not be because people did not know the difference between right and wrong or because of an absence of law.</P>
      <P>It says something about our modern society. There is no point pretending that Members of the House are not representative of our society. Whatever its downside, the proportional representation system has thrown up Members of the House who are truly reflective of the population. It is a sad reflection that we have come to the stage where we have to provide in law for proper standards and compliance with the laws we have the privilege to make in the House.</P>
      <P>The fact the Minister draws to our attention the raft of legislation in which the Bill must be seen or judged makes me a bit dubious about this limited exercise. When one looks at the record of the Government in respect of this raft of legislation, it is difficult to see the colour of its money. The two major Acts referred to by the Minister are the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Freedom of Information Act, both introduced by the previous rainbow Government. Since the resignation in that famous September of the former Minister and Deputy, Ray Burke, the Taoiseach has promised a raft of legislation, of which there is no evidence other than the limited Bill before the House which was born out of the debate that preceded the election of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party introduced two Bills &ndash; the Whistleblowers Protection Bill, 1999, and the Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 1999. I introduced the Whistleblowers Protection Bill which the Government accepted at Second Stage but it has not been seen since. The Registration of Lobbyists Bill goes to the heart of what we seek to address, yet we have not seen it since its introduction. On the subject of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, the Taoiseach promised the party leaders last June that he would restrict corporate donations before the end of 2000 but we have not yet seen the shape of these restrictions to which Deputy Fleming has just referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no evidence of the legislation which I assume that the Taoiseach, being the Taoiseach, will publish just before the general election. I do not want the other side of the House to think, however, that I am without admiration for his skill in that area. He wrote a piece in <i>The Irish <Col N="79" />Times</i>, the Minister for Finance's favourite broadsheet&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, perhaps, its favourite politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Without doubt. I concede the point. He wrote a piece on 4 December 2000 elaborating on this matter, again telling us that the time had come to restrict corporate donations. On 15 December 2000 the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, published the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, with a detailed press release in which it was stated that the Government had decided to limit corporate donations and that the amendments were about to be published. The Minister has an unfortunate record in making promises. The unfortunate man is under the ferule of the Independent Member for Kerry South and has not been able to deliver on any promise in any area. However, he managed in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill to increase spending limits in a general election. That is the only thing of which we know the shape. We do not yet know what the restrictions on corporate donations will be. In a Seanad debate in March 2000, the Minister again promised that the amendments would be ready &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;. He repeated this promise at Question Time on 4 April. We have not seen the amendments as the Minister is stringing out the matter.</P>
      <P>Now, when the Taoiseach receives his speaking notes each day &ndash; the notes which anticipate the issues of the day &ndash; he has a standard note in answer to Deputy Quinn's regular questions about corporate donations. He has a page on the subject which rhymes out ten pieces of legislation, more legislation than anywhere in the western world, the Taoiseach claims. This is all in his mind. We have not seen the shape of any legislation; yet, the Taoiseach says it is coming. It is coming like the general election is coming, and if I was a betting man, I would say that the general election will come first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has to be seen in the context of this raft of legislation. It is an irritant and does not address the wider issues. I accept that Deputy Killeen and the committee did a good job on the detail, making recommendations, making the Bill sensible and trying to prevent a situation where innocent breaches might entrap Members. The committee tried to deal with the question of frivolous complaints against Members and struggled with the concept of connected persons. I accept this, but the Bill is a modest measure which does little other than give the Taoiseach fig leaf cover to suggest he is dealing with the environment that has debased politics. I can almost picture him using his peculiar speaking habit where the first half of the sentence goes one way and the second goes the other way. I attend each Order of Business and cannot figure out what he means to say. However, this method gets him through each day <Col N="80" /> expertly. The purpose of the Bill is to get him through this situation.</P>
    <P>I arrived in the House towards the end of Deputy Fleming's contribution. He said he had introduced a minority report, which I thought would ban corporate donations. However, he seemed to leave the way open to merely minimising such donations rather than banning them. He told the House he had brought Deputies Quinn and Noonan behind the measure. He has, therefore, brought the Labour Party and the Fine Gael party behind it and said he was well on the way to bringing the Fianna Fáil Party behind it also. That is a considerable achievement for a Deputy who said he was only two years in the House prior to suggesting the measure. I do not decry him being the author of such proposals. He has much experience in the area of corporate donations, in keeping donations counted and in keeping the books. No Member of the House knows more about such matters than Deputy Fleming. I am sure he acted in accordance with the highest professional standards as a professional person. Therefore, I take seriously what he suggests. I am dubious, however, about the proposition with which he has swung the Labour Party and Fine Gael behind him &ndash; perhaps that is not the way it happened. It is a great pity, however, he could not swing Fianna Fáil in behind him. If he could do so, we would be in business.</P>
    <P>The real issue is whether private money can purchase public men. It is a shame it has come to this. There should be no difficulty about the interaction between business and politics. Anyone holding office or with influence in their local constituency who is not concerned to interact with business is not doing the best job for his or her constituents. Unfortunately, due to known high profile cases, when the nexus of politics and business takes place behind closed doors and financial contributions of the order Deputy Fleming put on the record of the House this afternoon can be transferred in secret, there are few in the House who would not be the subject of allegations that they favour a particular business or person. For this reason, the banning of corporate donations is the only way to deal with the issue. Otherwise, we lay ourselves open to the allegations that now feature so easily in the media.</P>
    <P>We have lost all sense of balance and proportion. An employee of a local authority who designs a porch for his or her mother-in-law's home is put on the same plane, in some media coverage, as the unfortunate former assistant Dublin county manager. That is the environment in which we work. I hope we are going through a cathartic phase and the tribunals will bring to an end the corrosive cynicism about politics. We have an obligation to uphold the laws we make. We must be careful to put in place some form of consolidated code because, on foot of the number of trip wires that now exist, Deputies who could be innocent of any serious breach could find themselves the subject of allegations, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> I agree with Deputy Fleming that former Deputy Michael McDowell has many find equalities. However, membership of the Labour Party was not one of them. My colleague, Deputy Derek McDowell, made the point that there is a special obligation on Members who make the law to uphold it. We must win back the confidence of the people for whom politics has been debased as a result of what is happening outside the House.</P>
    <P>The application of the legislation to areas outside politics is an important issue. The question of the role of the media is particularly important in that regard. I take no pleasure in the fact that the focus of coverage of what might be termed &ldquo;public affairs&rdquo; has switched from the Houses to Dublin Castle. It is difficult to find in most broadsheets reference to what transpires in this House on a daily basis. Even the coverage of proceedings of the House in <i>The Irish Times</i> has been reduced to approximately one eighth of a page. The focus has been transferred to Dublin Castle and, regardless of the importance of the issues &ndash; whether they be hospital waiting lists, taxation or the other matters of import of the day &ndash; they cannot compare with scandal in terms of selling newspapers. Apparently, what happens here is dull, boring stuff as far as newspaper proprietors are concerned. That is a great pity.</P>
    <P>As regards the application of the legislation to senior civil servants, we are lucky to have and to have had, by and large, a very honest Civil Service. I am aware, however, that permanent office equals absolute power. If a political party remains in permanent office, it can exercise absolute power. Everyone knows what such power tempts and invites. As I reiterate my comments about senior civil servants in this country being uniquely honest, there is a view abroad that many senior civil servants nowadays are differently disposed to a Fianna Fáil dominated Administration than they would be to an Administration dominated by Fine Gael or Labour.</P>
    <P>Things are done more easily under Fianna Fáil for some reason. If one says &ldquo;Send the guns to Dundalk&rdquo; they are sent to Dundalk; if one says &ldquo;Build the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; it will be built; or if one says &ldquo;Buy the Boyne site&rdquo; it is bought. Can Members imagine what would have happened if Deputy Michael D. Higgins, the former eminent Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, had come to Cabinet one morning and suggested to the Taoiseach that we should spend up to £1 billion on building a football stadium? Can they imagine what the media would have said or what the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and his colleagues, then in Opposition, would have said? They would have nailed him to the cross. Thankfully, Deputy Michael D. Higgins did not do anything so daft. However, the boss to whom the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy answers &ndash; who was his party's hardline proponent of fiscal rectitude and moderation in public spending &ndash; has done so.</P>
    <P>The attitude to which I refer is a matter of con<Col N="82" /> cern to me, but it is merely an orientation I detect in certain quarters of the Civil Service and it has nothing to do with the subject matter of this Bill. Nor, has the cute hoor culture to which Deputy McDowell referred earlier. That culture should not be made equivalent to corruption. The cute hoor culture certainly has its defects. There are Members, particularly on the Fianna Fáil benches, who would say it has its advantages and they have certainly captured the constituency, by and large and to considerable effect. However, it is a long way from corruption. That distinction must be made.</P>
    <P>Whatever the venalities of public and business life, corruption is a different story and I do not believe any law will prevent the politician who wants to be bought being bought. I do not see anybody coming to the House and wanting to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; an Opposition Deputy. One might want to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; an influential member of a local authority or an officeholder, but will certainly not be bothered purchasing the services of an Opposition Deputy. Until we deal with the fundamental issue of corporate donations, this Bill is only a minor step and I am not sure it is intended to be enacted prior to the general election at the end of September.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation. Views have been expressed as to whether it represents an important step forward in putting together a corpus of laws in this area or whether it is a sop. I consider it an important Bill which builds, in general, in a positive way on previous legislation in this area. I am in general agreement with Deputy Rabbitte that if people are disposed to finding ways to transgress and if they are disposed to using political life as a vehicle to advance their financial interests or those of connected persons &ndash; I mean connected persons in a wider sense than that contained in the definition in the Bill &ndash; it would take more than legislation of this nature to address such behaviour.</P>
      <P>A great deal of research in respect of this matter, was conducted mainly in various third level institutions in different areas. I had an opportunity to read quite a proportion of that research during an enforced absence from the House. I was interested to discover that many researchers found that while a small proportion of politicians seem to be predisposed to trawling the system to find ways to illegally benefit themselves and others, there was a political climate in existence which either allowed or encouraged a particular kind of behaviour. The various tribunals will eventually make findings and people will conduct research on those findings and on the evidence which has come to light in public life over a considerable period. It is likely people will discover that a climate existed, at a particular juncture, in and around this House and politics in general which made certain activities a great deal more acceptable than they ought to have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is placed in that context, however small a step it might be in the view of those who <Col N="83" /> are critical of it, it is nonetheless an important step in the right direction and an acknowledgement that a legislative basis for directing people in terms of what are the requirements of good conduct is an important piece of a jigsaw that is notoriously difficult to put together. It is not merely the experience in this State which suggests this. Historical experience from various democracies and countries with other forms of government, indicates that people manage to find ways to err and to do much worse on occasion. Apart from the worst excesses &ndash; there are four or five cases before the tribunals which probably rank among these &ndash; the Irish experience has been particularly tame in terms of what people have managed to do on foot of the political positions they held.</P>
    <P>My contribution to this debate is informed, and perhaps somewhat jaundiced, by what I have learned on foot of my membership of the Dáil Select Committee on Members' Interests. I assure Members that, if I am returned to the next Dáil, I will happily serve on ten committees in order to escape serving on that one. I intend to ensure that will be the case if I am returned. It is hugely tedious work which requires a huge commitment of time, and almost all the work must, by its nature, be conducted behind closed doors. There is undoubted attendant stress and unpopularity for Members who investigate complaints about their peers.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the work of the other members of the committee. Almost always we reached decisions unanimously. When we did not, as happened on occasion, I was always on the minority side. Parties generally were split, which means people brought their own rather than their parties' perspectives to the various discussions. The committee recently prepared a draft code of conduct and laid it before the House. I will refer to that if I have time.</P>
    <P>The vexed question of the type of penalties which should apply in the case of a person found guilty of an offence is one which posed difficulty for the committee and for anyone who examined this area. The first attempt at expulsion of a Member of Parliament I can find was in the United States House of Representatives in 1798. It was unsuccessful because it was two votes short of the required two thirds' or three quarters' majority. There were subsequent cases in the House of Representatives, in one of which the Member against whom the complaint was made was refused the right to mount a defence on his behalf. I mention that because I share the fears expressed by a number of Members who spoke, that, in the rush to put this legislation in place, there is a danger of trampling on the rights of individual Members and on the rights of their constituents to be represented properly, as is required under the democratic mandate.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned international scandals. The United Kingdom House of Commons has had its own experiences, some of them recent and <Col N="84" /> well known in Ireland. I imagine all Members will have paid close attention to the Neil Hamilton hearings. For anyone who has the time and is disposed to do so, it is worth reading the transcripts of the Nolan committee, its report and the reasons it reached its determinations. While there were transgressions in the Hamilton case, one must question the relevance of the extremely unsavoury witch hunt conducted alongside it which added nothing to the attempt to have a better and more transparent and effective system in that Parliament or any other in the world.</P>
    <P>The blue book, which was mentioned by others and which produced this legislation and debate, was useful in several respects, not least of which was that members of three committees were charged with examining it in detail. I cannot help thinking that, had I not been a member of one of those committees, I would know no more than 5% of what I know about the legislative attempt to keep politicians in line and on the straight and narrow. I would be surprised were I to know more than I would obtain from a cursory reading of the guidelines issued annually by the committee and in which I would only seek whatever specific matter might be of concern to me. That is perhaps the greatest weakness in this Parliament and, I suspect, in many others. Members are so busy chasing issues for constituents and dealing with legislation that they seldom give themselves the opportunity to consider the wider issue of their role as parliamentarians, what Parliament might do and what it does frequently that it should not do. That is the background against which this legislation is set.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change indicated by the Minister of State in the composition and membership of the commission which will allow for a former Member of the Houses to be a member of the commission. It is unlikely that those who have not sat in Parliament will be aware of the type of difficulties and conflicts a Member is required to address in undertaking his or her parliamentary work.</P>
    <P>All the committees which examined the blue book recommended that the issue of lobbyists be addressed. Perhaps this legislation is not the vehicle for doing it but dealing with that matter is no less urgent. If anything, some of the revelations since that time have made it much more urgent. I am sure few would argue with Deputy Rabbitte's contention and the contention of others that it is more important legislation than this.</P>
    <P>Another matter which exercised the committees was dealing with anonymous complaints. Everyone's immediate gut reaction is to discount them and bin them, but recent experience suggests that there must be a means to accommodate the person who has a genuine complaint to make and who runs the risk of being fired, ill-treated or suffering catastrophically by bringing the matter to public attention. Deputy Rabbitte's Whistleblowers Protection Bill, to which he referred, needs to be acted on. The Minister of State said <Col N="85" /> in his opening address that it is being examined and that it will be put to the committee shortly. I welcome that. The Bill is an important and fundamental consideration in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which deals with the powers of the commission, addresses and amends section 23 of the 1995 Act, generally by adding or substituting powers. It is important Members are aware that the powers of the commission are the full powers of a tribunal, and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the manner in which section 14 is drafted if it means what I think it does. It states that a person may not refuse to answer questions or produce documents on the grounds that they may be self-incriminating. This is something which could be argued from either side. There are exclusions relating to sections 32(4) and (5) of the 1995 Act which appear either superfluous or contradictory and I am not sure which. The issue of self-incrimination in transposing whatever may have been dealt with before the commission into any subsequent criminal proceedings which may arise could well be important. It might transgress the rights of an individual and, more importantly, protect the individual in certain circumstances from future criminal proceedings. It is something which needs to be examined closely on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The committees expressed the view that thresholds should be increased if certain penalties were to be introduced. It is something I agree with although I would not get hung up on it. The four or five sections which deal with tax clearance certificates are to be welcomed in general terms although a number of Members raised certain questions about them. They can be addressed successfully on Committee Stage. Section 10 goes some way towards consolidating the declaration requirements, but they require further streamlining. I do not have any doubt that it would be possible to have one declaration statement under electoral and ethics legislation. It is extremely desirable that that be the case.</P>
    <P>The representatives' committee drew attention to the existing title of the committee which unfortunately is confused with the Members' services committee in which almost everyone has an interest at some stage. It is confused further by the fact that the same individual is Chairman of both committees. The opportunity should be taken in the Bill to change the name of the committee to the Committee on Standards and Ethics of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, as appropriate. That would be helpful for many reasons, not least that it would reduce the level of confusion that besets Members about the roles of the two different committees.</P>
    <P>The matters being examined by tribunals, in so far as they affect Members of the Houses, appear to refer only to their activities when they were either Ministers or members of local authorities. I do not recollect any complaint of great consequence directed at a Member arising from his or her membership of the Dáil or Seanad. There are many complaints about what people are <Col N="86" /> alleged to have done and may have done as Ministers and a raft of complaints about what people might have done when they were members of local authorities. I have not heard the Minister use it as an argument but it appears to be a convincing case for ending the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>Section 4(5)(<i>b</i>) contains a definition of the term &ldquo;significant public importance&rdquo;. Basically, it means a pecuniary interest. I am not sure it is in the interest of legislation to have it in this format. This matter should be looked at on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The interaction between the Committee on Members' Interests and the commission needs to be tightened up considerably. The <i>modus operandi</i> to be followed regarding complaints is not clear.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the students summer jobs scheme.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15342/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult to obtain work during the summer holiday period. Consequently participation levels in the scheme initially were very high. For example, in 1994 more than 9,000 students took part. This increased to more than 15,000 in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Since 1997 the take-up has been dropping gradually, coinciding with the upsurge in the economy and the wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs. Last year 5,800 students took part in the scheme. The bulk of these came from the western seaboard. This year we anticipate a further drop of about 20% in participation levels.</P>
      <P>That the level of interest in the scheme has been in decline in recent years due to the wide availability of well paid summer jobs is an encouraging trend, as it is obviously better for students to obtain work in the open market than to have to rely on support from the scheme. Furthermore, any scheme which removes young people from the mainstream labour supply could have a negative impact on, for example, the hotel and tourism industry, particularly during the busy summer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme will operate this year from 1 June <Col N="87" /> to 30 September and approved students will be allowed to undertake 200 hours work at £3 per hour, giving a possible total maximum tax free payment of £600. In order to focus resources where the need is greatest, if the student comes from a household which is dependent on social welfare payments he or she will be paid at a rate of £4 per hour, providing for a maximum payment of £800. In addition, approved students who are in receipt of disability allowance or blind person's pension will be eligible to participate in the scheme this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Minister set an hourly rate of pay for this scheme of £3, which is £1.40 less than the national minimum wage? The Minister is aware that minimum wage legislation was passed in the year 2000 and sets out clearly that the basic rate of pay per hour should be £4.40. Why is the Minister breaking the law, flouting the regulations and introducing sweatshop rates of pay for very important work in the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme pre-dates the minimum wage legislation. It was not included in the legislation and was not intended to be. The minimum wage only applies to commercial employment where there is an income tax and PRSI liability. In this instance there is no employer, as such, and the work is community based. It is completely different from the commercial type of employment. In recent years employers have been crying out for people to work, particularly in the hotel and tourism industry during the summer months. Students have been voting with their feet by going into better paid summer employment. It is better for the State and taxpayers that students are not a burden.</P>
      <P>This was a good scheme when there were high levels of unemployment, particularly in the early 1990s. That is why the scheme was introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Woods. Times have moved on. Schemes which were relevant several years ago are not relevant now and I am thankful for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>To what sections of the National Minimum Wage Act does the Minister refer when he suggests the scheme is exempt from the minimum wage legislation? The Minister is applying double standards. He is asking businesses and others in the public and private sector to obey the national minimum wage legislation while he and his Department are operating a scheme which pays less than the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The numbers involved in the scheme will decline again this year. However, the real losers will not only be students but the many voluntary and community activities which need students' participation during the summer period.</P>
      <P>To what section of the Act does the Minister refer when he says he believes the scheme is excluded from the legislation?</P>

      <P>I do not have the legislation before me. The Deputy is not comparing like with like. The scheme does not provide the type of paid commercial employment which was envisaged in the minimum wage legislation. Jobs provided by the scheme carry no tax or PRSI liability and there is no employer. It is my view and the view of my Department that it is not covered in the minimum wage legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his Department are now open to a legal challenge from any student who is employed under the scheme. Section 5 of the National Minimum Wage Act does not refer to the students summer jobs scheme and the advice he has been given by his officials is deficient.</P>
      <P>I ask him again to review the paltry sum of money he is offering students this summer under the scheme. Does he believe it morally right that he should lecture the private sector about its obligations when he is running schemes in his Department which pay £1.40 less than the national minimum wage?</P>

      <Quest>if he is planning any initiatives to address the level of poverty among one parent families which was highlighted in a recent NESF report.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15307/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum &ndash; NESF &ndash; held a plenary session on Monday 14 May 2001 to discuss the draft report of its project team on lone parents. There is nothing in the draft report to support recent media reports that the risk of poverty for lone parents has increased six-fold since 1981. One newspaper subsequently published a correction to its misleading report. The data in the report indicate that the poverty risk for lone parent families, that is, the numbers who fall below the 50% income poverty line, increased from 17% in 1987 to 29% in 1994. Recent data indicate that it has remained at that level in 1997.</P>
      <P>That said, lone parents and their children remain one of the groups in society who are most at risk of poverty. Accordingly, a range of measures has been introduced to improve the overall incomes of lone parents and to deal with their training and education needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the most effective route out of poverty is through employment. <Col N="89" /> The earnings disregard is a major feature of the one-parent family payment which is designed to </P>
    <P>recognise the additional costs which a lone parent may face in moving into employment. The Department's review of the one-parent family payment, published last year, found that approximately 60% of recipients supplement their social welfare payments with earnings, which is an encouraging statistic.</P>
    <P>Arising from the review, I included provisions in the Social Welfare Act, 2001, to allow lone parents to retain 50% of any maintenance received. It is hoped this measure will improve the overall income for lone parents as well as facilitating the payment of maintenance by the other parent.</P>
    <P>Also following the review, I initiated a pro-active programme for one-parent family payment recipients to ensure that they are aware of the employment, education and training opportunities available to them. This includes a systematic programme of interviews for selected groups to advise and assist them in accessing supports.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to localise the administration of the scheme from the pension services office in Sligo to the Department's local offices. In this regard, arrangements for a pilot scheme have been put in place recently in the Department's Tallaght office. This move will bring lone parents into closer contact on an ongoing basis with the various support services available in the Department's offices and will therefore be useful in promoting the programmes available to encourage lone parents back into education, training and employment.</P>
    <P>In budget 2001 I announced changes to the back to education scheme designed to assist and encourage young lone parents to return to education. From this autumn the scheme will be available to 18 year olds who have been in receipt of the one-parent family payment for at least six months and who have been out of the education system for two years. I should also remind the Deputy that the Government is committed to dramatically increasing child benefit by £1 billion over the next three years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In budget 2001, I provided for an increase of £25 per month for each of the first and second children, and £30 per month for each of the third and subsequent children. These increases will come into effect in June this year, three months earlier than normal, and be of major benefit to lone parents.</P>
    <P>The Government is strongly committed to eliminating poverty for all our people and recognises the particularly high risk of poverty faced by lone parents. In this regard the position will be reviewed in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to wait until the autumn for the full report of the NESF on the level of poverty among lone parent households. Is it not a fact, however, that this is one of a series of reports produced during the years? I remem<Col N="90" /> ber, in particular, Out of Sight: the Hidden Poverty of Women, published by the National Women's Council which clearly indicated that at least one quarter of the almost 80,000 lone parent family households were living in absolute poverty. The facts indicate that this continues to be a very serious issue. The NAPS designated lone parents as one of the five key groups with which we should be dealing. It is, therefore, a serious problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned some of the measures he is prepared to take but throughout his four years in office he has left the earnings disregard alone. As he has often said that going out to work and having a part-time job is one of the best routes out of poverty, why did he not increase the disregard, given that he has had four years in which to do so? </P>
      <P>As regards the area of community employment, is it not a fact that women who head families on their own have taken most advantage of vital and socially useful jobs at local level? The Minister's colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, is, however, decimating that sector. As I tried to tell the Taoiseach a few days ago on the Order of Business, we have not replaced it with a social economy scheme. Everyone in the House is aware that social economy schemes play a major role in providing child care and other local development projects. Many women would be delighted to fill such posts but they are being crushed further. I noticed during the week that very trendy journalists&mdash;</P>

Even if it does not come under the aegis of his Department, he should ask the Tánaiste to lay off community employment, or else come back with a social economy programme which will encourage lone parents to return to work.

Soon after its publication I brought forward a number of initiatives, particularly the ability to retain maintenance payments, thus encouraging them to seek such payments.

      <P>As someone who works on the ground, the Deputy is aware the disregard caused many difficulties with married women working side by side with lone parents in the same job and earning the same money, yet not having the ability to retain a social welfare payment. While, on the one hand, it caused such difficulties, on the other, it prompted lone parents to enter the workplace.</P>
      <P>In the past year or two we have spent some time examining what other countries are doing about this matter. I had a working session with my counterpart in the United Kingdom to see exactly what was being done there, although we were not taking the same route. In the United Kingdom, the interaction between the Department responsible for social welfare and lone parents, on an individual basis, is much more compulsory than it is here.</P>
      <P>Our research has shown that many lone parents want to return to work, if given an opportunity to do so. That is the reason we made changes to the back-to-education allowance.</P>

      <P>The issues associated with the development of a benchmark and indexation methodology for social welfare payments are being examined and considered by the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group &ndash; a working group established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The group comprises representatives from each of the pillars of social partnership, as well as representatives of relevant Departments, with an independent chairperson.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the group's terms of reference require it to: first, examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in the light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns; and, second, to examine the issue of relative income poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has been meeting fortnightly since December 2000. It recently produced an interim report, copies of which I have placed in the Oireachtas Library. This interim report has also been distributed to representatives of the pillars <Col N="92" /> of the social partnership and can be found on my Department's website. It highlights the key issues which the group is addressing in seeking to achieve a consensus position on the range of issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of welfare payments, and the question of indexation or uprating of these payments.</P>
    <P>The group is continuing with its work and intends to complete it by the end of July 2001. It will produce its final report shortly thereafter. Given that it was specifically established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the issues involved, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to seek to pre-empt its findings at this stage. However, careful consideration and account will be taken of the conclusions reached by the group once its work has been completed, both in the context of the 2002 budget and the wider context of the development of welfare policy generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he accept that the new social welfare rises, effective from April this year, were predicated on a forecast inflation rate of just over 4%? We are already seeing cumulative inflation over the first and second quarters of this year running considerably ahead of this. We are also seeing food price inflation of nearly 8%, which has a most detrimental effect on low income families. Does the Minister agree that the benchmark he has set this year is now regarded as completely inadequate for thousands of low-income families? Will he give a commitment to the House that, between now and December, he will be prepared to reconsider the uprating of payments this year, given the continuous spiral of inflation which the Government has caused as a result of its inflationary policy? Will he consider this proposal, given the particular dilemma faced by many low-income families?</P>

      <P>The Minister is absolutely clear about this matter. He believes that poor people should wait 12 months to receive compensation in respect of inflation payments. He admitted this on Committee Stage. Does he accept that food price inflation is now running at 8%, that a substantial amount of the payments to those on low incomes is taken up purchasing food and the small increases he gave, effective from 1 April, have been negated as a result of the current spiral in inflation? Will he give a commitment to the House that he will review the position as we progress through the summer into the autumn? Despite the Minister thinking there is great cheer as a result of the small increases he has given, the reality is that there is little cheer among people on low incomes in our economy. Will the Minister define in one sentence what constitutes income adequacy?</P>

      <Quest>the progress he has made on individualising social welfare payments; his policy in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14599/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Individualisation already exists to a certain extent within the social welfare system. In the social insurance system, those who meet the contribution conditions receive a payment in their own right and also in the old age non-contributory pension arrangements whereby in the case of a couple, each over age 66, there is a joint means test and payment is then on an individual basis.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes published in August 1999, considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individuals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements. Much has already been achieved in this area in recent years with coverage being extended to the self-employed in 1988, to part-time workers in 1991 and new civil-public servants in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a very comprehensive system with almost all workers covered by social insurance and able to establish their individual <Col N="95" /> entitlements. In addition, measures were introduced in 1994 in the form of the homemaker's scheme to protect the insurance records of those who take time out from the paid work force for caring duties. These latter provisions are being reviewed in the context of the phase 2 review of the qualifying conditions for old age (contributory) and retirement pensions which is under way.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is to develop proposals to progress the individualisation of social welfare payments in the context of the continuation of joint assessment of means. It also envisages the wider implementation of administrative individualisation within the system. This could, for instance, involve paying the qualified adult allowance directly to the spouse or partner of a social welfare recipient. This is available in certain circumstances, for instance, where the recipient is not maintaining his or her partner or spouse. The working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes suggested that this should be available on a more general basis.</P>
    <P>A PPF working group on the implementation of administrative individualisation within the social welfare system was set up last October and is considering the issues surrounding this proposal. The Deputy will be aware that in budget 2001 I gave a commitment to increase the level of the qualified adult allowance for people over 66 years of age to the maximum rate of the old age (non-contributory) pension. As a first step towards this objective I provided an increase of £15 per week in the full qualified adult rate. Proposals relating to administrative individualisation will enhance this initiative and in the circumstances I am anxious to receive the report of the PPF group as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I refer to the ongoing issues regarding women's access to the live register. Why has the PPF working group, which is examining administrative individualisation in social welfare, not met since before Christmas? Women do not receive the full rate of unemployment payments and this means the number of women on the live register is understated. I am not sure whether the Minister is aware many women are having difficulty accessing FÁS courses, even though they should be able to, because they are not on the live register. Women who are taking up VTOS courses, for example, are being denied payment because they are not on the live register. Will the Minister outline his plans to allow women full access to signing on the live register so that they, in turn, can be made aware of the range of job, education and retraining opportunities that are available? There is still a barrier to women obtaining such infor<Col N="96" /> mation because they cannot access the live register as freely as they should be able to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said previously on Question Time individualisation was examined during the PPF negotiations and a working group was established. I do not know how often it has met but that can be checked. The group is examining administrative individualisation which will not progress the issue as much as I would like. That is one of the reasons generally old age pensioners over 66, particularly women, are disadvantaged because their records discontinued when they stopped work and stayed in the home. That is why I increased the QAA payment in the last budget and will do so again in the forthcoming budget. The number of younger women participating in the work force is higher than the EU average and, therefore, ultimately all of them will be able to access their social welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to access to the live register. A report was jointly launched by the Tánaiste and me regarding women's access to training and FÁS courses, etc. approximately a year ago. It contained approximately 42 recommendations. All those for which I was responsible have been implemented. The vast majority of recommendations came under the aegis of the Tánaiste. The Deputy should table a parliamentary question to her in this regard.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the number of people who have been awarded a pension based on pre-1953 contributions; and the number of applications being processed.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I was happy to introduce a special old age (contributory) pension, payable from 5 May 2000, for people with pre-1953 contributions who might otherwise not qualify for a pension or only for a reduced pension. Under these arrangements people who commenced insurable employment before 1953 and who had at least five years paid insurance comprising either pre-1953 contributions or a combination of pre &ndash; and post-1953 contributions can now qualify for pension. The pension payable amounts to 50% of the maximum weekly personal rate of pension, £48 from May 2000 increased to £53 from April 2001. Allowances for adult and child dependants, where applicable, are also payable at 50%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its introduction, a total of 17,000 applications have been received from people not previously in receipt of a pension from my Department, of which 7,700 have now been decided. Of these, some 5,400 people have been awarded a pre-1953 pension. In addition, my Department examined 13,800 cases where pensioners were receiving a <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension to <Col N="97" /> determine whether they had entitlement to a pre-1953 pension at a higher rate. Of those 8,500 have been awarded pre-1953 pensions bringing the total in receipt of the pre-1953 pension to almost 14,000. All of these pensions have been paid retrospective to 5 May 2000.</P>
    <P>The number receiving this payment is greater that my Department had anticipated initially. As a result there are 9,300 cases in various stages of processing. Processing of these cases is necessarily slower than the standard cases because, given the lapse of time since the relevant employment, there are difficulties in many cases in tracing contribution records. Every effort is made to process these applications as quickly as possible. Claimants can be assured that they will not lose out due to the delay and that their applications, if successful, will receive full arrears to 5 May last year.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the plans he has to bring forward proposals in relation to the difficulties facing families living on social welfare income in accessing sufficient rent supplement to keep them from becoming homeless, especially in view of spiralling rents in urban areas.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15292/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a system of income maintenance supports for people living on social welfare incomes who have difficulties in meeting their housing costs. Rent and mortgage interest supplements paid as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are designed for that purpose. These supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. There is also provision in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which allows health boards to assist people with rent deposits by way of an exceptional needs payment.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about escalating rents in the current housing market. There is a process in place to adjust rent supplement payment levels to take account of that. Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, for example, single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc., as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
      <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
      <P>Health boards must satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within the limits which they set. If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health boards have discretion to award a supplement based on the amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances, having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income maintenance payments deal with the symptoms of the problem but it is also necessary to deal with the underlying imbalances in the overall housing system. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities and will help to ensure that <Col N="101" /> a full range of housing options is made available to people with long-term housing needs, many of whom currently rely on supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The Government has also taken a number of other initiatives to improve the supply of social and affordable housing in response to the current housing situation. This is the best approach to meeting the housing needs of people living on social welfare incomes.</P>

      <P>What is the overall figure for rent supplement and for mortgage interest supplement? To give two examples of the type of cases that come to my desk from around the country, because I am spokesperson for the Labour Party in this area, in urban areas a rent of perhaps £600, where there would have been a rent supplement of £400, increased recently to £850&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rent went up by £200 or £250 but rent supplement only increased by £50 to £450 so, in effect, the tenant was left paying double the amount per week, £100, on lone parent's income. A separated person from the south has only been awarded £7 a week on the basis of a £100 mortgage she has to pay, based on social welfare income. Many Deputies would have countless similar examples.</P>

      <P>The number of people in receipt of rent allowance has generally remained the same over the past number of years &ndash; it has not increased. That is somewhat surprising given the difficulties regarding accommodation. Rents have gone up fairly dramatically over the past number of years. I have often stated that health boards have absolute discretion on the level of rent. They do not have to come to my Department or the Department of Finance to set the levels of rent. They do so based on their local knowledge.</P>
      <P>I can give the various maximum rent levels in each health board area for the years 1999 to 2000. However, while there are difficulties in certain areas, generally the rent allowance scheme works reasonably well and accommodates the fluctuations. As I said in the reply, there are cases where assistance, in addition to the maximum levels, has been given to enable people to meet their particular circumstances.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister deplore the practice whereby some landlords in the Dublin area refuse to accept tenants because they are in receipt of rent supplements?

      <P>The national action plans against poverty and social exclusion aim to translate the Community level objectives, endorsed in December 2000 by the Nice European Council, into each member state, taking account of national circumstances and policy priorities.</P>
      <P>An outline format for the national action plans was agreed by the EU social protection committee on 19 January. A seminar with officials from the relevant services of the EU Commission was held in Brussels on 28 March. The purpose of the seminar was to have an open exchange of information and debate with relevant stakeholders in Ireland &ndash; including the social partners and Government agencies such as the Equality Authority and the Economic and Social Research Institute &ndash; about the process of co-ordination on social inclusion and the preparation of the national action plans. A round table meeting held in May by my Department updated the social partners and other stakeholders on developments in relation to the preparation of the plan as well as allowing an opportunity to discuss equality issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The processes for consultation already in place for the national anti-poverty strategy and its review were helpful in drafting the plan. Written submissions from a range of interested parties were considered as part of the national plan process. Departments submitted workplans for the period 2001 to 2003 and examples of best practice <Col N="104" /> to the national anti-poverty strategy unit. The Combat Poverty Agency also had a key role in drafting elements of the plan. A draft of the plan has been considered by relevant stakeholders, including the social partners, before it is submitted to Government in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>Is it not extraordinary that the plan was not debated in the House? The plan is a significant development for the country, yet it was not brought to the Committee on Social Affairs, of which I am proud to be vice-chairman. Many of the stakeholders, the social partners and agencies which work in the area of deprivation are very angry because they were not consulted by the Minister, apart from a few derisory meetings.</P>
      <P>This is no way to fulfil a commitment in the Nice Treaty and roll out a realistic approach to this issue over the next five to ten years. The Minister inherited NAPS from the rainbow Government. However, after four years, in a lazy way the Minister is simply sending a copy of NAPS to Brussels. That is all he is doing. He is saying, &ldquo;Thanks to the rainbow Government, we were first. That is the way we do it in Ireland.&rdquo;  People are very angry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 14 and together.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999. Prior to this, farmers could receive unemployment assistance, generally referred to as &ldquo;smallholder's UA&rdquo;. Naturally, it took some time for existing recipients of smallholder's UA to apply for farm assist and be reassessed under the new scheme. For this reason, in order for trends in numbers and expenditure to be meaningful it is necessary to look at the combined numbers for farm assist and smallholder's UA, rather than at farm assist in isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of 1999, there were 7,874 recipients of farm assist-smallholder's UA, of whom 750 continued to receive smallholder's UA. By the <Col N="107" /> end of 2000, the combined numbers had increased to 8,051, of whom only 163 remained on smallholder's UA. Total expenditure on the two schemes was £29.8 million in 1999 and £34 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>On 18 May, there was a total of 7,994 farm assist claims in payment, of which 4,700 are former recipients of smallholder's UA who currently receive an average payment of approximately £102 per week. New applicants to farm assist are receiving an average payment of approximately £84 per week. A residue of 128 claimants are still in receipt of smallholder's UA pending completion of reviews of their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Arising from improvements I made to the scheme in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, income, including any off-farm self-employment income, is assessed at 70% for the purposes of the means test. In addition, £200 is disregarded for each of the first two children and £300 for each subsequent child in families. There are also changes to the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 capital held by the claimant disregarded and the balance treated more favourably than heretofore. These improvements, which apply from last October, were further enhanced following the implementation of the recent budget increases in April. The effect of these changes is that it is now easier for farmers to qualify for support under the scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the level of uptake to date, it should be borne in mind that the numbers receiving smallholder's UA had for various reasons declined from 9,900 in 1995 to 6,600 in 1998, that is, by more than 1,000 per year. As it seems likely that this decline would have continued, the 8,000 now receiving payment reflects a significant reversal of the trend in numbers who benefit from support. The scheme clearly makes a valuable contribution to supporting those at the lower end of the farm income spectrum, particularly those with children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the initial uptake of farm assist was particularly slow? We understand the need to be careful with the details of people's income and so forth but part of the reason people refrain from taking up farm assist is the complications involved in applying. It is in the interest of farmers to apply for the scheme but they are prevented from doing so by the amount of red tape. Although farmers would prefer not to be on farm assist, the difficulties this year have led to many experiencing the treadmill of applying for it. They are finding it so difficult that they are asking the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to consider alternatives that would ensure quick release of assistance to those in desperate trouble. They cannot sell their animals and have no income but are finding it almost impossible to receive farm assist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that uptake of the scheme was slow. This is one of the reasons we went to great trouble to advertise it and exhort farmers to apply. Farm assist yielded an average increase of £28 per week for farmers, compared to smallholder's UA, a substantial increase. The money spent on the scheme has increased from £30 million in 1999 to approximately £40 million this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to red tape, it is no different from that which applied to smallholder's UA. It might be the case that some farmers who are not used to claiming social welfare are reluctant to give figures but these are the figures they would have to give in relation to their income tax returns. I have implemented the changes requested under the PPF. The farmers' assocations asked for changes in the farm assist scheme which were implemented in the first budget under the PPF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the difficulties this year, particularly with foot and mouth disease, will the Minister give a commitment that he will discuss the matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to see if an interim measure can be implemented to get people back on their feet or keep them on their feet? It has been suggested that it might be made easier for people to get onto the farm assist scheme. Even if it were reviewed in three or six months, it would get them over the hump. Perhaps the Minister would discuss the concept of a soft loan with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>The people to whom I am referring do not want to be on farm assist but are suffering due to the current difficulties with foot and mouth disease. The Minister's county has experienced these difficulties. My constituency is involved mainly in beef and sheep production. As the marts are not open, people cannot secure an income. We need to address the immediate problem of farm incomes but I do not know what support is available for farmers to get through the red tape of providing all their details.</P>

        <i> (Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Why was there a slow uptake, given that the scheme was introduced to rescue farmers on low incomes? Why is it still not being taken up in view of the dire problems in farming? Is it more than red tape? What about the commitments given about basic income being ignored in the case of BSE and so forth? Is there something wrong with the administration of the scheme? What is the net increase in the number of farmers on the scheme, excluding those who were on smallholder's UA, lone parent's payments and so forth? Many of them switched over from other schemes.</P>

      <P>There is an element of red tape in all social welfare schemes. Obviously, an official will have to examine the applicant's situation before they decide a claim. In relation to the foot and mouth problem, changes were made in the assessment because of the difficulties farmers were experiencing. However, as I explained to the farming organisations when the scheme was originally negotiated, the social welfare system will never replace farm income. Every scheme in social welfare is a safety net for those who fall below a certain level of income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means, whether in cash or in kind, and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who arrived since 10 April 2000. They are provided with full board accommodation, including all meals and other services, under the system of direct provision operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments are made by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have established a working group comprising representatives from relevant Departments to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. The terms of reference of the working <Col N="110" /> group are to review the existing arrangements for the payment of basic weekly supplementary welfare allowance to those who have means other than cash to partly meet their basic needs; to review the circumstances in which those claiming supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement are refused on the grounds that they are not in need of accommodation; to consult with interested parties and to make appropriate recommendations.</P>
    <P>Membership of the working group consists of nominees of the health boards, the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in addition to representatives of my Department, which is chairing the group. I understand the group will report its findings and recommendations to me shortly. With regard to asylum seekers who entered the country before the introduction of direct provision in April 2000, they will continue to receive full rate basic supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplements as appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe it is acceptable that asylum seekers in this State awaiting determination of their applications are in receipt of a weekly payment based upon a payment provided to people in institutional care, a fact which was admitted at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs? Does he accept that by excluding from SWA asylum seekers who arrived here after the date outlined, he is in breach of the Social Welfare Act, 1993, which obliges the State to cover everyone, including refugees and asylum seekers, in order that people may be provided with a sufficiency of means to meet their needs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that asylum seekers are excluded from receiving SWA. They are in receipt of SWA. Account is taken of the fact that such people are in receipt of full board and accommodation. The yardstick used by officials in determining the amount of add-on money for normal requisites was based on other analogous situations such as that referred to by the Deputy. Arising from public comment and representations to the Department on this matter, I decided to establish a working group to consider this issue which is new territory for us. I remind the Deputy that all asylum seekers with families are entitled to very substantial child benefit payments, which from next month will incorporate the increases provided in the recent budget.</P>

      <P>I understand that since the introduction of the direct provision, at least 500 minors have entered the State, many of whom are attending school full time. Given the constant proclamations of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on ongoing labour shortages, even in light of the revised downward growth rates, does the Minister intend to consider allowing people awaiting determination of their applications to work in the economy? Some 18,000 work permits have been issued this year to date and many other asylum seekers are also very anxious to work. In light of the overall level of social welfare provision and the work of the current benchmarking committee, income levels are appalling in many respects but £15 is a derisory amount.</P>

I do not have the exact figure in regard to SWA payments for asylum seekers but, combined with the costs incurred by taxpayers in regard to the provision of accommodation, the overall costs in this area, which were not in the system three or four years ago, are significant.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>Work is well in hand in the Department to effect a smooth changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002. Customers receiving payments by order books will have books spanning the change-over period well in advance of the change. Euro orders for pay-days in January 2002 and onwards are contained in the new child benefit payment books issuing at present and will also be included in the main annual renewal of child benefit books to issue in June. Euro orders will also be included in payment books to issue to one parent families and recipients of the widows' pension in August next and to other categories of pensioners in October.</P>
      <P>Customers receiving their payments by cheque, direct credit to bank and other accounts or on presenting their social services card at their local post office will be paid in euros on their first pay-day in 2002. Payments to customers up to and including 31 December 2001 will, of course, continue to issue in Irish pounds.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the euro changeover should not be confused with issues that relate to the alignment of the tax and calendar years from 1 January next. Consequent on that decision, the Government has also decided that, next year, social welfare increases will take effect from the beginning of January. Budget 2002, which will be announced on 5 December 2001, will provide for these increases.</P>
      <P>Every effort will be made to ensure that increases are paid by or close to the beginning of January. In some cases, because of the timescales involved in the production of certain payments and books, it will not be possible for increases to be paid in all cases in January. This has nothing to do with the euro changeover but is solely due to timing considerations. In cases, however, where there is delay in implementing the increase, all arrears due will be paid at the latest by mid-February 2002, effective from the beginning of January.</P>
      <P>In the current year the effective payment date for budget increases was brought forward significantly to April. This meant that for the first time, social welfare increases came into effect at the same time as the changes in the income tax provisions announced in the annual budget. The position in 2002 will improve even further with the increases effective from January, a full three months earlier than this year, at an estimated cost of £80 million.</P>

      <P>The Minister cleverly attempted to distinguish between the introduction of the euro and payment increases. We do not yet know whether the Taoiseach will opt for the late Sep<Col N="113" /> tember or early October window of opportunity. Some people hold the view that the Minister will cut and run because he is afraid to face the early months of the euro. We were devastated to learn at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs that there will be a significant gap of weeks, if not months, in which social welfare recipients will not receive their due increases. That is grossly unfair. We would be foolish not to expect rip-off merchants and unscrupulous business people in many areas of the economy to jack up prices when the euro is introduced.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate - School Staffing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us should be surprised at the crisis that has arisen in the primary school sector in respect of providing enough teachers to teach in our schools. The situation has reached epidemic proportions over the last 12 months and schools in disadvantaged areas are now crying out for teachers. This should become the priority issue for the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the recruitment problem in schools was signposted as a major difficulty ten years ago, almost no work has taken place in the Department of Education and Science to respond to this crisis. The increasing intake of students into the primary sector over the last ten years has not been met with a radical increase in the number of primary school teachers coming into the school system. We have not learned the lesson of considerable demographic change that has occurred in recent years. This issue can no longer be ignored and I call on the Minister for Education and Science to take an initiative and stem the haemorrhage of teachers from schools.</P>
      <P>School principals, boards of management and teacher representatives want action from the Government to ensure that every child's right to a basic education can be vindicated. The following example of a school in a disadvantaged community highlights the extent of the problem. St. Thomas's school in Jobstown, Tallaght, has a total teacher allocation of 32 full-time teachers. Despite this allocation, the school has been unable to attract a full complement of teachers in each of the past three years. There are currently 25 qualified teachers, five untrained teachers and two unfilled positions in the school.</P>
      <P>Since Christmas, it has advertised for teachers on two separate occasions without receiving even one reply. Since February 1999, 23 qualified teachers have left the school to move to other schools or to change their profession entirely. The experience of this school is not dissimilar to many other schools in what can be described as disadvantaged communities. I accept that the problem of attracting and keeping primary school teachers in schools is not exclusive to communities where there is a high ratio of low income families. However, regardless of whether a school is in a disadvantaged area, it is not acceptable that unqualified substitute teachers can represent an increasing proportion of the total teaching staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special package of measures should be introduced for teachers who are working in some of the most deprived communities in the country. Specifically, I call on the Department of Education and Science to provide a special allowance for teachers who teach in disadvantaged communities. This principle is already established in <Col N="117" /> respect of the island allowance, which is a designated financial incentive to teachers who teach on our islands. If a special case can be made for island communities, it should be also made for disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The Department should give some recognition to teachers who continue teaching in a disadvantaged school for a continuous five year period. I would not oppose a measure that would give such teachers half a year's unpaid leave as a way of recognising the huge pressures they face in their daily work. Teachers in these and other communities frequently act as tutor, parent, social worker and adviser and their role must be recognised.</P>
    <P>The Department must show more flexibility in the application of general rules to schools in disadvantaged communities. The status of a disadvantaged school is now spread so thinly on the ground that it is impossible to indicate any improvement in resources. Has the special committee on schools in disadvantaged communities, as set out in the Education Act, been established by the Department? It is time to recognise that the exodus of teachers who work in schools in deprived communities should be responded to in the form of a Government initiative. This problem will not go away and some of the proposals I have outlined could help in the ongoing battle to staff schools with well qualified and motivated school teachers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House my Department's current position regarding the matters outlined above. The Minister is aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers in the current school year. This has arisen because of two main factors. First, the Government has increased demand for teachers generally by creating extra posts to reduce the pupil/teacher ratios and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage. Since taking office this Government has created an extra 2,315 teaching posts. The creation of these posts has exacerbated the supply situation. Second, the number of trained teachers graduating from our training colleges had fallen to a very low level, for example, only 291 graduated in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate these difficulties. The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further post graduate course commenced in February this year with an intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the <Col N="118" /> current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 academic years. In addition, negotiations are taking place with the colleges of education for the provision of a further postgraduate course next year. The intake to them will be reviewed on an ongoing basis taking account of enrolment trends and changes in demand requirements.</P>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B. Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish Language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. They now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years, from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers. Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the NCEA, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. Other factors exacerbating the shortage at present are the introduction of the early retirement scheme under the PCW agreement and the availability of career breaks and job-sharing to teachers.</P>
    <P>Primary teachers are employed by the boards of management of schools. As employers, boards have the authority to refuse teachers career breaks or job-sharing to teachers in their schools if they wish. There are currently 950 teachers on career break.</P>
    <P>With regard to the high turnover of teachers in schools designated as disadvantaged, the difficulties with teacher shortage and teacher movement are not confined to disadvantaged schools alone. There is no firm evidence to indicate that the <Col N="119" /> problem of obtaining fully qualified teachers in primary schools is confined to areas classified as disadvantaged alone. I am confident that the measures that the Government has taken as outlined will help to ensure that the current difficulties being experienced by schools will be resolved.</P>

Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil chomh maith leis an mBord Bainistíochta &ndash; na tuismitheoirí, na múinteoirí agus le fuireann uilig na gaelscoile i gCluain Meala as ucht an tsár-oibre atá déanta acu le seacht mbliana anuas. Bunaíodh an ghaelscoil i gCluain Meala i 1994 agus fuair an scoil aitheantas sealadach ansin. I 1996 fuair an ghaelscoil aitheantas buan.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the Gaelscoil in Clonmel was established and received provisional approval from the Department of Education and Science. At that time there were two teachers and 38 children in the school. In 1996 permanent recognition was granted by the Department. Today, seven years after the founding of the school, there are 13 teachers, including a remedial and resource teacher, and 241 pupils. The school includes a naoínra, infants and the general classes from first to sixth. There is a waiting list up to 2006 for students who have applied to the school and there are already 75 applicants for the year commencing September 2002. The school can only take 25 children which means there will be 50 disappointed students and families.</P>
      <P>In 1994, when the Gaelscoil was founded, temporary accommodation was found through South Tipperary County Council in the old council buildings and engineering offices in Irishtown and Clonmel. Everybody accepted that would be a short-term arrangement but the school is still there seven years later. The building is totally inadequate and unsuitable, especially for a school of this size. I have experience of the building as I worked there for a number of years with South Tipperary County Council. Unfortunately, since the school was given permanent recognition in 1996 there has been no attempt by the Department to buy a site or build a new school.</P>
      <P>The rooms in the school are very small and the yard is too small to cater for the number of students. The roof is unsafe. Is the Minister aware that the INTO has served strike notice through its general secretary, Senator O'Toole, for a one day strike on 7 June? This is because of the totally unsuitable conditions for both staff and students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate when the Department is to identify and purchase a site for the school? It should be done as quickly as possible, certainly within the next few months. There is much concern that the Department may be attempting, even today, to enter into a further <Col N="120" /> long-term lease with South Tipperary County Council almost over the heads of the members of the board. That would be totally unsuitable and unacceptable to the school.</P>
    <P>When will the Minister agree to meet a deputation from the school together with Oireachtas Members from the county? In this regard I wrote to the Minister on 5 April but have only received the usual official wallpapering replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Healy as ucht an ábhair seo a ardú inniu agus aontaím leis go bhfuil sár-obair déanta ag an scoil seo le blianta beaga anuas. Mar adúirt sé ba sa bhliain 1996 a fuair an scoil aitheantas buan. Glacaim leis go bhfuil an scoil in áit nach bhfuil in oiriúint go fad téarmach. That school is based in a premises rented by South Tipperary County Council and the short-term lease arrangement in existence is one to which the Department is not a party.</P>
      <P>At present the school has a staffing level of a principal and nine assistants and a shared remedial teacher. The school's enrolment was 241 pupils in September 2000. The school authorities have applied to the Department for grant assistance towards the repair work of the existing building, which I presume is giving rise to the difficulties outlined by Deputy Healy, and, in the long-term, for the provision of a new school building. It is the Department's long-term aim to provide permanent accommodation for the school agus is dócha go bhfuil an t-eolas ag an scoil gur mian leis an Roinn áit buan a fháil.</P>
      <P>The Department aims to acquire a site and construct a new school but, in view of the large number schools building projects currently being dealt with, it is not possible at this point to provide a time scale as to when that will happen. Pending the acquisition of a site and the construction of a new school for Gaelscoil Cluain Meala, the Department of Education and Science will consider grant aiding remedial work to the existing building having regard to the terms of the lease arrangements. Deputy Healy raised specific questions regarding the Minister meeting a deputation which I am not in a position to answer, though I will certainly take that message to him and ask him to reply directly to the Deputy.

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this urgent matter. With all due respect to the Minister of State, I am disappointed the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is not here to hear first hand from me, an elected representative from the area, of the staffing crisis at the casualty unit at Longford Hospital. The Minister was in Longford some months ago and has first hand knowledge of how things are there but I want to give a brief picture of the background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people from outside Longford would find <Col N="121" /> it very difficult to understand why a county town, in fact the whole of a county, is without a hospital facility. When the old hospital in Longford was closed, the health care of Longford citizens was transferred to the new hospital and extensions at Mullingar, to what is now known as the Longford Westmeath General Hospital. Extension 2b, the building itself, was finished four years ago and lies idle. Recently on the Order of Business, the Taoiseach was explaining the matter of Stadium Ireland, and I asked about the health services. The Taoiseach rounded on me and referred to the £X billion spent on health and in response I recommended he come to Longford and tell people about the waiting lists, the unfinished hospital in Mullingar and now the crisis of the casualty unit in Longford hospital. Will the Minister of State come to Longford immediately, staff the casualty unit and give people the proper service they deserve as citizens of this State?</P>
    <P>A week ago the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste said there was not a crisis in the health service. I know they have been in Government for four years and that some in power for a while become drunk with it, but the crisis in the health service is fact and 28,000 people are on the waiting lists. The casualty staff in Longford are doing their best but this cannot continue and I appeal to the Minister and the Department of Health and Children. It is no use telling me that it is up to the Midland Health Board as in the final analysis the Minister and his Department are responsible for the welfare of citizens. The people of County Longford deserve more and I will continue this fight on the floor of the House, even if it means my removal by the Ceann Comhairle as threatened in the past. This Government and the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, should climb down off their high horse, forget about Stadium Ireland and look after the people by giving them the health service they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the question of which Deputy Belton gave notice as opposed to all those he raised. I will clarify the matter of staffing at Longford Casualty Unit.</P>
      <P>St. Joseph's Hospital Longford is primarily an in-patient care centre for the elderly with 184 beds. Associated with the hospital is a general practitioner run casualty unit which was extended and upgraded by the Midland Health Board at a cost of £200,0000 last year. Recently the service provided by the unit has had to be curtailed as general practitioners providing cover have withdrawn their services. Prior to this development, the service was staffed by two full-time Midland Health Board general practitioners and seven part-time GPs and it is those seven who have withdrawn their services. As a result the service no longer operates between 9.00 p.m. and 9.00 a.m. from Monday to Thursday as it could not be sustained by the two full-time GPs. The service is otherwise unaffected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Midland Health Board that patient care is not compromised as a <Col N="122" /> result and that, in any event, the more serious cases presenting at St. Joseph's had been referred to Mullingar General Hospital prior to the recent curtailment in the service. While this is an unfortunate development, I understand the GPs in question were concerned the service was being used inappropriately, but I also understand that members of the Midland Health Board management are meeting next Monday night in a bid to resolve the issue. The Department of Health and Children and the health boards are working to develop sustainable out-of-hours general practitioner services in the context of upgrading our primary care services. I am confident this development will continue.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider making similar increases in the area of group sewerage schemes as an increase in the present grant level would considerably improve the lot of those seeking to establish homes and developments on the outskirts of rural towns and villages? In my constituency Newmarket, Kanturk, Boherbue and Kiskeam would benefit greatly from such a move and I urge the Minister to repeat the success he has effected with the group water schemes. The extension of group sewerage schemes is of the utmost importance to the people of Cork North-West and those of other rural communities. At a time of chronic shortage in housing and when the provision of serviced land initiatives is an urgent requirement, such a move would greatly increase the extent of such housing development land on the outskirts of the towns and villages in my constituency and elsewhere. The national committee monitoring rural water has reported to the Minister with proposals to meet the waste water and treatment needs of small rural communities and recommended the establishment of a pilot programme to test a range of new and modern small scale systems which could be used by group sewerage systems outside the immediate catchment area of existing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This move is to be welcomed as it is such action which sets this Government apart in the commitment shown to rural needs. Nevertheless, in recent years we have seen many instances of rural populations declining and small villages dying. However, where an existing sewerage scheme is in operation, by extending the grant from £1,600 to £6,200 it would make it economically viable <Col N="123" /> for people to come together and form a group sewerage scheme. In some areas, like Newmarket, attempts to form a scheme have not been viable because the prohibitive costs set down by the county council specifications have made it impossible for individual houses to come up with the required money. However, because of the prohibitive cost set down by county councils, it is not economically viable for individual houses to come up with the required amount. I call on the Minister to increase the grants available to group sewerage schemes in line with those available to group water schemes.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be present in the House this afternoon and has asked me to respond to the Deputy's Adjournment matter on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Group water schemes have a proven track record as an efficient and cost effective means of meeting the piped water supply needs of rural communities. Almost 6,000 schemes have been completed since the inception of the programme in the early 1960s. The level of group sewerage scheme activity is relatively small compared to group water schemes, with only 150 schemes completed to date. In almost all these cases the group sewerage scheme consists of a wastewater collection system only which, in turn, discharges to a nearby local authority public sewer. Schemes are small, serving an average of six houses. No wastewater treatment or associated effluent or sludge treatment and disposal facilities are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is concerned that small rural communities, such as those outlined by the Deputy, should have appropriate forms of domestic wastewater collection and treatment systems. Such systems should provide cost-effective and sus<Col N="124" /> tainable wastewater treatment processes as well as associated sewers and drains. Given that the planning, construction and subsequent operation of these systems is far more challenging and complex than the type of infrastructure previously developed by group sewerage schemes, the Minister asked the national rural water monitoring committee to examine new approaches to the provision and operation of small scale rural sewerage systems. The committee's report, which was submitted to the Minister in February, recommends a pilot programme to test a range of new, small scale collection and treatment systems for use in rural communities. These systems should be procured by way of a design, build and operate contract. While the ownership of the completed scheme will be vested in the local authority, the contractor will be required to operate the plant over a 20 year period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted the committee's recommendation and tender documents for the proposed pilot programme are being prepared. The Minister will announce details of the pilot programme in due course. Subject to a satisfactory outcome of the pilot testing, the report envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside the immediate catchment of the new treatment systems. However, any review of the level of capital grants, such as those sought by the Deputy, for group sewerage schemes will have to await the outcome of the pilot study.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the steps taken by him to alert older members of the public to possible entitlement to a pension based on pre-1953 contributions or a mix of pre- and post-1953 contributions.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I introduced a special old age contributory pension, payable from 5 May 2000, for people with pre-1953 contributions who might otherwise qualify for no pension or only for a reduced pension. Under these arrangements people who commenced insurable employment before 1953 and who had at least five years paid insurance comprising either pre-1953 contributions or a combination of pre- and post-1953 contributions can now qualify. The pension payable amounts to 50% of the maximum weekly personal rate of pension, that is, £53 from April 2001. Increases for adults and child dependants, where applicable, are also payable at 50%.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction, a total of some 17,000 applications have been received from people not previously in receipt of a pension from my Department, of which 7,700 have now been decided. Of these, some 5,400 people have been awarded a pre-1953 pension. In addition, a further 8,500 pre-1953 pensions have been awarded to people already in receipt of a pro-rata old age (contributory) or retirement pension at a lower weekly personal rate, bringing the total in receipt of the pre-1953 pension to over 13,000. All of the pensions have been paid retrospective to 5 May 2000.</P>
      <P>The pre-1953 pension was advertised in both the national and regional newspapers during the week commencing 25 June 2000. A freephone service was provided in the two weeks following advertising to assist the public with inquiries relating to the new pension. This attracted an estimated 3,500 phone calls. In addition, there was a considerable level of media coverage of the scheme over recent months. Information on the pre-1953 pension is now incorporated in general information on pensions provided by my Department at both national and local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of those now getting this payment is far greater than my Department had anticipated initially. Originally we had expected that some 3,000 people would benefit from this improvement and I am delighted that over four times that estimate are now actually getting the payment. The Department will be undertaking specific projects in the information area over the coming months in which information on the pre-<Col N="126" /> 1953 pensions will be included and the question of further specific initiatives targeted at categories who may have an entitlement to the scheme and have not yet applied is also under consideration.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was launched in April 1997. The overall target, as revised in 1999, is to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor from 9%-15% of the population to less than 5% by 2004 and we are well on our way to achieving this target.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, we committed ourselves to revising and reviewing the national anti-poverty strategy. The methodology underlying the strategy will be reviewed, existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate and new targets will be considered under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people, housing-accommodation and ethnic groups. Indicators will be considered under the national anti-poverty strategy themes so that achievement of targets can be monitored over time.</P>
      <P>A number of working groups, with social partner representation, have been established to facilitate the review of targets, the development of indicators and policies to meet targets. The areas being covered are housing-accommodation, health, employment-unemployment, education, rural poverty and urban disadvantage. Each of the working groups will hold at least one consultative seminar in May or June and will also take account of submissions received on foot of an advertisement placed in national newspapers on 13 February. A separate working group has been established, with an independent chairperson, to examine the issues in relation to benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. The final report of this group is expected in July.</P>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy review working groups are due to report in June. This will be followed by a completion process involving a steering committee with representation from the working groups, including the social partners and a national seminar on the strategy.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the review of the national anti-poverty strategy will be completed in November 2001 and I am confident that the new strategy will provide the basis for further progress towards our goal of effectively eradicating poverty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The national action plan against poverty and social exclusion which is to be submitted to the European Union is a priority for this Government. It represents the policy directions we are committed to pursuing over the period July 2001 to end June 2003 and complements the progress being made in the national anti-poverty strategy review.</P>
      <P>An outline format for the national action plans was agreed by the EU Social Protection Committee on 19 January. A seminar with officials from the relevant services of the EU Commission was held in Brussels on 28 March. The purpose of the seminar was to have an open exchange of information and debate with relevant stakeholders in Ireland  &ndash; including the social partners and Government agencies such as the Equality Authority and the Economic and Social Research Institute &ndash; about the process of co-ordination on social inclusion and the preparation of the national action plans. A round table held in May by my Department updated the social partners and other stakeholders on developments in relation to the preparation of the plan as well as allowing an opportunity to discuss equality issues.</P>
      <P>The processes for consultation already in place for the national anti-poverty strategy and its review were helpful in drafting the plan. Written submissions from a range of interested parties were considered as part of the national plan process. Departments submitted workplans for the period 2001-03 and examples of best practice to the national anti-poverty strategy unit. The Combat Poverty Agency also had a key role in drafting elements of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A draft of the plan has been considered by relevant stakeholders, including the social partners, before submission to Government shortly. While I do not wish to pre-empt the Government deliberations in relation to the plan, I will say that it provides an extensive overview of policies and programmes in relation to social inclusion to be progressed over the next two years under each of the headings agreed by the EU and each of the objectives agreed at the Nice Summit. The plan <Col N="128" /> builds on the extensive range of social inclusion measures already in place. In addition to measures under the NAPS themes, the plan pays particular attention to new areas such as the digital divide, indebtedness and family solidarity.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable to one of a child's parents under legislation which prioritises the right of a mother or step-mother to payment. The long birth certificate is required as verification of the child's birth and to identify the child's parents with a view to determining the entitlement of the person making the claim to receive payment.</P>
      <P>The long form of the birth certificate provides complete and accurate data on an individual's unique identity which can be used for subsequent dealings with the public service.</P>
      <P>I am aware that difficulties may arise from time to time in meeting these requirements and in these instances alternative proofs will be accepted as long as the fundamental identity and relationship requirements are satisfactorily met.</P>
      <P>The modernisation of the civil registration system currently under way means that in the future it will be possible for the Department to receive on-line details of births and this would eliminate the need for obtaining birth certificates in these cases.</P>

      <P>The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services by my Department. My priority is to ensure that people are fully aware of their entitlements and are advised and assisted when the need arises to avail of the schemes and supports available. Information officers are available in all of my Department's local offices and the Department uses a wide range of means to <Col N="129" /> get information or services and changes in those services across to people.</P>
      <P>My Department also funds Comhairle, the national support agency established last year for the provision of information, advice and advocacy services to members of the public including people with disabilities. Funding for this year amounts to £9.75 million.</P>
      <P>Comhairle supports the provision of information and advice on the broad range of social services via the national network of citizens information centres. These centres are operated by local committees and they vary from centres operating on a full-time basis to centres which open on a part-time basis only. The centres employ staff on either a full-time or part-time basis, sometimes under the community employment or similar scheme, and also rely extensively on volunteers. There are 35 centres throughout the country at present which operate on a full-time basis. The employment of staff and the management of the centres are matters for the management committees.</P>
      <P>The citizens information centres provide a very valuable service to people and I would like to see the centres further developed. Comhairle will be examining this issue in the context of its work going forward, including the question of appropriate supports for the centres in the future and the question of continuing support through the community employment and social economy programme will be examined in that context.  </P>
      <P>My Department also provides grants to a number of other organisations under the scheme of grants for the development and promotion of welfare rights. This year I have provided a grant of £190,000 to the Coolock Community Law Centre for the provision of information to the local community.</P>
      <P>I have also approved grants of £112,000 to the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed and almost £89,000 to the ICTU Centres for the Unemployed to assist their welfare rights and information services. I see those organisations also as complementing the work of my own Department in ensuring greater access to relevant information across all sectors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Under my Department's employment support services there is a range of schemes which are designed to assist and encourage the long-term unemployed and other welfare recipients who are experiencing difficulties in accessing employment or getting back to the active workforce, to return to work, training or further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also actively co-operates with other relevant agencies in seeking to assist in the reintegration of people into employment. The back to work allowance scheme is designed to <Col N="131" /> encourage long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment. People in receipt of disability allowance, blind person's pension, invalidity pension and unemployability supplement can access this scheme and, to date, over 850 of them have returned to the workforce in this way.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is currently preparing a pilot scheme targeted at those who have been in receipt of disability benefit for more than five years. Some 200 places on the back to work allowance scheme are being set aside for this specific group.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the difficulties which ex-prisoners and substance misusers can face when attempting to get a foothold in the workforce. In order to assist ex-prisoners to reintegrate into the community, periods spent in prison can be taken into account in order to facilitate access to the back to work allowance scheme. The back to work allowance scheme has been highly successful since its introduction and to date over 80,000 people, the vast majority of whom were previously long-term unemployed, have taken part in the scheme. Currently there are over 37,000 participants in the scheme, approximately half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self-employment options.</P>
    <P>The second pillar of my Department's employment support service is the back to education allowance programme. This is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the workforce. Courses covered under the scheme range from second level through to third level postgraduate courses of study.</P>
    <P>In cases where a person's choice of course falls outside the realm of formal second and third level courses for which the back to education allowance is payable, there are provisions to allow disabled people with disabilities and others to attend approved courses of education, training and development. Participants on these courses may continue to receive their social welfare payments for the duration of the course. In order to assist ex-prisoners who may wish to enter or re-enter the education system, periods spent in prison can be taken into account to satisfy the eligibility criteria for this scheme.</P>
    <P>The final pillar of the employment support service consists of the Department's locally based jobs facilitators. Their primary role is to assist the long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare dependants back to work, training or further education by providing them on an individual basis with assistance to access the necessary programmes or supports which their circumstances demand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> The Department's employment support programmes and other supports for people seeking to get back to the workforce are kept under review in the light of emerging needs and of the range of supports and interventions available through other State agencies for the categories of people involved.</P>

The average number of weeks to decide a claim in the case of unmarried claimants was seven weeks in 1998, 8.6 weeks in 1999 and ten weeks in 2000.</P>
      <P>The time taken to process individual claims varies significantly having regard to the difficulty or otherwise in establishing the circumstances in each case. It should be noted, however, that a large majority of applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payment will normally continue until entitlement to one-parent family payment is determined.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to process applications as quickly as possible and to minimise the time during which applicants receive these alternative forms of support. It is intended to devolve the administration of the one-parent family payment to the Department's network of local offices around the country. This will assist in reducing claim processing times, through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network. Plans for localisation of the scheme are being drawn up and a localisation pilot project in one local office has commenced.</P>
      <P>In the case of free schemes the average time to award an electricity allowance or a telephone allowance was 4.8 weeks in 1998, 3.7 weeks in 1999 and 5.6 weeks in 2000. The scope of the free schemes has been greatly extended in the last two budgets. In 2000 the Government extended free scheme entitlement to all persons over 75 and, in 2001, to all persons over 70. It is expected as a result that an additional 80,000 claims will be processed this year, almost doubling the normal annual new claim intake.</P>
      <P>An increase of this order in the level of new claims inevitably impacts to some degree on the normal claims turnaround. Additional staff and overtime resources have been applied by the Department to deal with the extra work volumes in 2000 and further resources are being assigned to deal with the extra claim intake in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course, my Department would expect to process 70% of claims to the schemes <Col N="133" /> in question in seven weeks. With the assignment of additional staff, normal response rates will be restored over the next few months. I assure the Deputy that every effort is made to process all claims as quickly as possible and that any delay will not result in a loss of entitlements to the people concerned.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, the White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector was published in September 2000. The publication of the White Paper marked a fundamental change in attitudes to the provision of support for community and voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>The White Paper provides for the establishment of an implementation and advisory group consisting of representatives from both the community and voluntary sector and the statutory sector. This group will be co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Health and Children. The implementation and advisory group will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the decisions contained in the White Paper and will identify any unresolved issues arising in a national context. This group will be of enormous assistance in driving the White Paper forward.</P>
      <P>At present, the community and voluntary sectors are involved in a process to select their representatives to the implementation and advisory group. My Department is providing assistance, including financial, to the community and voluntary sector to ensure appropriate representational structures from that sector. The Deputy may be aware that the sector has agreed on an appropriate process and placed two sets of advertisements in national newspapers &ndash; on Friday, 6 April 2001 and Thursday, 10 May 2001 &ndash; in this regard.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the speedy nomination of the representatives from the voluntary and community sector to the implementation and advisory group so that the group can begin its important work in ensuring the White Paper proposals are implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>There are many different types of individualisation and the cost involved depends on the method and extent of individualisation implemented. The working group examining the treatment of married, co-habiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes looked at a number of options which range from making payment directly to a qualified adult, setting the QAA rate at the same level as the personal rate, total independent treatment in payment and means testing arrangements and unconditional payment to those without an independent income. While the first mentioned would involve significant additional administration costs, depending on the option chosen others could cost from £200 million to over £1 billion per annum.</P>
      <P>The group considered the social insurance system to be the most suitable vehicle for expanding the system of individual rights and entitlements. This would be in keeping with the policies of successive Governments which have sought to expand social insurance coverage so that more people could establish their own individual entitlements. At this stage we have a fairly comprehensive social insurance system with almost all workers and self-employed people contributing.</P>
      <P>The expansion of the existing arrangements for separate payments was also recommended so that the qualified adult allowance could be paid direct to a spouse or partner on a more general basis. This system, known as administrative individualisation, is at present being examined by a working group, chaired by my Department, set up under the PPF. The PPF envisages individualisation being progressed in the context of joint assessment of means.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001 I gave a commitment to increase the level of the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age to the maximum rate of the old age non contributory pension. Proposals in relation to administrative individualisation will enhance this initiative by facilitating the payment of the increased qualified adult allowance direct to the person involved.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the Community Welfare Service in the health boards. An interdepartmental working group is currently reviewing the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations.</P>
      <P>The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme are being examined. The review also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and the health boards' Community Welfare Service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the review is now nearing completion. This involved an examination of the objectives of the scheme and included a widespread consultation process. A total of 145 submissions were received from users of the supplementary welfare allowance service, information providers and other interested parties including the social partners, the health boards who administer the scheme and the trade unions representing community welfare officers.</P>
      <P>These submissions are currently being considered and will inform the deliberations of the interdepartmental working group.</P>
      <P>A further meeting of the working group is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, 13 June. I expect the proposals of the group will be finalised by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>At £850 million, the package of social welfare improvements for 2001 is the biggest ever and more than double last year's welfare package. This allocation will, to an unprecedented extent, direct the resources of the State at the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the most significant of these improvements are: £10 a week increase for single old age pensioners; up to £25 a week increase for pensioner couples aged 66 years and over; £12.90 per week special increase for contributory widows and widowers over 66 years; £8 general increase in the weekly social welfare rates; and £25 and £30 increases in monthly child benefit for the lower and higher rates, respectively, with <Col N="136" /> increases to be paid three months earlier from June next.</P>
    <P>The £10 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 10.4% and 11.7% while the £8 general increase represents an increase ranging between 9% and 10.5%. In addition, qualified adult allowances were increased by between 13% and 20%, and child benefit will be increased by over 50% from next June.</P>
    <P>The annual average increase in the consumer price index is the benchmark against which increases in social welfare payments have normally been compared. At budget time an average CPI increase of 4.5% was forecast for 2001. While the latest published monthly CSO report on the consumer price index highlights that in the 12 months to April 2001 inflation increased by 5.6%, it is predicted that this figure will moderate during the second half of the year as external factors, such as the rise in oil prices and the fall in the euro, which pushed up the inflation rate last year, pass out of the index. On the bases of current consumer price index information, therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the payment improvements in 2001 will turn out to be substantial real increases as intended.</P>
    <P>The significant social welfare improvements which we have already made amount to over £1.8 billion since we came into office. These together with the further improvements to which we are committed over the coming years demonstrate our guarantee that everyone will share in the benefits of social and economic developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is strongly committed to eliminating poverty for all our people, including Travellers. My Department has been at the forefront in developing measures to ensure that the needs of Travellers and other ethnic groups are taken into account both in terms of policy development and service delivery.</P>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, co-ordinated by my Department, is underpinned by a number of principles which include ensuring equal access and participation for all and guaranteeing the rights of minorities, especially through anti-discrimination measures. The strategy recognises that Travellers have a high risk of poverty and identifies the need for specific strategies and targets in relation to the employment of Travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it is a primary objective of the strategy to ensure that all Traveller children of primary school age will be enrolled and will participate fully in primary education within five years and that within ten years of the launch of <Col N="137" /> the strategy, all Traveller children of second-level school-going age will complete junior cycle and 50% will complete senior cycle.</P>
    <P>Issues of concern to minority ethnic groups &ndash; including Travellers &ndash; are being considered in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As part of the review, existing national anti-poverty strategy targets will be revised as appropriate and consideration will be given to possible new targets under the themes of women's poverty, child poverty, older people, minority ethnic groups, health, and housing/accommodation. Working groups have been established, with representation from the social partners, towards this end and are due to report by end June. Following a completion process, the outcome of the review will be available later this year.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness identifies that the review of the strategy will address merging causes of poverty such as racism. The programme includes a range of commitments relevant to Travellers and racism in general, including a co-ordinated data strategy with specific reference to Travellers, data collection systems for monitoring poverty among Travellers and additional funding for the National Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, which includes a representative of this Department.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to poverty in the Traveller community come under the remit of the current poverty proofing guidelines, which are incorporated into Cabinet procedures. The enhanced guidelines on poverty proofing, circulated to all Departments in 1999, featured a worked example which used the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, as a guide to the practical implementation of poverty proofing.</P>
    <P>Meeting the needs of the Traveller community will continue to be a priority for my Department, and indeed for this Government, in the fight against social exclusion.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for Finance to Question No. 87 on 3 April 2001. In his reply, the Minister stated that all Departments were asked to review their programmes in the light of the most up-to-date information available to them and to identify ways in which spending could be reduced. This course of action was in response to the prospect of overruns on budget day spending <Col N="138" /> levels which arose during the preparation of the 2001 Revised Estimates Volume and which were caused mainly by the measures agreed by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers to deal with BSE.</P>
      <P>In response to the request by the Minister for Finance, my Department identified a number of programme estimates where changes were warranted based on the latest data available on numbers of recipients and the value of their entitlements. These changes did not involve any changes in qualifying conditions or rates of payment. They were purely estimation changes.</P>
      <P>Similar changes to the projections for 2002 were also warranted and made. Being estimation changes, they do not affect my plans for the year.</P>

      <P>It is my objective as Minister to ensure that my Department provides an excellent service to customers and implements the principles of quality customer service which have been endorsed by Government. My Department has taken a range of measures in recent years to improve the service it provides and I am determined that we will continue to make further progress in this area.</P>
      <P>Three years ago I published a customer action plan to outline what we would do to deliver a quality service. Earlier this year we commissioned an independent national survey to assess whether we were delivering on those commitments and to identify areas where improvement is needed.</P>
      <P>The findings of the independent survey, which I launched earlier this week, are in the main very positive and show that overall satisfaction levels with the service remains high. They show that the Department has a strong focus on providing excellent customer service and that customers on the whole acknowledge that. In particular the survey shows that there is recognition of improvements in public office accommodation, our information service and in communication with our customers.</P>
      <P>There are some areas where improvements are needed and we will use the survey findings to help us develop our programmes in these areas. The Customer Action Plan 2001-2004, which I also launched this week, outlines the specific steps we intend to take in this regard over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is committed to providing the highest standard of public office accommodation and through our building programme a good number of new offices have been provided and others have been refurbished. This programme <Col N="139" /> will continue with particular emphasis being placed on privacy and access for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The provision of timely, accurate and comprehensive information is a primary service for my Department. Information is disseminated through a variety of means including leaflets, newsletters, our website, Aertel and freephones at budget time. In each of the Department's public offices there are designated information officers. Staff in the Department's branch offices are also being trained in the provision of information. My Department will continue to support Comhairle, which is funded by the Department, in the provision of advice and information to citizens on the range of social services. Performance standards in the areas of claim processing, telephone response times and correspondence have been developed. The performance standards are monitored on a monthly basis and updated annually. The standards and performance levels achieved are published in the Department's annual reports.</P>
    <P>Staff training is also an area that has received attention and approximately 1,200 front line staff have recently participated in a comprehensive customer service training programme. Staff in other Department offices are now undergoing this training to co-ordinate the delivery of services by different Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>My Department has been involved in a number of major initiatives at central and local level. The setting up of the REACH agency which is developing the framework for the integration of public services using modern technologies, and the joint project involving my Department and the Department of Health and Children to implement a modern Civil Registration Service are key building blocks underpinning the integration of public service delivery and providing more convenient access to information and services for citizens.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 47 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, presented its interim report at the end of April. Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library. The interim report has been distributed to representatives of the pillars of social partnership and the report can also be found on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group are drawn from the PPF and require it to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns; and examine the issue of relative income poverty.</P>
      <P>The interim report identifies the key issues which the group is addressing in seeking to achieve a consensus position on the range of issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of welfare payments, and on the question of indexation or up-rating of these payments. The group is continuing with its work at present and intends to complete its work by the end of July 2001. It will produce its final report shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>Given that the group was specifically established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the issues involved, it will be appreciated that it would be inappropriate for me to seek to pre-empt its findings at this stage. I can assure the Deputies, however, that the most careful account will be taken of the conclusions reached by the group once its work has been completed, both in the immediate context of the 2002 budget and in the wider context of the development of welfare policy generally.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must enter social insurance before age 56, for the old age contributory pension, and age 55 for the retirement pen<Col N="141" /> sion; have a minimum of 156 full rate contributions paid or 260 if the yearly average is less than 20 &ndash; this requirement will, for all contributors, increase to 260 and 520 paid contributions from April 2002 and April 2012, respectively; and have a yearly average of, at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953 &ndash; when the unified system of social insurance came into effect &ndash; or the date of entry into social insurance, if later. A yearly average of 48 contributions is required for a full rate pension.</P>
      <P>In general, all contributions paid or credited, at the appropriate rate, on a person's record are assessed when their entitlement to a pension is being examined. However, only contributions made under the unified social insurance scheme, introduced in 1953, can be used to satisfy the average contributions test. Contributions paid prior to 1953 may only be used to satisfy the first two conditions outlined above.</P>
      <P>While there are no plans to allow pre-1953 contributions to be taken into account for the yearly average test, further recognition was afforded these contributions in budget 2000 with the introduction from May 2000 of a special half rate pension aimed at people with pre-1953 insurance who cannot satisfy the yearly average test.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify a total of 260 contributions, comprising a mixture of pre-1953 and post-1953, is required. This is in line with this Government's commitment to ensuring the widest possible coverage for old age contributory pensions. Other measures taken include a reduction in the average number of contributions required for pension purposes to ten, introduced in 1997, and the provision of special pensions for self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory was introduced for this group.</P>
      <P>Further improvements in the pensions area will be examined on foot of the second phase of the pensions review which I expect to receive later this year.</P>

      <P>The contract under which An Post supplies payment delivery services to my Department reached the end of its term on 31 December 1999. The Government had previously decided that the term of this contract should be extended for a further three years, 2000 to 2002 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain legal issues regarding the extension of the contract have been raised with the EU Commission by a third party. In accordance with its usual practice in these matters, the Commission <Col N="142" /> referred these complaints to my Department for its observations.</P>
    <P>Responses to the complaints, and the complex legal issues upon which they are based, have been sent to the Commission. I understand that the Commission is currently examining the arguments advanced by the complainant and the observations supplied by my Department.</P>
    <P>The necessity to address and resolve the issues raised with the EU Commission has delayed the completion of a new contract with An Post. In the meantime, recognising that the payment delivery services which An Post provides to my Department's customers must continue without interruption, my Department and An Post have agreed that the company will continue to provide these services on an interim basis. The Commission has been notified accordingly.</P>
    <P>I have already reiterated this Government's commitment to maintain a network of post offices. While not wishing to pre-empt the outcome of the issues being considered by the EU Commission, I am confident that An Post will continue to have an important role in the delivery of services for my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to inform the Deputy that substantial progress has been made by my Department over the past four years in implementing the key commitments in both its Action Programme for the Millennium published in 1997 and the revised programme agreed in November 1999.</P>
      <P>Our stated objective is to build an inclusive society where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country. After four years we can point to numerous notable successes in promoting an inclusive society. We have made determined efforts to break cycles of poverty and deprivation and significantly the main national anti-poverty strategy &ndash; NAPS &ndash; goals, with an original target date of 2007, have now been achieved. The overall target, as revised in 1999, is to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor from 9-15% of the population to less than 5% by 2004 and we are well on our way to achieving this target.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, we have committed ourselves to revising and renewing the national anti-poverty strategy in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have recognised the need to deal decisively with the issue of welfare income adequacy. Significant improvements in social welfare schemes amounting to over £1.8 billion have been made <Col N="143" /> over the past four years. Social welfare rates have improved significantly in real terms since we took office and payment dates for budgetary increases in rates have been brought forward each year with the aim of paying them from the start of the tax year in January 2002.</P>
    <P>As part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, we have entered into a number of social inclusion commitments with the social partners. This programme provides that in the period up to 2003, all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 per week for the lower rates of payments. These, together with the further improvements to which we are committed over the coming years demonstrates our guarantee that everyone will share in the benefits of social and economic development.</P>
    <P>A working group has been established under the programme, with an independent chairperson, to examine the issues in relation to benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>In our Government programme we pledged to bring the old age pension levels up to £100 per week by 2002 to ensure that all old age pensions increased in line with average industrial earnings. We are well on line to delivering on these commitments.</P>
    <P>The effect of the increases we have introduced over the past four budgets is that the rate of old age contributory pension of £106 per week currently exceeds the £100 target and the rate of old age non-contributory pension now stands at £95.50 per week. In 1997 the old age contributory pension represented 27.5% of average industrial earnings. We have increased that each year to 31% in line to reach the national pensions initiative target of 34%.</P>
    <P>In our action programme we are strongly committed to improving the position of people who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives. In budget 2001 I announced improvements in the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age which will see this increasing to the full old age pension rate over a number of budgets. A major step towards this objective was taken in budget 2001 by providing an increase of £15 per week in the full qualified adult rate.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the homemaker's scheme, years spent out of the workforce caring for children or incapacitated people may be disregarded when calculating entitlement to old age contributory or retirement pension. The scheme is currently effective from 1994 and a maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way. I am committed in principle to making the existing scheme effective from an earlier date than 1994 and replacing the disregards system with actual credits. These and other issues, including the cost and administrative implications involved, will be considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age <Col N="144" /> contributory and retirement pensions which commenced earlier this year.</P>
    <P>One of our key priorities in the revised programme is to bring forward a programme to effectively address child poverty. Over the past four budgets we have provided substantial improvements in the rates of child benefit and intend to continue to do so in line with our commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness with a priority focus towards £100 per week for the third and subsequent children. The Government is committed to exceeding this by dramatically increasing child benefit by £1 billion over the three years of the programme.</P>
    <P>Following this year's historic increases in budget 2001, the level of child benefit will be more than doubled from £30 per month for the first two children in 1997 to £67.50 from the beginning of June next. This investment of substantial resources to child benefit reflects the serious commitment this Government has made to supporting those who are responsible for raising our children and in tackling child poverty.</P>
    <P>This Government fully recognises the valuable role of carers in our society. We have delivered on our commitments to relax the qualifying criteria for carer's allowance and to increase the value of the payment in real terms. We have introduced a wide range of increases both in terms of income supports and in terms of services provided. This is reflected in the increasing numbers of carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit which have increased since we took up office from 9,200 to 17,300 and also are expected to reach 22,000 as a result of the improvements provided in budget 2001. Expenditure for carers has more than tripled from £36.5 million in 1997 to a projected £113.8 million this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, I initiated a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care at the end of last year. The study will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs both in the community and in institutional care and the potential of the private sector or a combined public-private sector approach to develop new initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium attaches importance to maintaining the position of the family in Ireland as &ldquo;one of our strongest national characteristics&rdquo;. In the first year of our term of office we published the findings of the Commission of the Family. The report is making a positive contribution to developing coherent, progressive and effective policies for families.</P>
    <P>In line with the commission's recommendations, we have established a family affairs unit in my Department and provided significant extra funding to the Family Mediation Service and to marriage and child counselling and family and community centres.</P>
    <P>In our revised programme we promised to establish the Family Mediation Service on a statutory basis and develop a strong regional network of accessible counselling services. The Govern<Col N="145" /> ment has recently approved my proposals for the establishment under legislation of a new agency, the family support and mediation service, which will provide a comprehensive and coherent response for families who have need of support services.</P>
    <P>We have also committed ourselves to establishing 100 family and community centres and to develop local offices to provide family services as recommended by the commission. There are currently some 70 centres either established or approved for funding throughout the country providing locally based community support to families and it is my intention to increase the number to the target set in our programme.</P>
    <P>Pilot family services projects to provide improved information services for families operate on a one-stop shop basis in Cork, Finglas and Waterford. Some £12 million has been provided in the national development plan for the expansion of the projects over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Another key priority in this area relates to lone parents and the need for measures to support them and facilitate their return to the workplace. Last year, I initiated a proactive programme for one-parent family payment recipients to ensure that they are aware of the employment, education and training opportunities available to them. I have also decided to localise the administration of the scheme from the pension services office in Sligo to my Department's local offices. This move will bring lone parents into closer contact on an ongoing basis with the various support services available in the Department's offices and will, therefore be useful in promoting the programmes available to encourage lone parents back into education, training and employment. A pilot scheme has recently been initiated in my Department's Tallaght office.</P>
    <P>In budget 2001 I announced changes to the back to education scheme designed to assist and encourage young lone parents to return to education. Heretofore, the qualifying age for the back to education scheme was set at 21. However, from this autumn the scheme will be available to 18 year olds who have been in receipt of the one-parent family payment for at least six months and who have been out of the education system for two years.</P>
    <P>In 1997 we pledged to reduce the burden of PRSI and levies with a particular emphasis on helping those in low-paid employment. Since then we have reduced the employee rates of PRSI and levies by 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively, and increased the exemption limits so that employees earning less than £226 per week do not pay a PRSI contribution and those earning less than £280 per week do not pay the health contribution.</P>
    <P>Funding is provided under the scheme of grants to locally based community and family support groups. Some 36 women's groups are currently in receipt of three year core funding with £1.3 million committed in 2001.</P>
    <P>We undertook in our action programme to attack fraud and abuse of the social welfare sys<Col N="146" /> tem with the aim of freeing up resources to address real needs. Control savings in 1998, 1999 and 2000 amounted to £176 million, £192 million and £214 million, respectively. Legislation was also introduced in 1998 to improve the flow of information between certain public bodies to improve service and control fraud, by providing for the more widespread use of the PPSN number. It also specifies particular purposes for sharing of information between public bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 40, 58, 162 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. The most recent estimate of the number of full-time carers has been provided by the results of the census pilot survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office. This survey was carried out in September 1999 and is based on a sample of 8,000 households in which persons aged 15 years or over were asked if they provided unpaid personal help for someone with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed results are as follows: 35,000 people provide more than 50 hours unpaid per<Col N="147" /> sonal help per week, or seven hours per day: 17,000 people provide 20-49 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between three and seven hours per day; and 79,000 people provide 1-19 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between nine minutes and 2.5 hours per day.</P>
    <P>These results are consistent with the figure of 50,000 full-time carers as estimated in the review of the carer's allowance. It also explains the estimate of 120,000 carers used by the carer organisations which I have consistently said was due to the definition they were using of carer, as someone who visits or assists a person, but who does not provide full-time care. I have asked the Central Statistics Office to consider using a more detailed breakdown of these hours when conducting the census next year.</P>
    <P>There are more than 17,100 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that almost 33% of the 52,000 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than three hours per day, are in receipt of carer's allowance. This is an increase of over 86% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office and it should also be noted that the expected increase of another 5,000 carers following the recent increases in income disregards will increase this percentage to 42% of all carers who are providing more than three hours care per day.</P>
    <P>This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million next year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
    <P>In budget 2001, in addition to the substantial weekly rate increases of £8 for carers aged under 66 and £10 for carers aged over 66, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the weekly income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. As I have already mentioned, this will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment. The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £25,100 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes and the measures that I have introduced further enhance the qualification criteria for this scheme. As I announced in my budget speech, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation, whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>In excess of 32,200 carer's allowance applications have been received from 197 to date. Of <Col N="148" /> this number, about 10,000 claims for carer's allowance have been refused. In general, the number of refusals may be broken down into the following groups:</P>
    <P>Care need and provision: Approximately 5,300 applications have been refused for reasons relating to the need for or provision of care. As the Deputy will be aware, the term &ldquo;full-time care and attention&rdquo; means that the care recipient is so disabled that he or she requires continual supervision in order to avoid danger to him or herself or continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with his or her normal personal needs, for example, help to walk and get about, eat or drink, wash, bathe, dress, etc.</P>
    <P>In addition, the care recipient must be so disabled as to be likely to require full-time care and attention for a period of at least 12 months. The degree of medical incapacity and the expected duration of the incapacity is certified by a medical doctor. Where applications are refused on these grounds, full-time care is either not required or is not being provided by the carer.</P>
    <P>Means: Approximately 3,200 applications have been refused on the basis that the applicant's means exceed the limits. I have already outlined the significant improvements which I made to the means test in the last budget.</P>
    <P>Other: A total of 1,500 applications have been refused for other miscellaneous reasons. This group includes carers who are in receipt of another, more beneficial social welfare payment, carers who withdraw their application and carers who did not satisfy the residency conditions applying at that time.</P>
    <P>A review of the carer's allowance was carried out and published in 1998. This review considered the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development. It examined a wide range of issues including the payment of carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. In this regard, the review noted that the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual to ensure that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual.</P>
    <P>It examined the purpose of the carer's allowance and concluded that it is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. Therefore, the review concluded that two income support payments should not be made, in line with current practice. Of course, a person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled. The review did propose the introduction of a non-means tested &lsquo;continual care' payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of <Col N="149" /> care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>To differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of the review and its proposals on the improvement and development of the carer's allowance, I introduced a range of measures in the 1999 budget and subsequent budgets to improve and develop the position of carers. Some of these measures are listed as follows: carer's allowance was extended to all carers caring for a person between the age of 16 and 65, regardless of the source of income of the care recipient; carer's allowance was extended to include carers who are caring for a child in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance; a free travel pass, free telephone rental allowance, free electricity or gas allowance and free TV licence was extended to all qualified carers; an annual payment of £400 towards respite care; a double respite care grant of £800 is payable to carers caring for more than one person; the &ldquo;full-time care and attention&rdquo; rule has been relaxed to allow carers in receipt of carer's allowance to take up paid employment for up to ten hours per week; the residency criteria have been relaxed to allow non-resident carers qualify for the allowance; qualified carers are no longer required to satisfy &ldquo;13 paid contribution&rdquo; rule when claiming disability benefit; credited PRSI contributions are available to all qualified carers and carers who have ceased their caring responsibilities are eligible for the back to education allowance and back to work schemes.</P>
    <P>The carer's benefit scheme, which was introduced in October 2000, is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot, and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide <Col N="150" /> adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others. The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, held a plenary session on Monday, 14 May 2001 to discuss the draft report of its project team on lone parents. There is nothing in the draft report to support recent media reports that the risk of poverty for lone parents has increased sixfold since 1981. The data in the report indicate that the poverty risk for lone parent families, that is, the numbers who fall below the 50% income poverty line, increased from 17% in 1987 to 29% in 1994. Recent data indicate that it has remained at that level in 1997. That said, lone parents remain one of the groups in society who are most at risk of poverty. Accordingly, a range of measures has been introduced to improve the overall incomes of lone parents and to deal with their training and education needs.</P>
      <P>The family services project is being piloted in three local offices of my Department &ndash; Cork, covering the Togher and Mahon areas, Finglas in Dublin and Waterford city. The pilot project is part of the Government's families first approach for which some £12 million has been provided for the development of services to my Department this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the family services project is to provide a high quality information service about the range of supports available to families from State agencies and from the community and voluntary sector with a particular emphasis on the services available locally. Within the project an enhanced programme of support is available to a small group of customers with complex needs. The additional support involves individual attention, customised information and access to services and supports which would assist the family <Col N="151" /> to improve their personal circumstances. The focus in the project is on young lone mothers, parents rearing children without the support of a partner and other families in households depending on social welfare payments. To date, the family services project has been well received and is proving to be an effective support for customers and their families. The Government has provided £12 million in the national development plan for the progressive expansion of the successful elements of the pilot programme over the period to 2006.</P>
    <P>In line with Government commitments to make families central to policy making and to tackle poverty, real and very substantial improvements have been made in income support provision for families depending on social welfare payments, and for those at work on low pay.</P>
    <P>Next month will see the start of radical child benefit increases of £25 per month for the first and second child and £30 per month for third and subsequent children amounting to some £330 million in a full year and £1 billion over the next three years. A range of initiatives have been introduced specifically to assist lone parents in accessing education, training and other supports and assist them in their efforts to find a place in the jobs market. It is my intention to continue to introduce measures to improve the position of lone parents and other families relying on social welfare in line with the Government's commitments to develop coherent, progressive and effective policies for families as promised in the Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>In August 2000 I launched the report on phase 1 of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This report identified the key issues in relation to qualification conditions and set out suggested guiding principles and outlines a framework for reform. One of the recommendations involves a change in the qualification conditions from the current one based on average contributions to a system based on the number of contributions paid or credited over a person's working life. This represents a significant change in approach for overall pensions policy. However, such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also recommended that the homemaker's scheme, which is designed to help women who take time out of the paid workforce to care <Col N="152" /> for children or sick relatives to qualify for a pension, be reviewed. Under the scheme the time spent caring since 1994 is disregarded when average contributions are being assessed for pension purposes. A working group comprising officials of my Department and the Department of Finance is undertaking the second phase of this review. It is expected that the phase 2 report will be available for consideration in the context of budget 2002.</P>

      <P>Following the agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. All memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives upon which significant policy decisions have to be made are required to be poverty proofed and this has been the case since late 1998.</P>
      <P>The introduction of poverty proofing of significant policy proposals is a major tool in assisting this Government in halting the drift towards a two-tier society by keeping social inclusion to the fore in policy making at all times. It ensures that Departments are kept aware of the possible implications of policy on those most in need and it is a system this Government is committed to as part of its social inclusion strategy.</P>
      <P>To assist in the implementation of poverty proofing, the national anti-poverty strategy unit, based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing and worked examples which were distributed to all Departments last year.</P>
      <P>The unit has also met with the strategy's liaison officers in all Departments and discussed poverty proofing with them in order to assist with any difficulties. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the poverty proofing arrangements are currently being reviewed by the National Economic and Social Council. The review is examining issues such as how the poverty proofing process might distinguish between large integrated programmes which consist of proposals from various Departments, and other more self-contained proposals. It is also assessing how the on-going implementation of the poverty proofing process might be integrated with the broader policy proofing requirements, including equality proofing, rural proofing and eco-auditing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A draft of the poverty proofing review has been considered by the NESC at its last meeting which was held on 4 May. I expect that the out<Col N="153" /> come of the review, which will be finalised shortly, will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties that may constrain its effective implementation. Following the review, my Department will consider further measures for improving the process, including possibilities for incorporating appropriate training modules into general service training courses.</P>
    <P>The Programme of Prosperity and Fairness also envisages the extension of poverty proofing on a phased basis to a local level through the local authorities and State agencies and this will be considered further following completion of the review.</P>

      <P>Since taking up office, I have introduced a number of improvements in the invalidity pension scheme, including an extension of the back to work allowance and back to education allowance schemes to invalidity pensioners in September 2000 and an extension of the living alone allowance of £6 per week to invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years from the beginning of April 2001. In addition, the weekly rates of payment have been significantly increased during this period. For instance, the weekly rate of payment to an invalidity pensioner aged under 65 has been increased by £19.90 &ndash; a real increase of 13%, while the weekly rate of payment for those aged 65 and over has been increased by £28 &ndash; a real increase of 19%. As part of the expenditure review process, my Department is currently reviewing the range of income maintenance payments to people who are ill and people with disabilities, including the invalidity pension scheme. Notwithstanding the improvements which have been introduced in recent years in this area, it is recognised that the current system is complex and in need of rationalisation.</P>
      <P>This review will, therefore, examine the roles and effectiveness of the range of income maintenance payments provided by my Department and the health boards. While it is not intended hat this review would look at the finer details of each scheme or make recommendations for detailed changes, it will, however, provide a framework within which this more detailed work can be done in the future.</P>
      <P>I expect this review will be completed by the end of the year and any proposals emerging which have financial implications will be examined in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>The decision to localise the administration of the one-parent family payment was taken following the Report of the Expenditure Review of the One-Parent Family Payment which was published in September 2000. It is intended to devolve over time the administration of the one-parent family payment to the Department's network of local offices around the country.</P>
      <P>This is aimed primarily at making the scheme more accessible to recipients of one parent-family payment. It will be of great value in helping them to access information about employment, education and training opportunities in their own area, through my Department's local employment support services. It will also assist in reducing claim processing times through closer linkage with the local investigators and will enhance closer liaison between the community welfare officers and the Department's local offices in regard to one-parent families.</P>
      <P>A working group was set up in my Department to oversee the arrangements that must be put in place to effect the transfer of one-parent family payment claims processing from its current centralised location in the pension services office in Sligo to the Department's network of local offices. As a first step, a pilot project for processing new claims in the Dublin west area started on 2 May 2001 in Tallaght.</P>
      <P>New one-parent family payment claims in this area are now being accepted and decided at local level. This pilot project will help to identify any issues or problems arising from localisation and allow them to be addressed before extending the process to other local offices. The progress of this pilot is being kept under continuous review.</P>
      <P>Pending development of appropriate computer facilities for full local operation of the scheme, payment order books will continue to be issued through the Sligo office for the time being. The new computer facilities will likely be available in early 2002 and this will allow for the extension of localisation of this scheme to all local offices during 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are almost 300 deciding officers working in the sections of my Department dealing with disability benefit, child benefit and one parent family payments. A corresponding figure for 1991 is not available. Over that period, there have been major changes to the underlying conditions attached to the schemes, significant increases in the volume of claims received and changes in work practices and procedures. The staffing needs of the sections concerned are continually monitored in the context of such changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>The number of appeals officers serving in the social welfare appeals office at 31 December 1991 was 13. There were 16 appeals officers at the end of 2000. These appeals officers deal with all types of social welfare appeals, including the schemes referred. The number of appeals officers is kept under review having regard to the work arising in the office. Over the past years the number of appeals has been increasing &ndash;  17,650 appeals were received last year &ndash; and the staffing complement of the office is under consideration at present in that regard.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration. There is an inevitable time-lag in such a process which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>
      <P>In the case of disability benefit appeals, for example, a second medical examination is normally undertaken by a medical assessor of my Department in the context of the appeal and, if this is favourable to the appellant, benefit is immediately restored without the need for recourse to the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The average time taken to process all appeals closed during the year 2000 was just under 21 weeks. This average period includes all phases of appeals, including the additional time involved in the determination of appeals where, for example, further investigations have to be made or where adjournments have been sought by the appellant or by the legal representative acting on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the increase in the number of appeals, average processing times have been broadly maintained during the last four years. While processing times in the social welfare appeals office compare favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of improvements in processing times is a major objective of the office. It is, of course, necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is not in conflict with, or at a cost to, the demands of justice and the require<Col N="156" /> ment that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>
    <P>During this year a management consultancy study will be undertaken on the role, functions and organisation of the social welfare appeals office, including examination of all the processes involved in dealing with claims to the appeals stage. Any procedural improvements which are identified in the course of this examination will be implemented.</P>

      <P>There is a wide variety of State schemes and supports which require means testing to determine the extent of need and the appropriate level of entitlement. The different means tests reflect, in may instances, specific policies aimed at targeting specific needs of particular groups. Progress has been achieved over recent years in streamlining the assessment of means, for example, in the care of capital assessment for social welfare schemes. Major advances in the co-ordination of means tests, however, involves considerable costs.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements in the quality of service delivery to customers of public services are possible through streamlining the processes and procedures which departments and agencies currently use to capture means information. I have concentrated a lot of effort in laying the foundations for greater sharing of information across the Department to assist in the determination of entitlements and to avoid the need for claimants to undergo multiple means assessments in order to access services.</P>
      <P>To fast-track the streamlining of public service delivery, including means assessments, I established the REACH Agency last September with a remit to build the framework for integrating public services. This agency will be responsible for the development of a public service broker which will act as the common gateway to public services and act and provide common services such as identity validation, storing and sharing of data and a secure environment for electronic Government services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the design of the broker is advancing and considerable progress has been made. The reform of the civil registration process which my Department is undertaking jointly with the <Col N="157" /> Department of Health and Children is an intrinsic part of the new infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Part of the broker service will be a customer centred integrated information service known as OASIS developed by Comhairle, which I launched on 26 April. The service, still being developed, is already available to public service providers as well as the public on the internet.</P>
    <P>The REACH programme is a major undertaking that will take a number of years to develop fully and will involve almost all public service agencies. I am confident that when full operational, this programme will transform the situation as far as the response to people accessing state services is concerned.</P>

      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency's proposal was included in a submission which it was invited to make to the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The benchmarking and indexation group comprises representatives of each pillar of social partnership.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of this group require it to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns; and examine the issue of relative income poverty. The complex issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy are currently being considered by this group and the submission prepared by the Combat Poverty Agency represents an important contribution to the groups deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has recently produced an interim report and it is planned that it will complete its deliberations by end July 2001 and produce its final report shortly thereafter. Given the specific remit of the group as set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I do not believe that <Col N="159" /> it would be appropriate for me to seek to pre-empt the group's findings in any way at this time.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the group will be considering the position of those who are in receipt of unemployment payments in the course of its deliberations. It is important to recall in this context that unemployment has reduced dramatically since 1997 and opportunities for employment are now at a level that would have been unthinkable five years ago. The Government's employment action plan has been very successful in reducing the numbers unemployed through the provision of the training, support and guidance needed to enable people to avail of employment opportunities. Notwithstanding that success, the Government remains absolutely committed to tackling the barriers faced by those who continue to have difficulties in re-entering the active labour market.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that the conclusions reached by the group when it presents its final report in a few months time will receive the most careful consideration in the context of the development of future welfare policy and budgetary strategy.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment, of £6.00 per week, to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone.</P>
      <P>It is a recognition of the additional costs incurred by a person living alone due to the absence of economies of scale. At the end of April 2001 there were 91,538 people in receipt of a living alone allowance, 46,039 of whom were widowed people.</P>
      <P>At the end of April 2001 there were 34,880 people aged under 66 in receipt of a widow/er's contributory pension. Approximately 10% of these have qualified children. In addition there were 2,970 people aged under 66 in receipt of a widow/er's non-contributory pension, none of whom would have children. All of the 1,300 widowed people in receipt of one-parent family payment have children.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, there are approximately 34,300 widowed people under 66 years of age who do not have qualified children. It is not possible to determine the number of these who are living alone. However, extending the living alone allowance to the entire group would have a full year cost of approximately £10.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans at present to change or expand the eligibility conditions for the living <Col N="160" /> alone allowance. However, it is worth mentioning that widows in receipt of a contributory pension receive a higher rate of payment and higher child dependant increases than many other welfare recipients. Significant improvements have also been made in the bereavement grant and other after death payments which provide support in the very difficult period after a bereavement.</P>

However, as an example, if the duration of all such claims averaged three months the cost would be in the region of £1.2 million.</P>
      <P>Such costs, necessarily speculative at this stage, are of course not the full costs associated with the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
      <P>Income from PRSI contributions is likely to be affected to some extent. It is also likely that the slower than normal seasonal decline in the live register this year is partly due to the adverse impact of the foot and mouth crisis in the tourism and other sectors.</P>
      <P>However, the indications are that the effect on my Department's budget will be comparatively small and that it will be possible to meet any extra costs without recourse to a Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board's report, Securing Retirement Income, &ndash; on the national pensions policy initiative &ndash; NPPI &ndash; laid down a blueprint for the development of supplementary pensions provision in Ireland. It is a particularly complex and detailed report and the culmination of a lengthy consultation process with all the representatives of the Irish pensions area.</P>
      <P>The Government broadly welcomed the thrust of the proposals and I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's firm commitment to the implementation of the proposals contained in the board's report.</P>
      <P>The Government has already taken action on a number of the main NPPI proposals. The Government has set up a pensions reserve fund to partly offset the future cost of pensions, as recommended by the board. The significant increases in the rate of pensions means that we are making good progress towards the NPPI recommendation that the weekly rate should represent 34% of average industrial earnings. In addition, acting on one of the recommendations in the report, I introduced provisions in the 1999 and 2000 Social Welfare Acts which prohibited reductions in occupational pensions already in payment to pensioners, arising from increases in social welfare pensions. This ensured the full value of the budget increase in the social welfare pension was passed on to pensioners.</P>
      <P>In relation to outstanding NPPI recommendations, it is proposed that the forthcoming pensions Bill will give legislative effect to these proposals. One of the key features of the Bill will be the provision of a legislative framework for the introduction and regulation of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs. As the Deputy will be aware, on 12 April I announced details of the draft legislative framework for PRSAs. PRSAs were recommended by the board as the vehicle to facilitate increased savings for pensions and extend supplementary pensions coverage overall, especially to people who have no such cover at present.</P>
      <P>The Bill will also make provision for a number of other NPPI related matters, namely the pensions board proposals relating to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation. In the context of preparations for the Bill, I am also considering reports from the board in relation to the treatment of scheme surpluses, equal treatment, a pensions ombudsman and a compensation fund.</P>
      <P>I intend to publish the pensions Bill by the end of June this year.</P>

      <P>I expect the Deputy is referring to the document, Poverty and Social Welfare, prepared by the Conference of Religious in Ireland in advance of budget 2001, which criticised the use of the &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo; measure.</P>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy sets out a number of goals to be achieved over a ten year period from 1997 to 2007, including targets on income adequacy. Chief among the strategy's objectives was a reduction in the numbers living in consistent poverty from 9%-15% of the population in 1994 to less than 5%-10% of the population by the year 2007. The latest data available, in respect of 1998, shows that 6%-8% of the population are living in consistent poverty, so we are well on our way to achieving our revised target of below 5% by 2004. There is no single best way to measure poverty. No one method can provide all the answers. The document referred to by the Deputy recognises that income alone does not tell the whole story concerning living standards and command over resources, and that it is necessary to look more broadly at a person's exclusion from the life of society because of lack of resources.</P>
      <P>This is particularly the case in trying to capture trends in poverty in a situation of very rapid growth in average incomes such as we are currently experiencing in this country. Direct measures of deprivation provide a valuable and complementary source of information in measuring poverty and assessing poverty trends. The NAPS poverty target defines consistent poverty as being below 50%-60% of average household income and experiencing enforced basic deprivation. This, as the Deputy will know, is based on independent research by the Economic and Social Research Institute. Eight basic items were identified by the Economic and Social Research Institute in their 1987 household survey, for example, two pairs of strong shoes, a warm waterproof coat etc. These items are selected by the respondents themselves as basic necessities but which they are unable to afford. The Economic and Social Research Institute, supported by my Department, keeps the deprivation index under regular review to ensure that it remains relevant to people's perception of necessities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indicators were most recently examined in relation to the 1998 Living in Ireland Survey and data in relation to 2000 will be available later this year. We have also committed ourselves under the terms of Framework III of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to updating the underlying methodology of the national anti-poverty strategy in consultation with the relevant actors, reviewing the existing targets and considering new targets. In addition, a working group has been established to examine benchmarking and indexation issues and the issue of relative income poverty. This group has <Col N="163" /> produced an interim report and is due to complete its deliberations in July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by the health boards through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Payment is made in accordance with the relevant social welfare legislation as long as the person is resident in the State. Policy guidelines on the administration of the scheme are issued from time to time as necessary.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in principle in September 1998 that asylum seekers were to have their basic needs, including their accommodation needs, met through direct provision. The system of direct provision was introduced by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with effect from 10 April 2000.</P>
      <P>Guidance was issued to the health boards in April 2000 on the implications of the introduction of direct provision for the SWA scheme. That guidance stated that, in general, rent supplements were not payable to asylum seekers who arrived in the State after the introduction of direct provision. This is because it is a long standing statutory requirement for payment of rent supplement that a health board must be &ldquo;satisfied that the claimant is in need of accommodation&rdquo;. With some exceptions, asylum seekers arriving after 10 April 2000 do not meet that requirement as accommodation is now being provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In practice, about 12% of asylum seekers are granted rent supplement on medical or social grounds in cases where direct provision is not a suitable option in their circumstances.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to former asylum seekers is quite different. If an asylum seeker has been granted refugee status or humanitarian leave to remain in the State, then they are entitled to claim and be paid rent supplement in the normal way, subject to the standard conditions of the SWA scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department issues policy guidelines on the SWA scheme, it is a matter for the com<Col N="164" /> munity welfare officers on the ground to respond to individual cases in what they consider to be an appropriate manner. This necessarily involves treating certain people as exceptional cases requiring supports that are different to the norm. This discretionary aspect of the CWOs' response gives the SWA scheme a unique flexibility in effectively meeting different needs. While this is a major strength of the scheme, in some circumstances it can give rise to a real or sometimes a perceived lack of uniformity in treating apparently similar cases.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has concerns that some asylum seekers are being treated less favourably in certain areas of the country in relation to the administration of any aspect of the SWA scheme I will have the matter looked into if she supplies the relevant details.</P>

      <P>Homeless persons have the same entitlements as any other Irish citizen under the social welfare system. If they are unemployed but capable of and genuinely seeking work, then they can apply for unemployment assistance. They can be paid basic supplementary welfare allowance if they do not fulfil the conditions for any other primary weekly payment from my Department. In addition, they can also apply for payments such as rent supplementation, diet supplement and exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>One of the most important supports provided to homeless people through the social welfare system is assistance with rent deposits to enable them to secure private rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>The main policy initiative taken recently in relation to homelessness was the establishment of a cross departmental team on the issue, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The team also included representatives of my Department and the Departments of Education and Science, Finance, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Its report was published last year by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, and the main recommendations have been accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, action plans for the delivery of services to homeless people are being drawn up by local authorities and health boards. Additional funding has been provided and a forum on home<Col N="165" /> lessness is being established in each county, bringing together the statutory and voluntary agencies responding to the needs of homeless people.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Action Plan on Homelessness was recently published and provides for the establishment of the Dublin Homeless Services Agency to co-ordinate and manage an integrated approach to the delivery of services to homeless people. My officials have been in contact with the agency with a view to ensuring that my Department contributes to improving the position of homeless people where possible. In addition, my Department has provided additional resources to the Eastern Regional Health Authority's homeless persons unit to assist them in improving the level of service that they provide to homeless people.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware I established a working group last year to examine the issues relating to assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. To give a broad spread of expertise, the group comprises representatives from my Department and the Departments of Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Environment and Local Government, as well as a representative appointed by the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The group invited submissions from 30 interested parties, including homeless support groups, the health boards and unions representing community welfare staff. In all, submissions were made by 15 of those invited.</P>
    <P>I understand that the group is currently finalising its report and I expect to receive it shortly.</P>

      <P>The article contains a clear and concise summary of recent trends in relation to income equality and consistent poverty in Ireland. It identifies the need to ensure that everybody benefits from our economic growth &ndash; an approach to which the Government is strongly committed and which forms a central part of our ongoing review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
      <P>The article makes the point that while &lsquo;consistent poverty' remained broadly static between 1987 and 1994, it has fallen substantially since then giving a very different picture to income measures alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distribution of earnings and household incomes is subject to a number of causal factors including falling unemployment, an increase in the employment participation rate of married women, and rapidly rising earnings &ndash; particularly <Col N="166" /> at the top of the income distribution, and the impact of tax and welfare policies.</P>
    <P>Clearly, it would be a matter for concern if those at the bottom of the income distribution were to fall further behind the average over the economic cycle. This can be an indicator of future problems regarding social exclusion, particularly as those towards the bottom of the income distribution tend to be relying on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>This Government has shown itself to be committed to improving the lives of all citizens and this is reflected in our policies. People dependent on social welfare have seen a real improvement in their living standards and, together with the dramatic progress made in terms of employment creation and unemployment reduction, there has been a marked reduction in consistent poverty in recent years.</P>
    <P>However, much remains to be done. The Government has recently approved the Employment Action Plan 2001 which sets out our plans to increase further the employment rate.</P>
    <P>The social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is examining the issues involved in establishing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to ongoing uprating or indexation of payments. An interim report was published in April and a final report is due after the group finishes its deliberations in July.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the group also require it to examine the issue of relative income poverty, another measure of income inequalities.</P>
    <P>The success of policies in recent years in combating unemployment and reducing the level of consistent poverty demonstrates a tangible improvement in the lot of those on lower incomes, notwithstanding the very rapid increase in average incomes driven by the current economic boom. The success of future measures in the area of income adequacy as well as employment, education and other key areas will be necessary to ensure that these improvements can be maintained and enhanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to proposals contained in a recent presentation by the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This covers a wide range of areas of the social welfare system where the IFA are seeking <Col N="167" /> improvements, including farm assist, social insurance and pensions. The main issues are set out briefly as follows.</P>
    <P>The IFA is seeking a change in the treatment of capital expenditure for farm assist purposes. Briefly, the position is that it has not been the practice to include the cost of investment in buildings or their depreciation in means tests, on the basis that it is not the function of the social welfare system to subsidise investment in upgrading the assets of a farm or other business. However, my Department is currently examining the issue of environmentally related capital expenditure which is incurred by farmers in order to comply with EU and National standards.</P>
    <P>The IFA has also proposed the introduction of a new PRSI category for the spouses of self employed contributors, including farmers, who are not currently covered by the system. The PRSI status of farm women was considered by the Advisory Committee on the Role of Women in Agriculture which reported last September. Given the complexity of the issues, the committee recommended that a working group with legal, financial and technical expertise be established to further consider the development of models which will afford farm women financial recognition for their input into farming. This group, which includes representatives from my Department, was established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in April and I will be giving detailed consideration to their findings when available.</P>
    <P>Regarding the extension of disability benefit or invalidity pension to farmers, there are no plans at present to extend social insurance cover for disability benefit, or invalidity pension, to the self employed. The self employed and others who are not covered for disability benefit are eligible to apply for supplementary welfare allowance if they require an income maintenance payment during periods of illness. In addition, people who are suffering from an illness or infirmity which may reasonably be expected to last for a year or more and who do not qualify for invalidity pension are eligible to apply for disability allowance.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board examined the question of extending cover for invalidity pension to the self-employed and, in its final report in 1993, recommended against extending such cover at that time. The board felt that cover for permanent incapacity for the self-employed would be best met through a means tested invalidity allowance. The board's recommendation in this regard has since been met by the introduction of the disability allowance in October 1996.</P>
    <P>In relation to the IFA proposals for easier access the voluntary contributions scheme, access to this scheme is limited to people who have paid PRSI for at least three years and there is currently no provision for retrospective payment. It would be inequitable to relax these conditions for one group, such as farmers, and not for other groups. In addition, if retrospective payment of <Col N="168" /> voluntary contributions were allowed, there is a danger that people would manipulate this situation in order to pay the minimum contribution necessary for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>As regards the possibility of paying special pensions to farmers who were already over the age of 60 when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced in 1988, a balance must be struck between the different demands for pensions concessions, and the need to preserve the benefit-contribution link by requiring an adequate level of contributions for benefits. I consider that the current arrangements represent a reasonable balance between these two factors, and I have no proposals for changes in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department received a submission from the open your eyes to child poverty initiative on the theme of income adequacy in the context of the current review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS. The submission contains a number of proposed targets and actions in relation to child poverty and child income support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child poverty has been identified as a central issue for consideration in the review of the NAPS. As part of the review, existing NAPS targets will be revised as appropriate and consider<Col N="169" /> ation will be given to possible new targets under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, older people, health, and housing/accomodation.</P>
    <P>With regard to adequacy of incomes, the Deputy will be aware that the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group &ndash; established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; is examining the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments. The group's interim report was produced recently and it is planned that the group will complete its deliberations by end-July, 2001.</P>
    <P>The most recent data supplied by the Economic and Social Research Institute suggests that we are beginning to make inroads on the level of child poverty in Ireland. Consistent poverty for children fell from 16.9% in 1997 to 12% in 1998, underlining in particular the positive effects that falling unemployment has on households with children.</P>
    <P>In addition, this Government has demonstrated its commitment to the welfare of children through the heavy investment in the child benefit scheme in recent budgets. Budget 2001 provided for very significant increases in child benefit, with the lower rate, payable in respect of the first two children, being increased by £25 per month, and the higher rate, payable in respect of the third and subsequent children, being increased by £30 per month. These increases will come into effect from next month and will cost £330 million in a full year. Total expenditure on child benefit is now over £900 million per year. Moreover, this Government is committed to spending a total of £1.5 billion in a full year on child benefit by 2003.</P>
    <P>The National Children's Strategy, launched in late 2000, contains an ambitious series of policy objectives for children for the next ten years and provides us with a framework through which we can significantly improve the lives of all our children.</P>

      <P>My Department is to take over the responsibility for charity regulatory matters and for the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as outlined in the White Paper for Supporting Voluntary Activity. It is expected that the order to formally effect the transfer will shortly be signed.</P>
      <P>A White Paper implementation unit has been established in my Department to ensure implementation of the recommendations of the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity. One of its functions is to initiate and prepare the overhaul of the charities legislation.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to preparing this legislation as a priority. It is envisaged that the preparation of the legislation will require three stages: review, consultation and approval. Work has begun on reviewing the current situation and it is hoped to commence the consultation process in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I think it is necessary to ensure the widest possible input from the various interests in order to put legislation in place which is appropriate to present circumstances.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of preparing the legislation, I have been in contact with the Attorney General seeking his views on the types of reforms which might be required at this time. The Attorney General has raised a number of important issues which my Department will examine in the preparation of the draft legislation.</P>
      <P>I have had no specific discussions with the Minister for Finance on this issue to date.</P>
      <P>I will continue to liaise with the Attorney General, the Minister for Finance and all my colleagues as relevant issues arise in the preparation of the charities legislation.</P>

      <P>The EU product liability directive (Council Directive 85/374/EEC) was implemented in Ireland by way of the Liability for Defective Products Act, 1991. The main effect of this legislation was to introduce into Irish law the principle of strict no fault liability on the part of the producer or importer of a defective product. This means that the producer or importer of a defective product is responsible for compensating consumers for damage caused if there is a link between the defect and the damage. The original EU directive permitted member states to exclude primary agricultural products and game from the scope of the implementing legislation. This exemption did not extend to processed food products.</P>
      <P>Council directive 1999/34/EC removed the derogation in the original Directive 85/374/EEC. Directive 1999/34/EEC was transposed by way of the European Communities (Liability for Defective Products) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No 401 of 2000). I am not in a position to give advice on the potential legal implications of this legislation for individuals or groups of producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a considerable body of largely EU derived legislation concerned with the production, marketing and sale of food products directed at protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers. Responsibility for this legislation is spread over a number of Departments, having regard to their respective policy remits.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for the European Communities (Labelling, Advertising and Presentation of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No 92 of 2000). These regulations give effect to EU labelling rules of a general nature that apply to all foodstuffs. These rules are designed to ensure consumers have the information necessary to make informed choices about the products that they purchase. They require that the information provided to consumers be legible, accurate and truthful. Certain specific information must be provided on the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs, including the name of the foodstuff, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer or seller, the list of ingredients, the net quantity and the best before date or date of minimum durability as appropriate. A codified text of the relevant EU rules is contained in European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/13/EC of 13 March 2000. The regulations apply to all foodstuffs placed for sale on the Irish market, with the exception of foodstuffs pre-packaged on a retail premises for direct sale to a consumer to which many of the provisions do not apply.</P>
      <P>There are additional labelling requirements for certain food products. These requirements are specified in legislation that falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is responsible for legislation relating to the labelling of foodstuffs intended for specific nutritional uses, such as baby food.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 a total of £24 million is available for recreational and tourism angling in the regions. Of this total an amount of £17 million is allocated to the Border, midlands and western region and £7 million to the southern and eastern region. When this measure is launched, applications for funding will be invited from fisheries boards and other public and private interests.</P>
      <P>The Western Regional Fisheries Board informs me that its overall Corrib development programme, which includes loughs Mask and Carra, has been approximately 50% completed. The Corrib development programme received significant funding under the Tourism Angling Measure 1994-1999 and it is open to the board to submit an application for funding for the completion of further elements of the programme under the national development plan in due course.</P>
      <P>This year I have secured additional capital funding to be spent by the fisheries boards in support of catchment management projects in co-operation with local fisheries interests and angling clubs. My Department will shortly be allocating funding to the boards, including the western board, across a range of catchment management projects.</P>

      <P>The primary policy objective is to eliminate the illegal activities of flagships through effective controls. The priority is to ensure compliance with the conservation rules by all EU fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>The rules have been tightened by virtue of the new EU fisheries control regulations which came into force last year. The regime now in place allows for enhanced inspection and monitoring arrangements for flagships. The specific requirement whereby flagships must provide at least four hours notice of intention to land into ports other than those of their flag State represents a significant improvement in control measures.</P>
      <P>I am continually pressing at EU level for the effective enforcement of the rules in an even-handed manner by all member states. I have also regularly impressed this on Commissioner Fischler. In this regard the Commissioner has assured me that he shares my determination to enhance controls right across the EU.</P>
      <P>We will continue to push forward on all possibilities for ensuring effective controls on these vessels bearing in mind the EU treaty provisions on right of establishment and freedom of movement.</P>

The frequency, methodology and intensity of sampling is carried out in accordance with this directive and with Commission Decision 98/179/EC which lays down detailed rules on monitoring. Most recent sampling results forwarded to the EU Commission showed that residues of Ivermectin, a sea lice treatment prescribed under veterinary prescription, were detected in farmed salmon samples taken from one farm on one occasion during 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Institute also monitors levels of environmental contaminants in shellfish and finfish under EU legislation. Annual sampling is carried out of shellfish growing areas and on a range of wild finfish species. Results show that levels of environmental contaminants are well within EU limits or international guidelines. Monitoring programmes are kept under regular review in line with EU and national developments to ensure <Col N="178" /> that the highest quality and food safety standards, and best environmental practice are complied with.</P>

      <P>The administration of animal remedies in Ireland is governed by the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, which transposes into Irish law EU legislation regarding the supply and use of veterinary medicines in the EU. Sampling and monitoring programmes for a wide range of residues in farmed fish are carried out by the Marine Institute under EU Directive 96/23. Annex III to the directive provides that wherever official samples are taken, sampling must be unforeseen and unexpected. All practical efforts are made to ensure that the element of surprise in the checks is constantly maintained.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of sea lice levels at marine salmonid farms is carried out by the Marine Institute on behalf of my Department under the national sea lice monitoring programme. The monitoring programme involves the inspection and sampling of each year class of fish at all marine finfish sites 14 times per annum. Under this programme advance notice of inspections is given to the farms who have responsibility for the transportation of inspection personnel to the sites, and is also provided to the relevant regional fisheries board in accordance with agreed protocols. In addition, there are a number of farms where on foot of a High Court order, 72 hours advance notice of inspections must also be provided by the institute to the legal representatives of a fishery owner. Current stringent management practices and controls governing the operation of fish farms are kept under continuous review in line with Government's policy objective for the sustainable development of aquaculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of the Retired Aviation Staff Association &ndash; RASA. Over the past two years or so I have responded to numerous representations on the concerns of RASA about the Irish airlines, general employees, superannuation scheme. I have also met representatives from RASA and senior officials from my Department met the association on two occasions last year. Earlier today, senior officials had a further meeting with the association. In addition, the association has also met senior management representatives from Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta in relation to their concerns.</P>
      <P>The task force on pensions established by the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta at my request submitted their report to the chairmen at the end of May 2000. Arising from the companies consideration of the report, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta each decided to establish new pension schemes for their staff and existing pensioners. Against the backdrop of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta proposals to establish new pension schemes and their response to RASA's concerns, the association revised their proposals for enhanced pension entitlements for pensioners.</P>
      <P>As regards pension enhancements in a new scheme to benefit both serving staff and existing pensioners, the companies' position is that these will emerge from negotiations with representatives of staff which are associated with strategic change initiatives in respect of both companies. In the case of Aer Lingus, this means the privatisation of the airline as decided by the Government. It is Aer Lingus' intention to implement the new pension scheme as soon as possible after the privatisation of the airline is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the proposed new pension schemes are essentially a matter for the companies concerned to negotiate with staff interests tak<Col N="180" /> ing account of a number of factors not least affordability and industrial relations priorities for the companies concerned. Existing Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners who transfer to the new Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta schemes will receive the improved benefits when the new schemes are introduced.</P>
    <P>In relation to funding the pensioners' revised proposals, the chairmen of the companies concerned have advised me that neither Aer Lingus nor Aer Rianta is in a position to provide additional payments into the pension fund. There is no question of any State funding or any of the proceeds from the privatisation of Aer Lingus being provided towards the Irish airlines, general employees, superannuation scheme or the proposed new schemes to be established by either Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no EU funds for airport developments in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>However, an amount of £11 million, 1999 prices, Exchequer funds has been allocated over that period under the local infrastructure programme of the National Development Plan to assist infrastructural improvements and upgrades in facilities at the six regional airports. There has been no expenditure of those funds to date but my Department has invited each of the airport authorities concerned to submit their proposals for grant assistance to the Department by 31 May 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funds provided under the NDP, I have in recent years enhanced the programme of support for the marketing and promotional efforts of the regional airports. A sum of £1.5 million has been made available for this purpose in the current year and my Department is currently assessing the proposals from the airports for assistance from this fund.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have already allocated a sum of £200,000 from this marketing fund to Waterford Airport in recognition of the particular financial difficulties in which that airport found itself earlier this year. Of this, £150,000 has already been paid over to the airport authorities in Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 78 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to salmonella in the pig and poultry sectors.</P>
      <P>The position in the pig sector is that a voluntary scheme for the testing for salmonella has been in operation in pig slaughter plants for a number of years. This programme provided for the categorisation of pig farms on the basis of salmonella test results and the handling of pigs at slaughter plants according to their category.</P>
      <P>Last year I had decided to proceed, in consultation with the industry, with the introduction of a compulsory testing scheme. However, the programme has been interrupted due to problems concerning the nature of the test being used in commercial laboratories to detect salmonella. A solution has now been found which involves the use of my Department's central veterinary research laboratory facilities at Abbottstown to initially conduct the testing in order to get the scheme up and running. Recruitment of additional staff for the programme is now well under way and the employment contracts will be finalised in a matter of days. This revised scheme is being put on a statutory basis. I expect the testing element of the programme to be operational in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>As regards poultry, my Department has since 1988 operated a salmonella monitoring programme in poultry breeding flocks, table egg layers and poultry meat carcases. The flocks programme was set up as a voluntary code of practice with the co-operation of the various elements of the industry. The programme sets out approved guidelines for the control of salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis. Infected flocks are slaughtered and restocking may take place only after official clearance has been granted on the basis of adequate cleaning and disinfection of premises. There is a very low incidence of these infections in the national flock.</P>

      <P>The provisions governing the transfer of milk quota are laid down in the 2000 milk quota regulations. There are a number of options, as outlined, open to such producers under the provisions of these regulations: it is possible for active milk producers, who cease milk production on ill-health grounds, to sell their quota together with the land to which it is attached; transfer by way of sale, lease or gift, the quota and lands to a family member, as defined in regulation 6 of the regulations; if they wish to retain their lands, the quota can be sold under a restructuring scheme or leased under a temporary leasing scheme for three consecutive years. There is, however, a provision in the regulations which enables the Minister to grant an exemption from the three year leasing restriction where the applicant has ceased milk production on ill health grounds but where the applicant or his or her successor intends to resume production in the short-term; it is open to quota holders who are no longer involved in milk production to transfer, by way of sale, lease or gift, the quota and lands to a family member; sell the quota under a restructuring scheme or temporary lease the quota if the quota has not been temporary leased for three consecutive years. The options, outlined in the second instance, above, are also open on expiry of the lease to persons who have leased their land and quota prior to 13 October 1999. Furthermore, lessors have the option to sell the milk quota to lessees, with or without leased lands.</P>

      <P>It is important that the restructuring and temporary leasing schemes be completed as soon as possible in order to ensure that the producers who acquire the quota under these schemes can fully and efficiently utilise the acquired quota within the current milk quota year. Therefore, I have fixed the closing date for the restructuring scheme and the temporary leasing scheme for 30 June 2001 and 31 July 2001 respectively and I have no proposals to depart from these dates. Co-operatives may fix earlier deadlines if it suits the particular needs of their suppliers. The dates in both cases were chosen on the basis of advice given to me by the milk quota review group which comprises representatives from all interested parties.</P>

      <P>I have announced a further easing of foot and mouth disease, FMD, controls relating to the movement under permit of cattle, consequent on receiving the latest recommendations of the expert advisory group which met earlier in the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the adjustments to existing restrictions which I announced were the following measures relevant to marts: as and from 1 June 2001, marts may act as centres for the assembly of consignments of cattle from farms for onward movement to one other farm. This will be of particular benefit to smaller producers and will also ease the situation of buyers; as and from 1 June 2001, marts and other approved premises may act as centres for the assembly of consignments of cattle from farms for onward movement for export purposes; in addition, arrangements are being finalised for the direct transport of cattle to export points; the operational details of the above arrangements will be settled in discussion between the Depart<Col N="184" /> ment and the mart groups; CMMS provisions, where relevant, will apply; the use of mart weighbridges for weighing consignments of cattle will be allowed, with immediate effect, provided that animals are not unloaded from vehicles; an indicative date of 18 June 2001 has been set for the resumption of normal mart operations for cattle.</P>
    <P>Marts, of course, already play a role in the assembly of cattle for movement to slaughter plants. Existing restrictions in relation to the movement of sheep will remain in force until further notice and the mart operations described above do not apply to sheep.</P>
    <P>In announcing these adjustments I have made it clear that vigilance, adherence to protocols and application of bio-security measures, particularly on farms and related premises, continues to be necessary. Cases of FMD continue to occur in Britain, there remains some uncertainty in relation to the cases in Northern Ireland and the large-scale serological testing programme of sheep flocks in this country has yet to be completed. Notwithstanding the fact that a further easing of our controls is now possible, we cannot allow ourselves to think that FMD is no longer a threat.</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>In Ireland there is a low incidence of BSE. A comprehensive range of measures is in place for the control and eradication of the disease. This includes compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of the BSE herd and the birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animals, a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals.</P>
    <P>These measures have been strengthened by a programme of targeted active surveillance for BSE among fallen and casualty animals. In addition all cattle over 30 months of age entering the food chain are now being tested for BSE.</P>
    <P>This regime has been independently verified by a number of independent bodies, including the food and veterinary office of the European Commission, and found to be operating effectively. Last year the conclusions of the EU Commission's geographical risk assessment of member states and third countries was that the system operating in Ireland has been optimally stable since 1998.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this range of measures is proving effective and that it provides a sound basis for consumer confidence in beef, for the protection of public health and for the ultimate eradication of the disease from the national herd.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it appropriate to set a target date for the eradication of the disease in Ireland at this stage. I believe the basis of the veterinary advice available to me, that the disease is reaching its peak. While I accept that there may be additional cases this year and next year, particularly in light of the additional surveillance under way, the age profile of cases being identified would indicate that the level of cases should begin to decline thereafter.</P>

These relate both to primary production at farm level and to factory production. They are funded through the food sub-programme of the operational programme for industrial development, which is administered by my Department by agencies such as Teagasc and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the EU FAIR agricultural research programme.</P>
      <P>Projects currently under way include studies relating to the potential role of water and slurry in the transfer of e.coli 0157:H7 on farms, the biocontrol of the pathogen by isolating naturally inhibitory microflora from soil, vegetation and water, the influence of animal diet and the survival of the pathogen in faeces, grass and soil.</P>

      <P>Under relevant legislation, European Communities (Animal Remedies and Medicated Feedingstuffs) Regulations, 1994 and Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, there are strict rules governing the prescription by veterinarians of therapeutic antibiotics and all other prescription medicines. It is fair to say that the rules in place in Ireland are among the strictest in the EU and Ireland has called on the European Commission to harmonise rules in this important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key elements of the regime in place in Ireland can be described as follows: the veterinarian must have taken professional responsibility for the animal or animals and must have sufficient knowledge of the current health, welfare and disease status of the animals on the farm; the veterinarian must visit the farm concerned sufficiently often; and the veterinarian, prior to issuing a prescription in each instance, must satisfy him or herself as to the appropriate form of treatment necessary. This professional diagnosis must be based either on a clinical examination at the time of prescription or, in certain cases, where there is in place a formal health scheme for the farm under his-her responsibility, on the results of the requisite tests on the animal concerned. A veterinary prescription may cover supply of medicines <Col N="190" /> for a period not in excess of 31 days. There are strict rules governing record keeping both by the veterinarian and by the farmer and strong inspection powers are available to officers of the Minister.  </P>

      <Quest>the agricultural chemicals, antibiotics and pesticides, previously permitted for use by his Department which are now banned; when they were banned; and if traces of these chemicals are likely to still persist in quantities that could be damaging, either in the bodies of those who consumed food where such products were used or otherwise.</Quest>

      <P>The statutory regulation of agricultural chemical and pesticides began in Ireland in 1985. Since then a number of <Col N="192" /> compounds, particularly a number of organochlorine pesticides, have been banned in Ireland mainly because of their persistence properties. The list of pesticides which are banned in Ireland are listed at page 147 of pesticides 2001 which is published by my Department. A number of these compounds were banned in 1981 on the basis of EU Directive 79/117.</P>
      <P>Many of these chemicals are persistent organochlorine pesticides and as such can remain intact in the environment for a considerable number of years. It is still possible to find residues of DDT, Dieldrin, HCH and others in food but the residues detected are usually at or close to the limit of detection and are continuing to decline with time. When residues are found it is possible to estimate the risk to the consumer by comparing the dietary intake with existing acceptable daily intake, where available. The presence of trace levels of these compounds in food is not considered to be a risk to the consumer. The list of these compounds which are analysed in samples of food are indicated in my Department's publication of Pesticides Residues in Food and the residues detected are also included in the report.</P>
      <P>Since 1999 five antibiotic feed additives have been prohibited for use in animal feedingstuffs throughout the EU. It is highly unlikely that any residues of their use persist in either food or consumers since these antibiotics have been banned for over two years. The five antibiotics are Avoparcin, Bacitracin zinc, Spiramycin, Virginiamycin and Tylosin phosphate.</P>

      <P>At present Carbendazim is used as a fungicide in Ireland. Traces of Carbendazim are found in food on sale in Ireland. The results of the annual monitoring programme have been published since 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carbendazim has been reviewed by the EC under Council Directive 91/414/EEC international review programme for plant protection products. The final decision with respect to inclusion into Annex 1 of this directive and with <Col N="194" /> respect to toxicological classification has not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>Carbendazim has been tested for reproductive and developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits. There are two sets of data available, one carried out using the dietary route of exposure and one set using the gavage or intubation route of exposure. When Carbendazim is administered <i>via</i> diet to rats and rabbits, there are no relevant effects on reproduction or development of the foetus. When the gavage dose is used there are severe adverse effects on the testes resulting in infertility and teratogenic effects in the foetuses. The difference in results between the two routes of administration is due to the gradual ingestion and continuous metabolism that occurs via the dietary route so that sufficiently high levels of the chemical cannot occur in the blood.</P>
    <P>The scientific committee on plants was asked the following question. Can the SCP comment on the advisability of establishing an acceptable daily intake and an acceptable operator exposure level having regard particularly to the results of reproductive data for the active substance, reference No. SCP/Carben/002-Final, 23 March 2001? In essence this question is asking whether a safe, for the occupationally exposed and the consumer, use of this substance can be recommended. The response referred to the extensive scientific literature which demonstrates that Carbendazim and related substances interfere with cellular division and that this interference is at the root of all of the adverse effects of this substance, including reproductive and developmental effects. They concluded that as a dose related mechanism was firmly established it was therefore possible to identify a dose level that will have no toxicological effect. In other words, a safe use should be achievable.</P>
    <P>The current proposal for an ADI is 0.02 mg/kg/day based on the developmental studies in rats and rabbits and includes a 500 fold margin of safety above the lowest no adverse effect level of 10 mg/kg/day. The proposed acceptable operator exposure level is 0.04 mg/kg/day using a 250 fold safety margin.</P>

      <P>Vinclozolin is used as a fungicide in Ireland. Its residues are found in food on sale in Ireland. The results of the annual monitoring programme have been published since 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vinclozolin is under review by the EC under Council Directive 91/414/EEC international review programme for plant protection products. <Col N="195" /> The final decision with respect to inclusion in Annex 1 of this directive and with respect to toxicological classification has not yet been agreed. The current draft report of the Standing Committee on Plant Health (5038/VI/98-rev 0, Appendix II, 27 April 2001) states that Vinclozolin causes infertility in male rats by feminisation of the male foetus and alterations in the inner and outer male genital organs. The no adverse effect level for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of any such effect in rabbit studies. The Scientific Committee for Plants was asked to give an opinion on the risk to man from exposure to this substance. It replied that there was sufficient evidence to establish a mode of action by which the reproductive effects were mediated. It concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that man is more sensitive than rats to these effects and that it is unlikely that a single dose could induce a developmental effect, SCP/VINCLO/ 019-Final, 28 October 1999.</P>
    <P>The proposed acceptable daily intake is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day based on the two year rat feeding study NOAEL of 1.2 mg/kg/day. A 250 fold safety factor was used. This gives a wide margin of safety to the NOAEL for reproductive effects.</P>

      <P>The EU has built up a significant body of laws governing the production, marketing and sale of food products directed at protecting the health and safety of consumers. Responsibility for this legislation is spread over a number of Departments.</P>
      <P>Currently in the EU all pre-packaged prepared meals must be labelled in accordance with Council Directive 2001/13/EC relating to the labelling presentation and advertising of foodstuffs as implemented by the EC (Labelling, presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 92 of 2000). Preparation of these regulations is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and they are enforced by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland through the environmental health services of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also rules governing the traceability of food of animal origin such as provided under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1760/2000 on the establishment of a system of identification and registration of bovine animals and the labelling of beef and beef products. This regulation has been implemented by the EC (Labelling of beef and <Col N="196" /> beef products) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 435 of 2000) and is the responsibility of my Department.</P>
    <P>Further legislation to reinforce consumer protection is being proposed by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The draft regulation laying down the principles and requirements of, food law, establishing the European Food Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety proposes to establish a comprehensive system of traceability in order that targeted and accurate withdrawals can be undertaken or information given to consumers or control officials. I also place a greater onus on food businesses to ensure that the food they supply is safe and that they are held legally responsible for the product's safety.</P>
    <P>All food for sale in the European Union, whether produced inside or outside of the EU, must be produced according to EU rules. Manufacturing and processing plants outside the EU are inspected by the European Commission according to EU standards and only then are the products permitted to be imported.</P>

      <P>I am aware that livestock can be delivered to meat plants at times when Department officers are not in attendance, that is during night hours. Slaughter plants are legally required to ensure that the animals which they accept at their plants are identified in such a manner that allows the veterinary inspector at the meat plant, who undertakes the ante mortem inspection, to determine their origin. This legal requirement applies irrespective of the time of delivery of the livestock.</P>
      <P>Official attendance by departmental inspection officers is required before slaughter commences to allow for examination of the required documentation and for ante and post mortem examination. Under the existing foot and mouth disease permit requirements all livestock must be accompanied by permit documentation at the time of arrival at the slaughter plant.</P>
      <P>As for the specific allegations made by the Deputy, I am making inquiries into the matter. If the Deputy has any further information in relation to this matter or if he can indicate the source of his information, I suggest that he might provide this information in writing to my Department.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have figures for the number of vacancies for orthodontists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the situation regarding staff shortages in speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. I have taken a number of steps to deal with the problem, including the commissioning of a workforce planning study by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, which will be published shortly, increasing the number of student places in the therapy schools and implementing the recommendations of the expert group report on various health professions. As an interim measure, following discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the <Col N="199" /> Higher Education Authority, the number of training places for speech and language therapy was increased by eight, physiotherapy training places were increased by 52 and occupational therapy training places increased by five from October 2000.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the capacity of the colleges does not allow for a greater expansion in the number of places for speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. I am confident that a substantial number of additional training places will be provided as a result of the study by Dr. Bacon. The pay and career structures for the therapy grades have been significantly enhanced as the result of the implementation of the expert group's report, which should aid in the recruitment and retention of staff.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to orthodontists is that following recommendations in the Moran report, entitled Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. These structural changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. It will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. This year additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services, of which £3.7 million will fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>Health boards are in the process of ensuring that straightforward application and appropriate administrative procedures are in place for the processing of applications for medical cards by persons aged 70 years before the due date of 1 July 2001. In that context, the actual design of the application form is being examined with a view to preparing a more simplified one having regard to the automatic eligibility nature of the budget provision. The forthcoming public information campaign will include details of application procedures and how eligible persons will benefit under the scheme from the due date.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are also in hand with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on the subject of the implementation of the budget provision to ensure that the measure is implemented in an agreed and timely manner. These negotiations will be concerned, in part, with ensuring that GPs and pharmacists play an active and positive role in advising benefitting persons on how they can effectively access these new entitlements. The negotiations will also deal with the issue of non-GMS doctors with eligible patients.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the peaks in the incidence of foodborne illness that occur over the summer months. The reasons for the increases are varied and complex and are in part due to temporary food workers not being adequately trained.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland &ndash; FSAI &ndash; has a remit to protect consumers' health. It does so by ensuring that food legislation is fully enforced. It also provides training support to food control agencies who work under contract to the FSAI and who provide food safety and food hygiene education to producers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and caterers.</P>
      <P>It is a legal requirement that staff involved in the food chain are adequately trained and/or supervised commensurate with their work activity. The responsibility for training and supervision of staff lies clearly with the proprietor of every food business. This is the case for all staff, whether they are part-time, full-time or casual, or whether they are employed in the public or private sector.</P>
      <P>The FSAI is setting training standards which must be demonstrated at various stages of employment in order to produce safe food in accordance with current legislation, and in line with best practice. These training standards will be used by enforcement officers during inspections to ascertain the level of training in place, and industry's compliance with the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>Training standards are outlined in a series of guides which are currently being prepared by the FSAI. Each guide is being produced in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders in the Irish food industry. Intended to be user-friendly for employers on training of staff in food safety, these guides will be used by enforcement officers when assessing food safety training in the workplace. To assist the employer, each guide will also outline the activities which are necessary to support the training and which will allow the employee to demonstrate best practice.</P>
      <P>The guide which is the most suitable for the training of temporary staff in the retail sector is titled Food Safety Training Standard &ndash; Level One. It outlines the training which must be demonstrated at induction stage of employment. The guide will be officially launched next week and I will arrange for it to be distributed by the FSAI to the food retail sector immediately thereafter.</P>
      <P>In June 2001 the FSAI will launch a major initiative aimed at bringing together the relevant enforcement and education authorities to develop a strategy for food safety training. This initiative will focus particularly on transient workers in the food industry, and will address the need to develop appropriate training strategies for those workers where English is not their first language.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the trends regarding obesity among young people and concerned that unhealthy lifestyle habits at a young age will pose greater health difficulties in later life such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Two key lifestyle issues associated with obesity are unhealthy eating and physical inactivity. The national healthy eating campaign, run by the health promotion unit of my Department, has over the past nine years sought to raise awareness of young people on healthy eating. Recently the campaign has encouraged the public to look at their fat intake and to reduce total fat in particular saturated fat. This campaign stresses that the key to a healthy lifestyle is small gradual changes to eating and exercise habits in order to maintain the correct body weight. The theme of this year's national healthy eating campaign is Ready, Steady, Go for Low Fat Healthy Eating and addresses key eating and physical activity issues associated to obesity and low fitness levels.</P>
      <P>In relation to physical activity, the second phase of Ireland needs a Change of Heart, a national mass media campaign to promote heart healthy lifestyles, is focusing on physical activity. Launched this week, the campaign will target the sedentary population, in particular older people and the workplace. A booklet developed to support the campaign, will be available to the public and will be delivered to targeted socially disadvantaged areas. This booklet includes activities for families and young people.</P>
      <P>Both of these campaigns are run nationally and supported at local level in the health boards by a range of activities throughout the year.</P>

      <P>Recent concern has been expressed, arising from a UK research report, about an increase in mortality from cancer of the bile duct &ndash; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.</P>
      <P>The average number of new cases occurring in Ireland each year reported since the establishment of the national cancer registry is 15 to 20 with no overall increase over that time. Cancer of the bile duct has not been recorded as a cause of death by the registry because such a specific diagnosis may not be entered onto death certificates.</P>
      <P>The observed increase in mortality reported by UK researchers is based on a study of deaths between 1968 and 1998 reported in the June edition of GUT, a medical journal in the field of gastroenterology. The authors conclude that the reported increase may represent better case ascertainment and diagnosis due to improved diagnostic imaging, use of image guided biopsies, or increased use of ERCP, a radiological procedure which produces images of the bile duct. They also state that the observed increase may represent a true increase in intrahepatic bile duct tumours. In the course of the paper they offer certain possibilities which could explain a real increase if one were to exist but the degree to which the increase seen can be attributed to either an increase in reporting or in true incidence or both remains to be examined with further research. No evidence exists which establishes a causal link between an increase in the incidence of bile duct cancer and contaminants or toxins being consumed.</P>

      <P>The process of consultation with the peer-reviewed scientific literature involves examination of the MEDLINE database which contains material from 1966 to the present day and covers over three thousand journals and many millions of articles. It is maintained by the national library of medicine in the United States and is universally recognised as an authoritative source of evidence which has been subjected to peer-review scrutiny. No papers were identified from this source which support the conclusion that a causal link between exposure to lindane in the forms suggested and breast cancer exists. Consultation with Irish experts in the field confirms this view.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease and is one of the commonest cancers in this country. Variations in the number of cases seen in local areas do occur for reasons other than being related to variations in the underlying causes of cancer. The national cancer registry provides data on cancer occurrence between 1994 and 1997. These data do not support the hypothesis that there are significant regional variations in the occurrence of breast cancer. There is, therefore, not a case to be made for a study as suggested.</P>

      <P>On 8 November 2000, the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Authority, and laying down procedures in matters of food safety. Since adoption of the proposal intensive work has been undertaken at EU level with the aim of agreeing a common position on the proposal among member states.</P>
      <P>Chapter III of this proposal deals with the establishment of a European Food Authority &ndash; EFA. The proposed EFA will be a separate legal entity from the Union institutions and its main focus will be to provide excellent independent scientific advice to the Commission, member states, national food bodies or the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>In terms of the mission of the EFA, it is envisaged that it will share responsibility with the Commission and member states. The proposal states that the EFA shall act in close co-operation with the competent bodies in member states carrying out similar tasks to those of the authority. It also states that the authority, the Commission and member states will co-operate to promote the necessary coherence between risk assessment, risk management and risk communication functions, and that the member states shall co-operate with the authority to ensure the accomplishment of its mission.</P>
      <P>The Nice European summit on 7-9 December 2000 agreed that the EFA should be operational at the start of 2002. Work at EU level towards agreement of a common position is ongoing and it is likely that this will be achieved by the end of June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland &ndash; FSAI &ndash; was formally established as an independent statutory body on 1 January 1999 under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. The principal function of the authority is to take all reasonable steps to ensure that food produced, distributed or marketed in the State meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene reasonably available and in particular to ensure that such food complies with food legislation and where appropriate with standards or codes of good practice.</P>
      <P>In the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, an agency with responsibility for the promotion of food safety &ndash; the Food Safety Promotion Board &ndash; FSPB &ndash; was established as one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies. The functions of the FSPB, as provided for in the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, are as follows: the promotion of food safety; research into food safety; the communication of food alerts; the surveillance of food-borne diseases; the promotion of scientific co-operation and linkages between laboratories; and the development of cost-effective facilities for specialised laboratory testing. The British Irish Agreement Act, 1999, amended the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998, to modify any of the functions listed above which had previously been a function of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The roles of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Food Safety Promotion Board are complementary. There is a need, however, to ensure that the two organisations work closely together and this is provided for in the legislation of the two organisations. At the operational level, close co-operation is enhanced by some common membership on the respective boards of the bodies.</P>
      <P>In relation to the promotion of food safety, the FSPB will have primacy in this area, particularly in relation to general awareness campaigns. However, the FSAI may still engage in promotion in support of its compliance functions, for example, provision of good practice guidelines to industry. The FSAI had previously been active in general promotion, but is increasingly withdrawing from such areas as the FSPB becomes fully operational.</P>
      <P>In relation to research, the FSPB has a general remit in relation to research and has already commissioned a number of projects as a result of research calls. In examining priorities for research, the FSPB liaises with other food safety research funding bodies, to obviate any duplication of effort. The FSAI may also undertake certain research projects in the performance of its functions. In deciding whether to commission any such research, the FSAI is required to have regard to any such undertaking by other persons in the state or by the FSPB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the communication of food alerts, the FSPB is responsible for developing and moni<Col N="212" /> toring protocols for the dissemination of food alerts and in this regard work closely with the FSAI and the food standards agency in Northern Ireland. The FSAI is the national contact point for the EU rapid alert system for foodstuffs. The authority is obliged to notify the Commission if unsafe food is on the market in Ireland or if such food has been exported to member states. The FSAI is also obliged to take appropriate action in a response to a notification from the Commission on the rapid alert system for foodstuffs. In relation to the development of specialised laboratories, the FSPB has been given the remit to assess the feasibility of developing such laboratories for the whole island.</P>
    <P>The FSAI and the FSPB are in daily contact at all levels and keep each other fully informed of their activities. The bodies are also working jointly in a number of areas. I am satisfied that there is no duplication of activities or expenditure. The respective budgets are as follows: the Food Safety Promotion Board has been allocated a total of £6.5 million in 2001 &ndash; £4.550 million to be provided by the South and £1.950 million from the North; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has been allocated a total of £5.92 million in 2001.</P>

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland &ndash; FSAI &ndash; monitors the safety of food in the food chain in conjunction with 41 official agencies and their associated laboratories. Through this network of co-operation it is ensured that all food consumed, distributed, marketed or produced in the state meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seven health boards and the three area health boards within the Eastern Regional Health Authority have responsibility for the inspection of premises and the enforcement of food safety <Col N="213" /> legislation in the non-veterinary food sector, including manufacture, wholesale, distribution and retail premises. They operate under service contracts with the FSAI and provide laboratory services. There are seven public health microbiological laboratories and three public analyst, chemical and physical, laboratories accredited by the national accreditation board for a comprehensive range of analytical methods. In addition there is a central reference facility for salmonella located in University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
    <P>The public health microbiological laboratories within the health boards monitor a wide range of retail foods for the presence of micro-organisms, with ready-to-eat foods sampled at the point of sale being the priority for microbiological surveillance. Complaint samples are also submitted by members of the general public. Results from the laboratory analysis of food samples are forwarded to the FSAI where a database has been developed to facilitate the presentation of the national results.</P>
    <P>The public analyst's laboratory service is responsible for surveillance of food for chemical contaminants and deals with complaint samples from the public. Chemical testing is performed on a broader range of foodstuffs and with a wider range of test parameters than those used for microbiological testing. In 2000, these laboratories have analysed in excess of 9,000 samples with a 97% satisfactory rate. Each year sampling programmes are prepared with central co-ordination by the FSAI. This process involves close examination of results from previous years, Europe-wide data from a rapid alert system and other issues of public health concern.</P>
    <P>Foods are being tested as part of three-year plan allowing a wide range of foods and contaminants to be analysed. The system is flexible enough to allow sampling at local level in addition to the sampling plan, for example, following complaints or suspected food poisoning. Legislative requirements are incorporated in the plan and full coverage can be expected within the aforementioned three year plan. Where gaps were identified, methods for detection are currently being developed which will allow for their incorporation into next year's programme.</P>

      <P>A programme of surveillance on the level of salmonella and campylobactor in raw poultry meat is ongoing and results are expected within two months. The programme involves testing approximately 1,000 samples of imported poultry meat and approximately 2,000 of home produced poultry meat. All samples are tested for the presence of salmonella and campylobactor and any positive isolates are subjected to further typing techniques. They are also tested for the presence of inhibitory substances. Though public health advice will depend on the results of this survey, the FSAI has issued advice to industry and consumers that good hygienic practices should be followed when handling raw poultry. Such products should only be stored at chilled or frozen temperatures, care should be taken to avoid cross contamination with cooked foods and food preparation surfaces, and products should be adequately cooked to kill harmful bacteria that may be present in the raw products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made to date in implementing the national children's strategy. Funding of £2 million has been provided in 2001 to commence the establishment of the new infrastructure necessary to implement it. The first meeting of a Cabinet committee on children, chaired by the Taoiseach, took place on 28 March 2001. The committee will meet on a quarterly basis to review progress and agree priorities for action. Its next meeting will take place on 3 July 2001.</P>
      <P>I am responsible for overseeing implementation of the strategy, in addition to my current statutory role in the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science. I will report to the Cabinet committee on progress being made. A national children's office has been established on an administrative basis and is providing a dedicated team to support me in my expanded role. While Government Departments will retain responsibility for implementing the strategy, the office will co-ordinate and monitor progress by taking a lead role in a number of key policy areas. The committee agreed the priority policy areas and core functions of the children's office at its first meeting in March. The priorities for the office are the implementation of the Children Bill, 1999, and the development of a national play and recreation policy.</P>
      <P>The National Children's Advisory Council has been established and the inaugural meeting took place on 15 May 2001. The council, which has a membership of 30, has an independent advisory role in relation to the implementation of the strategy and reports to me. The functions of the council were set out in the strategy. The council will maintain the partnership approach developed through the strategy to influencing policy on children's issues. It includes representatives of statutory agencies, the voluntary sector, research community, parents and children. At the council's first meeting I proposed two priority areas to be addressed, the voice of children and play and recreation and the areas were agreed by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> The implementation of the strategy at local community level began in February with a conference for county and city development boards &ndash; CDBs &ndash; jointly hosted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey and I. The CDBs are the key bodies to lead implementation of the strategy at local level, through ensuring that children's issues as identified in the strategy are addressed in the strategies for economic, social and cultural development. Children's participation in the development of these strategies was highlighted as an important aspect of the local plans.  </P>
    <P>A series of nationwide road shows, organised by officials of the national children's office and I commenced in February. The purpose of these fora is to promote the strategy among children, families and local communities and to build support for and involvement in its implementation. Each visit commences with a visit to a local school, followed by a forum for community groups, parents and local statutory bodies and the day concludes with a special forum for children and young people, organised with the assistance of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The first regional visit was in Limerick on 23 February but later arrangements were postponed due to foot and mouth disease restrictions. The visits recommenced in May with visits to Cork, Galway, Waterford and south Dublin. Further regional seminars are planned for Donegal, Kerry, Westmeath, north Dublin and Mayo later in the year.</P>
    <P>Plans for the first Dáil na nÓg, due to have taken place on 11 April 2001, have been rearranged for the autumn due to foot and mouth disease. Dáil na nÓg was identified in the strategy as a measure to support its first goal, to give a voice to children. Two hundred children between the ages of eight and 18, representative of every county and socio-economic group, will be invited to attend. In February, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern and I announced the commissioning of a design brief for a national longitudinal study of children. A longitudinal study was identified in the strategy as a key measure to achieve the goal of better understanding children's lives.</P>
    <P>Three doctoral fellowships and two post-doctoral fellowships to pursue research directly related to the strategy are being advertised in the national media this week, to commence in the academic year 2001-2002. The doctoral fellowships are for a period of up to three years and funding of £10,000 per annum plus university fees will be provided to the fellows. The post-doctoral fellowships are for a period of up to two years and funding of £25,000 per annum will be provided. Officials from Government Departments in Northern Ireland have expressed considerable interest in the strategy and officials from the national children's office have had meetings with officials from various government departments in Northern Ireland. A meeting at Minister of State level is currently in preparation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> A special session of the United Nations General Assembly will be held from 19 to 21 September 2001 as a follow up to the World Summit for Children which took place in 1990. The national children's office is undertaking preparatory work as part of the preparations for the session. Governments have been asked to prepare an end of decade report to review progress made since the last world summit on children in 1990. The end of decade report for Ireland is currently being prepared by the national children's office and a draft has been submitted to UNICEF.</P>
    <P>The strategy has been widely distributed around the country to Ministers, TDs, Senators, schools, libraries, health boards, county councils, corporations, city and county development boards, Government Departments, voluntary agencies, vocational education committees and education centres. Copies have also been issued to any member of the public or organisation on request and a number of requests have been received from abroad. To date, 380,000 copies of the national children's strategy have been distributed.</P>

While it is possible to measure the minimum number of times a website has been accessed, in the case of coolchoices.ie this is estimated to be 21,683, the true figure is likely to be a large multiple of this. The design of the cool choices website was experimental in nature. Following evaluation and examination of feedback from users, it is currently offline while improvements are made.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment under the PPF to improve voter participation is being progressed as part of the ongoing review of electoral law. The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, passed Second Stage in the Seanad on 27 February 2001 and I hope to be able to finalise Committee Stage amendments shortly. The Bill, when enacted, will provide for a range of issues which will make a positive contribution to encouraging voter participation.</P>
      <P>In relation to voter registration, the Bill provides for a number of enhancements and clarifications to help streamline that process. These include provision for persons to decide that their names and addresses in the register of electors should not be used for a purpose other than electoral or other statutory use, provision that a registered voter who changes address during the life of a register of electors can apply for entry in the supplement provided he or she gives permission to delete his or her name from the register at the old address, clarification that a person who reaches 18 years on or before polling day is eligible for entry on the supplement and provision that a person employed by a returning officer at an election who is registered to vote in another constituency can be included on the supplement to the postal voter's list. At present, such staff are unable to vote at an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a number of changes in relation to voting including the use of photographs and political party emblems on ballot papers, provision for the inclusion of additional information on polling information cards, the display <Col N="219" /> of a large print copy of the ballot paper in the polling station to assist the visually impaired, a 7 a.m. instead of 8 a.m. opening of polling stations, and provision that persons who are unable to read or write can have a companion vote for them. At present this facility is confined to electors with physical or sight disabilities.</P>
    <P>My Department, as part of the PPF initiative, also carried out an extended publicity campaign in November 2000 to promote registration for the 2001/02 register of electors. The campaign was designed for and specifically targeted young people and disadvantaged communities and stressed the importance of registration, the key dates in the registration process and how to get on the register. The availability of postal voting facilities for certain students and first time registration for young people was also emphasised. It was a multi-media campaign involving national and local radio, newspaper, outdoor advertising and the distribution of over 7,000 posters to registration authorities and the constituent organisations of the National Youth Council of Ireland and the Union of Students of Ireland. It is proposed to build on this campaign this year and in 2002 including a campaign specifically to encourage voting at the next general election.</P>

      <P>My Department is preparing regulations to bring into force the development control provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Current planning regulations require that plans and drawings accompanying an application for planning permission shall indicate the name and address of the person by whom they were prepared. The proposal referred to suggests that applications should only be accepted from persons on a register of designers and planners. The stated purpose is to obviate suspicions relating to persons submitting applications under false names, impose quality and ensure compliance with taxation obligations.</P>
      <P>While the proposal is being considered, I would be reluctant to impose such a requirement because there are other ways of achieving the stated objective. There are also issues to be considered surrounding the limitation of the right to make applications to persons on a register related to the necessity to avoid the creation of anti-competitive barriers. Section 150 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for the adoption by each planning authority and An Bord Pleanála of a code of conduct for dealing with conflicts of interest to promoting public confidence in the integrity of its business. It is my intention to bring Section 150 into force in conjunction with the development control provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>These codes of conduct will consist, <i>inter alia</i>, of a policy on undertaking work, not being work on behalf of the authority or the board, as the case may be, both during and after any period of employment with the authority or the board, whether as a consultant, adviser or otherwise. Compliance with such codes of conduct will be a condition of employment of officers of planning authorities and employees of the board. I believe this is the most appropriate way to ensure that conflicts of interest in the conduct of the business of the authority are minimised. I am also considering various proposals for improving the quality of planning applications.</P>

      <P>The scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing enables local authorities to carry out necessary improvement works to a private house occupied or intended to be occupied by low income households approved for local authority housing as an alternative to the provision of local authority housing. The authority can arrange to have all necessary works of improvement carried out to the house. A small <Col N="221" /> weekly or monthly charge is payable by the occupants, based on the cost of the works and the income of the occupants, for a maximum of 15 years. House improvement loans, of up to £6,000 unsecured and £15,000 secured are also available from local authorities for low income households.</P>
      <P>The disabled persons and essential repairs grants and assistance available under the task force on special housing aid for the elderly target available resources at those considered most in need. I have no proposals at this stage to re-introduce a generally available house improvement grant scheme. This would either have the effect of diluting available resources with less funding being available, for example, for elderly people in very poor housing conditions or, in the context of current capacity constraints in the construction sector, to adversely impact on the cost and availability of contractors.</P>

      <P>Contamination by e. coli 0157 generally arises in relation to infection throughout the food chain. There have been no reported instances of such contamination of drinking water supplies in this country. Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities.</P>
      <P>Stringent standards for coliform levels in drinking water are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 81 of 1988). Article 4 of the regulations places a duty on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that water intended for human consumption meets these standards. This duty is performed under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency, which publishes a report annually on the quality of drinking water in Ireland. A copy of the most recent report, in relation to 1999, is available in the Library and provides detailed information in relation to water quality by reference to prescribed parameters.</P>
      <P>Group scheme sector is the subject of a comprehensive programme of measures for improvement under the rural water programme. Last year with the objective of ensuring group water could achieve the highest water quality standards, I introduced a 100% grant for the provision of essential water treatment and disinfection equipment for schemes using private sources. Grants of up to £6,000 per house are also payable for associated upgrading works on group schemes including the provision of source protection measures to safeguard vulnerable water sources from organic pollution. Grants of up to £1,600 per house are available from the local authorities for the upgrading of an individual water supply to a house, including the provision of essential water treatment and disinfection equipment.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6 representing the minimum contribution recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>In assessing a person's means for the purpose of rent supplement all income either in cash or in kind is taken into account. Certain sources of income can be disregarded for this purpose and they are for the most part identified in the third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993. Additional sources of income that may be disregarded are notified to the community welfare officers &ndash; CWOs &ndash; by way of circulars that are issued by my Department. The CWOs also use their national administrative procedures manual which contains instructions on how each type of claim should be processed including details of assessable and non-assessable income.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, the payments relating to crèche facilities paid by a former husband would normally be regarded as assessable whether they are paid directly to the crèche or to the mother. While I am satisfied there is general uniformity across the health boards in administering the SWA scheme it should be borne in mind that it is a matter for the CWOs on the ground to respond to individual cases in what they consider to be an appropriate manner. This discretionary aspect of the CWOs' response gives the SWA scheme a unique flexibility in effectively meeting different needs. While this is a major strength of the scheme, in some circumstances it can give rise to a real or sometimes a perceived lack of uniformity in treating apparently similar cases. I would however be concerned if the SWA means test was being applied in an inconsistent manner. If the Deputy has concerns about a particular case I will have the matter looked into if she supplies the relevant details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the conditions for receiving and retaining rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA <Col N="224" /> scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations.</P>

I have already announced that the alignment of tax and social welfare changes will be maintained when the tax year is brought forward by 13 weeks to coincide with the calendar year from January 2002.

      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme on behalf of my Department. The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The cost of SWA payments to asylum seekers in 2000 was approximately £50 million. This is made up of approximately £32 million in basic payments, £16 million in rent supplements and £2 million in exceptional needs payments &ndash; ENPs. It is estimated that the cost of SWA payments to asylum seekers in 2001 will be in the region of £57.5 million, made up of approximately £36.5 million in basic payments, £18 million in rent supplements and £3 million in ENPs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in expenditure for asylum seekers under the SWA scheme has slowed since the introduction of direct provision on 10 April 2000. As the Deputy is aware, asylum seekers entering the country since 10 April 2000 have for the most part had their needs met through direct provision where accommodation, food and other services <Col N="225" /> are provided. Accordingly they receive a reduced weekly basic payment. As a consequence, the impact on basic SWA expenditure is much less than in previous years. Similarly, as accommodation is provided the only significant impact on rent expenditure is increases in rental costs for those asylum seekers who were in receipt of rent supplements prior to the introduction of direct provision.</P>

      <P>Until the 1970s the qualifying age for old age pensions was 70. In 1970, the retirement pension was introduced for contributors who retired at age 65. Eligibility for retirement pension is conditional on being fully retired from employment and/or self-employment. A person is regarded as being retired if his earnings from employment are less than £30 per week or from self-employment are less than £2,500 per annum.</P>
      <P>In the period 1973 to 1975 the age at which a person became eligible for old age pensions, whether contributory or non-contributory, was progressively reduced from 70 to 66. Consequently, the retirement condition under the retirement pension scheme referred to above, only applies for a year, that is from age 65 to 66. A review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions is currently under way in my Department.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the second phase 2 review include an examination of the current structure of contributory retirement pension arrangements. The question of whether the qualifying age for social welfare pension purposes should be raised or lowered together with associated labour market issues is among the specific issues being considered by the working group set up in this regard. I will consider the issue raised by the Deputy in the light of the report of the group, which will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to providing an efficient service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlements are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply. The average time to award claims for old age non contributory and old age contributory pension is currently eight weeks, for carer's allowance 13 weeks, for farm assist five weeks and for free schemes eight weeks.</P>
      <P>In determining entitlement under any of my Department's schemes there may be PRSI contribution conditions, means or medical conditions or conditions relating to household circumstances to be satisfied. There is inevitably a time lag involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable timely and accurate decisions to be made. The time taken to process individual claims varies significantly having regard to the difficulty or otherwise in establishing the circumstances in each case.</P>
      <P>It should be noted, however, that many applicants for income support payments frequently are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payments will normally continue until entitlement to pension or allowance is determined. Any award of entitlement applies from the date on which the application is made or the date the person reaches pension age. In the case of the old age pension, claims can be made up to three months in advance of the person attaining pension age and in such cases, pensions can be put into payment as soon as the person attains the specified age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there have been a number of very significant improvements made to the carer's allowance scheme. The number of persons who now receive carer's allowance has increased from <Col N="227" /> 10,330 at the end of December 1997, to 17,160 in May 2001. The number of claims now being received from carer's allowance is double the intake over previous years. The scope of the free scheme has also been greatly extended in the last two budgets. It is expected that an additional 80,000 claims will be processed this year, almost doubling the normal annual new claim intake.</P>
    <P>Any increase of this magnitude impacts to some degree on the capacity to process claims quickly. Additional staff resources have been applied by the Department to deal with the extra work volumes for both carer's allowance and free schemes and further resources are being assigned to deal with the extra claim intake. Every effort is made to process all claims as quickly as possible having regard to the eligibility condition governing these schemes. Any delay in the processing of claims will not result in any loss of entitlement to the people concerned.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefit scheme operated by my Department provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. PRSI contributions payable by employees at appropriate rates, Class A, E and H, provide social insurance cover for treatment benefits. However, to qualify for benefit a person must satisfy certain contribution conditions which vary depending on the age of the insured person. I assume the Deputy's question refers to the failure by some persons over age 25 years in satisfying these contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons aged under 21 years of age must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 years of age must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65 years of age the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution conditions for treatment benefit are generally in line with those applying to other contributory benefit schemes. These conditions are necessary to ensure the continuing viability of the scheme while directing limited resources towards those in greatest need. They also ensure a realistic relationship between <Col N="228" /> entitlement to benefit and a continuing or recent attachment to the workforce through an active PRSI contribution record. The lower contribution requirement for a person under 25 is in recognition of the fact that a younger person may have entered insurable employment relatively recently and would have difficulty meeting the higher condition.</P>
    <P>Any changes in the insurance conditions for receipt of treatment benefits would have financial implications and is a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy and the best targeting of available resources. While I have no specific proposals, at present, for changing the qualifying conditions or entitlements under the dental or other areas of the treatment benefit scheme the operation of the scheme is subject to ongoing monitoring by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 170 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over, as well as to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare payments. The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services, including road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, and services provided by 80 private transport operators. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other free schemes, including the free electricity or gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement to ensure that households <Col N="229" /> do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. From October 2000, the free schemes were extended to all persons aged 75 and over, regardless of their income and household composition. In addition, provision was made in budget 2001 to further extend the free schemes to all persons aged 70 years and over from this month.</P>
    <P>With regard to further extensions of the schemes, a review of them, which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, in April last year, noted that they share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion, namely, to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains, to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society. The review of the free schemes examined the many demands to extend the free schemes to other groups using social inclusion objectives as the criteria for decision. It considered that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or disability.</P>
    <P>The review noted that, where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes must be based solely on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income. Accordingly, the review concluded that the schemes should not be extended further to additional groups of people or to include other types of schemes. Overall the proposals in the review will be examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The speed with which claims to benefits under bilateral agreements can be processed is dependent not just on my Department but on the institutions in the other countries party to the agreement. My Department must supply the PRSI records and other details to the other country's institution and wait to receive corresponding information from it. The processing of the claim and the award of the benefit cannot proceed until this information is received and difficulties can arise in relation to incomplete information being provided. In the case of some EU countries to which the EU regulations on social security apply, documents and information exchanged have to be translated which can further add to delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> An initial review of the current situation regarding the processing of these claims has been completed. The next stage will involve obtaining more detailed information on certain aspects with a view to establishing if certain administrative procedures can be modified to speed up the claims processing by my Department. Any changed procedures will be documented in the guidance notes to ensure full continuity of procedures irrespective of staff turnover. The review is also documenting the response times of the institutions in the other countries and the reasons why delays may be occurring. These can vary from country to country. The intention is to bring these to the attention of the authorities in the other countries in a systematic way with a view to satisfactory solutions being found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs administers a broad range of income support payments, comprising insurance &ndash; PRSI &ndash; based payments and social assistance &ndash; means tested &ndash; payments. Since coming into office, I have introduced significant improvements across the full range of supports provided by my Department at a total cost of over £1.8 billion. These include significant improvements in means testing arrangements. I have not introduced any restrictions to the means testing arrangements within my Department. Nor have I made any other policy changes aimed at restricting access to payments. If the Deputy has a particular concern in mind, he should contact me and I will have the matter examined. A list of improvements to means testing sine 1998 is set out below.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the calculation for family income supplement &ndash; FIS &ndash; changed from a gross income to a net income basis and FIS weekly income thresholds increased by £7. The weekly rehabilitative earnings disregard for disability allowance and blind person's pension purposes was increased from £36.30 to £50. Non-national disability pensions up to the level of maximum rate of old age contributory pension were disregarded for carer's allowance purposes. Rental income was exempted from the assessment of means for widow's non-contributory pension purposes, where income is in respect of a person who lives with and pays rent to the pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> Revised arrangements for assessing capital were extended to the rent allowance scheme for former controlled tenancies so that the first £2,000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5% and the balance assessed at 15%. The existing disregard for income under the REP scheme which applied to the unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and old age non-contributory pension schemes was improved so that the first £2,000 is exempted with the balance being assessed at 50%. Enhanced arrangements were also extended to the special scheme of compensation for compliance with the special areas of conservation conditions.</P>
    <P>In 1999, a new means-tested farm assist scheme with enhanced income disregards for farmers on low income was introduced. Improvements were made in the operation of the means test for unemployment assistance for fishermen along the lines of the improvements for farmers under the farm assist scheme. FIS weekly income thresholds were increased by £8. The existing weekly spousal income disregard of £150 for carer's allowance was extended to a couple's joint income and a £75 disregard applied in respect of a carer's own income. The upper income limit for the purposes of tapering the withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance was increased from £90 to £105. The means limit for fuel allowance was increased from £15 to £30 above weekly social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>In 2000, FIS weekly income thresholds increased by £13. There were major improvements in the assessment of capital for all means tested schemes other than supplementary welfare allowance, with the first £10,000 disregarded and the method of assessing the value of capital above this level improved. The weekly rehabilitative earnings disregard for disability allowance and blind person's pension purposes was increased from £50 to £75. There were further improvements in the assessment of means under the farm assist scheme and for fishermen claiming unemployment assistance. A number of improvements were made to arrangements whereby people retain supplementary welfare allowance rent and mortgage supplements on returning to work under schemes such as community employment, back to work allowance and revenue job assist.</P>
    <P>Last year also saw improvements in the operation of the arrangements for tapering the withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance, including an increase in the income range over which the tapering arrangements apply from £60 to £105 up to £70 to £135 and an extension of the improved tapering arrangements to recipients of old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions. The amount of the gross proceeds from the sale of a pensioner's principal residence which can be exempted for means test purposes was increased from £75,000 to £150,000.</P>
    <P>In 2001, FIS weekly income thresholds have been increased by £25. Existing weekly income limits of £75, single, and £150, couple, for carer's allowance purposes are being increased to <Col N="232" /> £125/£250. Provisions limiting the overall amount of disability allowance payable where the spouse is in receipt of another social welfare payment are being abolished. Provisions have been made which enable pensioners on means tested payments to exempt up to £150,000 from the gross proceeds from the sale of their principal residence to be extended to recipients of disability allowance. Those in receipt of one parent family payment are to be allowed to retain 50% of any maintenance received. Exemption of the health board allowance for frail elderly people is to be boarded out for means test purposes.</P>
    <P>The means limit for fuel allowance is to be increased from £30 to £40 above weekly social welfare payment. There has been an easing of the clawback of budget increases in pensions for SWA rent and mortgage supplement purposes by £5 per week and an increase in the upper ceiling for tapered qualified adult allowance arrangements from £135 to £145. Disregard meal and travel allowances are now paid while on training courses to recipients of unemployment assistance and one parent family payment in respect of approved and appropriate courses of a short-term duration. ESF and VEC scholarship scheme grants will now be disregarded for the purposes of unemployment assistance and farm assist. Amounts paid by health boards towards the care of foster children will be disregarded for the purposes of assessing income for entitlement to qualified adult allowance.</P>

      <Quest>if intensive farming practices such as heavy levels of fertilisation, pesticide use and removal of hedgerows have contributed to the reduction in the number of certain species of wildlife; if so, if she will list the species affected giving in each case the rate of estimated decline in the past twenty years; and the other non-agricultural phenomena, which may have contributed to the decline in numbers.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that quantified data is not available on declines in all wildlife species over the past twenty years, which can be attributed to intensive farming. However, the recently published report of the Environmental Protection Agency, which reviews the state of the Irish environment, identifies intensive agriculture as a major cause of the loss of bio-diversity. Intensive farming involving ploughing, removal of hedges and the use of slurry, fertiliser and pesticides can contribute to a reduction in habitat and food sources which support a wide variety of birds and mammals. Hedgerows in particular are a vital source of food and shelter for insects, birds and mammals. The run-off of agro-chemicals into watercourses can also damage fish stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should, however, be aware that there is an ongoing programme of initiatives in <Col N="234" /> my Department whose aim is to afford protection to all species, including species and habitats suffering from intensive agriculture. These include the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, which strengthens the protection for species and habitats; the monitoring of species, including by way of the countryside bird survey which Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, has been partners in and co-funders of since its inception in 1998; and the programme of designation of sites under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.</P>
    <P>I also expect to publish a national biodiversity plan later this year that will provide a basis for promoting biodiversity. In addition, the rural environmental protection scheme, implemented by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has as one of its objectives the promotion of environmentally friendly farming. This is expected to benefit wildlife and includes measures to reduce fertilisation of grasslands and crops, and proper management of hedgerows. Phenomena other than intensive farming practices that may contribute to the decline in species of wildlife could include infrastructural developments such as roads and houses, industrial pollution, coniferous afforestation, arterial drainage, and peat and mineral extraction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that a significant percentage of persons committed to prisons, particularly in the Dublin area, are habitual drug abusers, many of whom actively seek to maintain their habit while in prison custody. The Prisons Service, with my full support, is resolutely committed to tackling this issue in a comprehensive and proactive manner. While there are no plans to establish a specific custodial detention centre solely for drug addicted prisoners, I am informed by the director general of the Prisons Service that expanding the range of measures available to address drug abuse among prisoners is receiving priority attention. This involves a twin track approach of supply and demand reduction. A number of technical and policy measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These include sophisticated video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing. Efforts to eliminate the supply of drugs coming into our prisons are not enough on their own. The Prison Service will continue to seek to reduce demand for drugs within the prison system by the education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are two areas within the prison system which are geared specifically towards prisoners who wish to remain drug free. The drug free unit which is in operation at the training unit adjacent to Mountjoy Prison has accommodation for 96 prisoners. This unit enables prisoners who do not have a history of drug abuse and those who have demonstrated the desire to stop taking drugs to be detained in a drug free and secure <Col N="237" /> environment. These prisoners take regular urinalysis tests to ensure that they are remaining drug free and those who fail in this regard are generally moved back into the general prison population.</P>
    <P>A drug free area with a capacity for 76 inmates is currently operating in St. Patrick's Institution. The aim of this unit is to assist young offenders aged between 16 and 21 years of age, many of whom are serving their first custodial sentence, in combating their drug addiction. This is expected to reduce the risk of these prisoners reoffending in the future and increase their prospects of securing employment on release by remaining drug free.</P>
    <P>At my request the director general of the Prisons Service established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved in 1999. This plan provided a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment of drug addicted offenders and included the expansion of detoxification facilities, drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of drug free units or wings in existing prisons means that motivated prisoners will be offered the support and the opportunity to remain drug free during their time in prison and hopefully afterwards. Meeting these needs will require the identification and provision of suitable locations together with the availability of suitably trained staff to supervise and support the attendant regime.</P>
    <P>A key element is the recruitment of a co-ordinator of drug treatment services in prisons. This post was advertised recently by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The co-ordinator's responsibilities will include the co-ordination and management of the delivery of drug treatment services in prisons and places of detention located in the ERHA area as well as promoting best practice on throughcare in respect of drug dependent persons entering and leaving those institutions. While the filling of this position is a matter for the ERHA, I understand the process is now at interview stage and that every attempt will be made to fill the post at the earliest possible opportunity. Following consultation with the Department of Finance, I expect the Prisons Service and health boards to be very shortly in a position to commence the recruitment process for other drug treatment posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women report to Government, 1993, stated that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> Women in the home are not a uniform group but include traditional homemakers, with the woman taking responsibility for childcare and domestic management while the man is full-time breadwinner; women who combine work outside the home with family responsibilities; women whose primary role is homemaker but who also make a contribution to the family farm or business; women running small businesses from their home; lone mothers; older women who have reared their children; women in households on social welfare benefit or assistance payments; unemployed women.</P>
    <P>My Department has introduced certain measures to make entry and re-entry into the workplace more flexible for women. These include the Employment Equality Act, 1998 which prohibits discrimination in relation to employment, including access to employment, on nine grounds, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Act should facilitate women who give up their employment to care for their children full time in the home and who wish at a later stage to return to paid employment. In particular, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of age will ensure that such women will have the option of re-entering the labour force once they have reared their children. Funding is provided in the regional operational programmes of the national development plan for my Department for an equality for women measure.</P>
    <P>One strand of this measure is devoted to encouraging entrepreneurship among women. The intention is to fund a small number of projects focused on supporting women in business. I expect shortly to announce my decision on projects which qualify for funding under this measure for the period up to end 2003. In addition to active projects, the measure is also funding research on innovative approaches and best practice in supporting women in enterprise. This research has been commissioned by Enterprise Ireland and will be published later this year.</P>
    <P>The measure is also funding research on the information, guidance and supports needs of women who are interested in returning to the workforce after a long period in the home. This research is being managed by the National Women's Council of Ireland and it will also be finalised this year. The tender for the research was awarded to the ESRI. In accordance with Government commitments, the gender dimension of spending under the productive sector operational programme, which includes EU and national funding for business, will be monitored over the life of the national development plan. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and relevant state agencies have committed to collecting gender disaggregated statistics to measure the impact of the operational programme on women and men.</P>
    <P>My Department allocated a grant of £5,000 last year to Women in the Home for development <Col N="239" /> activities and this grant is being increased to £6,000 this year. My Department is working on the development of a national plan for women for the period 2001 to 2005 to be drawn up under the same priority actions or critical areas of concern as defined in the UN Beijing platform for action. A draft plan will include contributions from all relevant Departments under the relevant areas of concern. One of these areas relates to women in the economy and the establishment of a home to business register for women in the home would be appropriate to this area. My Department will enter into a consultation process with women and their representative groups when the draft plan is approved by Government.</P>

      <P>It is open to community based not for profit groups to apply for capital and staffing grants under the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000 to 2006, which is operated by my Department. EU and Exchequer funding comprising £344 million has been allocated to my Department over the course of the national development plan between 2000 and 2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis. This funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Mary Wallace, met with this group in Dáil Éireann on Wednesday 16 May 2001, following which application forms were issued to the group. Two completed applications for capital funding have since been received by the equal opportunities child care section of my Department from the group, on 23 May 2001. These applications will now be forwarded to Area Development Management Limited, which will carry out a technical assessment of the applications on behalf of my Department. This will be followed by an assessment by the programme appraisal commit<Col N="241" /> tee chaired by my Department before referral to me for final decision. As outlined in the general guidelines for funding measures, applications are assessed according to five criteria: the socio-economic profile of the area relating to the application, the quality of the proposal, the capacity of the applicant to implement the project, the level of integration and co-ordination and the costings or value for money of the proposal.</P>
    <P>I will make a decision shortly after the completion of the assessment and appraisal process. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the applications. Colour RGB 0,0,128 The Minister of State or a representative of my Department will gladly meet again with this group to provide any advice or support required.</P>

      <P>The new programme entitled, Giving Children an Even Break, is designed to tackle educational disadvantage and was launched by me in January. It has an urban and rural dimen<Col N="244" /> sion. The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension.</P>
      <P>Under the urban dimension of the new programme, I am committed to supporting schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils in the maintenance of maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes, that is infants through to second class, and 29:1 in senior classes, that is third class through to sixth class, over the three year period.</P>
      <P>The school in question is eligible to receive a supplementary grant aid of £2,479 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned in respect of the current school year.</P>
      <P>In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the new programme in respect of the current school year were determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 1999.</P>
      <P>The school in question was one of a number of urban schools considered for additional teaching staff under the new programme. It was deemed that the school had sufficient teaching staff already to implement the maximum class size guidelines of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes in respect of the current school year.</P>
      <P>Likewise, on examination of the enrolment in the school at 30 September 2000, it was concluded that the school had sufficient teaching staff to implement the maximum class size guidelines under the new programme for the forthcoming school year.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule that is formulated for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and six mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 166 pupils at 30 September 1999. The school has also been allocated two disadvantage concessionary teachers in addition to two learning support teachers, one special class teacher, one refugee teacher and one shared home-school-community liaison co-ordinator.</P>
      <P>On the basis of an enrolment of 189 pupils as at 30 September 2000, the school in question will gain an additional mainstream class teacher for the 2001-02 school year in addition to the staffing allocation for the current school year.</P>

      <P>The remit of the special project team, to which the Deputy refers, is to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students.</P>
      <P>This review, which is in progress, is a wide-ranging review covering many topics. These include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation.</P>
      <P>Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. For example, costings of the effect of changes in the income limits, below which applicants become eligible for a grant, have been commissioned and carried out for the special review. Notwithstanding this, I expect the review to be completed in the near future.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

      <P>My Department recently agreed a revised scheme of incremental credit for teachers with the teacher unions and managerial authorities of primary and second level schools. The details of the agreement for primary teachers are outlined in circular 10/01. Recently a copy of this circular was sent to the teacher referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If the teacher has further specific queries regarding the award of incremental credit he should contact the primary payments section of my Department directly in the matter.</P>
      <P>This Government has introduced a number of measures to facilitate teachers trained abroad in obtaining teaching positions in Ireland. Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. Its terms of reference were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and, in particular, the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of school bags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy school bags.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report with an accompanying circular to all primary and post-primary schools. Information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy school bags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department is looking at <Col N="248" /> ways of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no specific estimates allocation for the provision of lockers in schools. The provision of lockers was not a specific recommendation in the report of the working group.</P>
    <P>In relation to second level schools, my Department continues to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools, as recommended in the report.</P>

      <P>On the closure of Carysfort College of Education in 1988, 23 academic staff were seconded to the university sector as follows: 13 to University College Dublin; three to Trinity College Dublin; four to the National University of Ireland, Maynooth; and three to Dublin City University.</P>
      <P>In 1989, £650,000 was provided to the Higher Education Authority, the statutory funding authority for the universities, to cover the salary costs of the staff concerned. This funding has since been subsumed into the overall funding levels of the individual institutions and is not separately identified.</P>
      <P>Further funding of £2.4 million was provided in 2000 for the integration of the staff into the relevant university pension schemes.</P>
