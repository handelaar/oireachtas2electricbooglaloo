    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 to 28, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> On 21 September I attended an extraordinary meeting of the European Council which was convened to discuss and fully assess the implications of the terrorist attacks of 11 September on the United States. As I indicated in my statement to the House on 3 October, we agreed that the European Union would co-operate with the United States in bringing to justice and punishing the perpetrators, sponsors and accomplices of the 11 September attacks.</P>
    <P>We also agreed that top priority would be given to the introduction of a European arrest warrant, the adoption of a common definition of &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; and to implementing as soon as possible the full package of measures agreed at the European Council at Tampere in 1999. We further agreed that there is an urgent need throughout the European Union to identify suspected terrorists, terrorist organisations, or organisations supporting terrorists. All useful data regarding terrorism will be shared through Europol, within which a specialist anti-terrorism team is to be established.</P>
    <P>I had a working lunch with the President of the European Parliament, Ms Nicole Fontaine, on Monday, 15 October, with whom I had a very productive discussion on the broad European agenda. On Wednesday, 17 October I met the full European Commission. This meeting was preceded by a separate meeting with the President of the Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi. I had discussions with both President Prodi and the European Commissioners on the current European agenda, including the recent attacks on the United States, enlargement of the European Union, the likely work programme for the forthcoming Spanish Presidency of the European Union in 2002, the outcome of the recent referendum on the Nice treaty and the launch of the National Forum on Europe. I also raised with the Commission the current difficulties faced by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Following my meeting with the Commission I met the Belgian Prime Minister and President in office of the European Council, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, to discuss preparations for the Ghent European Council. Clearly, the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty is of interest to all our partners. As I previously stated in the House, I briefed the European Council in Gothenburg on the outcome of the referendum. I indicated then, as I have indicated at meetings since, including the meetings with the Commission, Madame Fontaine and Prime Minister Verhofstadt, that we are undertaking a period of national reflection before we move forward.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 19 October I attended the informal European Council in Ghent. Three Presidency declarations, copies of which have been laid before the House, were approved by the Council. These declarations relate to the follow-up to the 11 September attacks and the fight against terrorism; a review of the economic situation post-11 September and the preparations for the introduction of the euro.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> The Council commenced with a presentation by the President of ECOFIN, Minister Reynders, Commissioner Solbes, the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Wim Duisenberg, and the President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, on the introduction of the euro and the current economic climate. Preparations for the introduction of the euro are progressing well, although we noted that additional efforts need to be taken by both individual member states, ECOFIN, the European Commission and the European Central Bank to ensure small and medium sized enterprises are appropriately prepared. There was general agreement at the Council that the benefits of the euro could be seen in the lack of exchange rate tensions in the euro area. With regard to the economic climate post-11 September, we expressed confidence that the sound economic framework of the Union, and the fiscal consolidation already achieved, will help to ensure the economic impact of the attacks will be limited and temporary.</P>
    <P>We had a lengthy discussion on the situation post-11 September, and reaffirmed the Council's support for the military operations which began on 7 October and our determination to combat terrorism, in every form, throughout the world. We also recognised, however, the need for a humanitarian effort to assist the Afghan population, including refugees. In particular, the need to avoid civilian casualties was stressed. I raised with my colleagues the need for a flexible approach to assisting the aviation sector on the basis of effective viability plans.</P>
    <P>As regards other responses, we reaffirmed our commitment to adopting a proposal on the European arrest warrant by 6-7 December, although we recognised that the detail of this proposal needed to be drafted with care. We asked the Council and the Commission to prepare a programme to improve co-operation between member states on the evaluation of risks, alerts and intervention, and research on the threats of biological and chemical terrorist attacks. This programme will cover the detection and identification of infectious and toxic agents, as well as the prevention and treatment of chemical and biological attacks. A European co-ordinator for civil protection matters will be appointed as part of this programme. The future of Europe debate and enlargement were discussed over dinner.</P>
    <P>With regard to the follow-up to the Lisbon Summit, the Portuguese Presidency convened three informal meetings of Prime Ministers' advisers and the Commission between the Lisbon Summit in March 2000 and the Feira Summit in June 2000. Irish officials attended all of these meetings. This informal group or network discussed preparations for the Feira European Council and was instrumental in agreeing the conclusions of the European Council in Feira relating to the follow-up to the Lisbon Summit.</P>
    <P>With regard to progress to date in reaching the targets set at Lisbon, I refer the Deputy to my statement to the House on the outcome of the <Col N="1114" /> Stockholm European Council on the 29 March and my answers in reply to questions on this matter on 10 April 2001. As the Deputy will be aware, the Lisbon European Council agreed that the spring European Council meetings should address the economic and social agenda of the EU. At Stockholm we agreed to build on the very good progress we made towards achieving the target set at Lisbon of making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world by 2010. At Ghent, we reaffirmed the need to accelerate the implementation of the Lisbon agenda in the wake of 11 September and encouraged the European Investment Bank to step up its contribution by providing lending, particularly to infrastructure projects, to support the knowledge based economy and to help foster long-term investment.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the first meeting of the National Forum on Europe took place on Thursday, 18 October. The text of my inaugural statement has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and I do not consider it appropriate to make a statement on it.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference, which I have also laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, envisage that the work of the forum will fall into two phases. First, it will consider the implications of enlargement and the organisation of the future of Europe debate. It will then proceed to an examination of Ireland's overall relationship with the EU and issues relating to the future of Europe discussion. The overall duration of the forum will be a matter, in the first instance, for the forum itself. It is not intended, however, that the work of the forum would take an inordinate period of time.</P>
    <P>Six officials have been seconded to the forum, three from my Department and three from the Department of Foreign Affairs. At this early stage it is not possible to accurately indicate the projected cost of the forum. I will, however, be pleased to supply that information to the House once the costs have been identified.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach raise the issue of Sellafield and the new MOX plant proposed there at either his meeting with the Commissioners on Wednesday last or in the course of the Ghent Summit, either in plenary session or on its margins?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach confirmed that he raised the Aer Lingus issue at his meeting with the Commission. Did he raise it at the Ghent Summit? What was the reaction of his European colleagues and the Commission to the issue of the Irish State putting equity into Aer Lingus to save the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter, I did not raise it with my European colleagues. We are pursuing that now on a legal basis. It will be before the House later today and it was before the Cabinet today also. At this stage the European Commission is aware that, under European <Col N="1115" /> law, the Law of the Sea, Euratom and the OSPAR Convention, we are looking at taking legal action. On a number of occasions and the other night on the margins of the summit, I discussed it with some colleagues only to tell them what we are proceeding with. Of course I again mentioned it to Prime Minister Blair on Friday, just to inform him of what we are doing.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan said, I raised the issue of Aer Lingus, first, with President Prodi and his officials, then with the full Commission where there was quite a lengthy discussion on it, and again at the European Council. Of course Ireland is one of half a dozen countries which have such difficulties. A number of European countries are tied into the difficulties directly related to Swiss Air. The Greeks are also tied into those difficulties from other sources and so are some other countries. Each country has raised its position. There was debate, not on any one country but just on the difficulties of the sector. The Commission's view of course is its stated position on state aid. Its view is there should be co-ordination in aviation within Europe and, for that matter, within the United States. There are a number of Private Notice Questions on that matter later today. The Cabinet discussed the matter this morning and the Minister will report on that during her response to those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will appreciate that Sellafield is not only an Anglo-Irish issue; it is a European issue also. Does he agree that it may be considered insincere, if not down right hypocritical, that he would launch a strong attack on the British Government about Sellafield and then go to two major meetings in Europe and not raise the issue at all?</P>
      <P>On another topic, the Taoiseach is probably aware of the concerns expressed publicly by Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, about the fact that the French, British and German Prime Ministers had a meeting in advance of the Ghent Summit. Does he share the views of Romano Prodi that this gives rise to further concerns and feeds Euro-scepticism and a public view that the real decisions are being taken in committee by the larger countries and that the smaller states, including Ireland, are not party to the serious decisions being taken by the French, British and Germans?</P>

      <P>On the first question, my views and those of the Government are well known through talking to Energy Ministers and other colleagues. It is also well known that we have been involved in litigation on this issue for some time and are now pursuing it through OSPAR. It is not well known, however, that we are also pursuing it through the law of the sea and the European Union. It is not appropriate to raise these issues when discussing economic and other matters. Therefore, nobody would think it odd or <Col N="1116" /> hypocritical &ndash; in fact, people would wonder if it was raised.</P>
      <P>I share Romano Prodi's view about countries meeting in private session. However, there was much discussion of this before the meeting, and all the smaller countries &ndash; six of my colleagues &ndash; had an opportunity to discuss the issue and make their views known. At the commencement of the meeting the President said he had spoken with Germany, France and the United Kingdom as it had been reported that they had had a meeting. However, Germany was not involved in the meeting, but there was a meeting between President Chirac and Prime Minister Blair. It was made clear to the Presidency that this was a bilateral meeting about issues unrelated to the agenda. It was assumed that the ongoing military issues in Afghanistan had been discussed and that the meeting had nothing to do with the agenda items. It was also clear that nobody in the European Council wants to see people meeting for other than normal bilateral meetings, which happen all the time. For example, I have regular bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Blair and others on different issues.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that he and his EU colleagues recommitted to the concept of a European arrest warrant. Will he report on the discussion which took place before this occurred? How will it work in practice? Does it in effect mean that inter-community extradition treaties will be set aside and that it will be possible to arrest and take from one jurisdiction to that of another member state a person suspected of particular offences, and that the law in the other member state will take its course? Is it a substitute for extradition in relation to particular offences? Can the Taoiseach give an example of what would happen in this jurisdiction if such a warrant was exercised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This was debated at the meeting in Tampere over two years ago. There are many examples of extradition between countries not working particularly well. In fact, there are exclusions and legal and constitutional difficulties and even in the context of straightforward terrorist extraditions there are major problems. For a considerable time the removal of normal extradition procedures has been examined as there is evidence through Europol and the security forces in member states that terrorist groups use and abuse procedures and move to countries where they can get around extradition procedures. They can easily find a way round extradition procedures. Numerous terrorist organisations in the European Community locate themselves in countries from where they are unlikely to be extradited and successfully manage to manipulate the law in that regard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently listed during Question Time the organisations involved. On the other hand, there is a great reluctance on the part of a majority of countries to adopt new pro<Col N="1117" /> cedures which could be used willy nilly. There is concern that one could end up extraditing a person for an offence committed in one country but which would not be an indictable offence in that person's own jurisdiction. A majority of countries are opposed to this and it clearly would not work. I gave examples of where this issue could arise between here and member states, which would not happen.</P>
      <P>In terms of moving this issue forward, the Justice Home Affairs Council decided to endeavour before 6-7 December to look at co-operation in regard to categories of extreme terrorist offences or related offences, not minor offences. For example, a person who is involved in a major terrorist offence in France and then moves here could be extradited, but it would have to be a listed offence. It is on that basis matters are being moved forward.</P>
      <P>There is total support in a majority of countries for this proposal. However, there is also concern that it must be in line with the constitutional position of these countries. It is believed this is possible if the list of categories of offences is limited to serious offences. That could by-pass the extradition system and become a European arrest warrant for very serious acts.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his answers explaining the Lisbon process. My Question No. 6 relates to a slightly different matter, that is, a meeting of personal representatives of Heads of Government. I understand that at least six such meetings have taken place and that as of the summer of this year no representative of the Irish Head of Government attended any of the meetings to discuss the Lisbon process. I understand, to assist the Taoiseach, these meetings take place in the hotel closest to the airport in Brussels. Will the Taoiseach confirm that no representative of his attended any of these meetings? If so, will he indicate why, if the Lisbon process which concerns employment, employment development and competitiveness is being discussed at European level among representatives of Heads of Government, the Irish Head of Government is not represented?</P>
      <P>In regard to the plans for the forum, is it ruled out that the forum could propose, for example, a protocol to be added to the Nice treaty? I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that no change to the Nice treaty could be put forward at this juncture. Will the Taoiseach agree that a protocol being added to the treaty because it would have legal effect would, in effect, be a change? Will he confirm, therefore, that all the forum may propose in terms of improvement to the Nice treaty is a mere political declaration? Will he agree that if the French, British and Germans persist in holding meetings prior to summits, the answer would be for the remaining 12 member states to hold their own meetings separate from the French, British and Germans in advance of the summit in the same place, and soon the three would stop?</P>

      <P>I will answer the Deputy's questions in reverse order. If meetings were held by the larger countries that would get back to the argument about a two tier Europe and all of the other difficulties and would be, as always, resented by the smaller countries. That is not something we will allow to happen. Where there is co-operation between large and small countries it does not necessarily break down that way, but I reiterate that the concern was made clear through the Presidency and we were given a commitment at that meeting. The reason it got so much publicity is another question, but I have to take things at face value. The President said he checked the position and relayed the concerns of small countries, and what Romano Prodi had said, and that of the three countries reported in the European paper that morning as having this major meeting, only two had met and that it was on an unrelated matter. That is where these matters rest and I hope they will not continue to be raised.</P>
      <P>On the question Deputy Bruton asked about the Lisbon issue, as I said in my reply, officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs met during that period. That group was instrumental, as Deputy Bruton will recall, in agreeing a conclusion at the European Council in Feira following on from the Lisbon Summit, but the group was not convened again by the subsequent French, Swedish or Belgian Presidencies.</P>
      <P>Senior officials in both my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are in regular contact with their European counterparts and prior to the extraordinary meeting in September there was a meeting of Prime Ministers' advisers and permanent representatives. That happens on an ongoing basis. Specifically in relation to the Lisbon process, about which Deputy Bruton is anxious to know, a group was not convened after the Feira Summit. Ireland is represented at any formal and informal meetings convened under the auspices of the President of the European Union. I assure Deputy Bruton that senior officials in my office are in regular contact with their counterparts but if there are any other meetings of a group of countries, they are not formalised meetings to which we are invited or are part of, but we are certainly part of any of the other meetings. Deputy Bruton asked me another question.</P>

Is he further aware that any changes would require the convening of an intergovernmental conference to agree them? If so, why did the Taoiseach not warn his colleagues when he met them in Gothenburg that there was a possibility, as it now appears he is suggesting, that Ireland could be looking for changes to the Nice treaty before it asks the people to consider the matter again?

A press release was issued by the Belgian presidency following the declaration of the heads of state and government and the President of the European Commission. Regardless of the impact made by the Taoiseach on the relevant deliberations of the council and heads of government meeting, the press release contains no reference to the crisis in the European airline industry, nor a specific reference to Olympic Airlines, TAP, Aer Lingus or Sabena.

I was the first to contribute to the economic assessment. I probably spoke the longest and was surprised others did not have more to say. That is a matter for them to explain. The short note on the economic assessment did not refer to lengthy presentations by Wim Duisenberg, the president of ECOFIN and the EU Council of Ministers. The economic assessment by the monetary council, the ECOFIN council and the European Central Bank was that while there are difficulties ahead, in the medium to long-term and for the remainder of this decade, the fundamentals of the European economy would still hold good. Wim Duisenberg outlined that in his assessment and according to the ECB's examination of its inflationary model, inflation would fall to approximately 2% next year with interest rates of approximately 3%, producing real interest rates of approximately 1%. They consider this will provide the opportunity for robust economic growth but that it will take some months to get to that position.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Two aspects of the Taoiseach's initial reply prompt supplementary questions. What representations did he make concerning Aer Lingus during his talks with senior EU figures? How did they justify preventing the owner of Aer Lingus &ndash; the Taoiseach himself, on behalf of the people &ndash; from investing in his company? The Taoiseach has been engaged in a charade. The refusal of the European Commission to allow the Government to invest is a political decision, made by political leaders, governments and the Council of Ministers, with which the Government has gone along. The Taoiseach, therefore, is in no position to attack the European Commission because it takes its orders from politicians. The people are being treated to a charade, behind which the Government is trying to hide.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give details of his discussions with other EU leaders concerning proposals to restrict the civil liberties of EU citizens in the wake of the atrocities of 11 September? Is he aware that measures reportedly mooted at senior EU level go far beyond tackling terrorism and encroach on the area of mass demonstrations and protests? These are traditional methods of the trade union movement and anti-globalisation protesters to make political points. The peaceful occupation of a building or a walk by environmentalists on land while protesting against genetically modified crops could, under one definition I have seen, be regarded as terrorism. Is there a cynical agenda to use the tragedy of 11 September to criminalise various opposition movements within the European Union because they have become embarrassing to governments as they have grown in strength? Will the Taoiseach pledge to oppose any restriction of civil liberties along these lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question has been posed by two Deputies already today, but I will go back over the answer again. I had a lengthy and useful discussion with the President of the Commission and subsequently with the Commission as a whole, apart from two members who were at a meeting of the General Affairs Council. I addressed the Commission regarding the difficulties faced by Aer Lingus and it is extremely conscious of the turmoil in the aviation industry, particularly here. I made sure of that as did the Minister for Public Enterprise. As the Commission had approved an emergency rescue package for Sabena the day I was there, it was familiar with the issue. It had been discussed before I arrived. I pointed out that the fate of the national airline is a huge preoccupation here because of the central role of our access-transport policies. I stressed that Aer Lingus is facing up to the radical restructuring package that is emerging. The Government has adopted a prudent approach <Col N="1122" /> and does not unquestioningly contemplate a bale out. The restructuring plan is a genuine one and will result in a radically restructured airline based on commercial realities. I stressed to the Commission that our priority is to keep Aer Lingus viable. It is a major challenge, not least because of its exposure to the downturn in transatlantic routes, from which the airline takes 40% of its business and 60% of its profit. Its viability requires that the survival plan is agreed within the airline.</P>
      <P>I emphasise the need to seek approval for any measures proposed. We will ask the Commission to use its discretion and to be flexible, under the state aid rules, in its approval of a credible viability plan. The Commissioner with responsibility pointed out that the aid package for Aer Lingus would have to comply with the rules in question. Any discretionary treatment in favour of any airline would be successfully challenged by the courts. That has been indicated in the case of Aer Lingus, among others. We agreed that officials from both sides would keep in close touch and they have done so. We arranged a meeting for Friday morning, during which officials from both sides remained in touch. We were even in touch over the weekend.</P>
      <P>I share the view of Deputy Higgins that the events of 11 September should not be exploited for the sake of some bright idea by somebody trying to curtail civil liberties or some plan that has been around for a long time. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been at pains, therefore, to ensure constitutional positions in member countries are totally recognised &ndash; a point included in the conclusions of the meeting the other day &ndash; and that we deal only with issues that genuinely pertain to terrorism and problems that already exist. That is the current approach, which will continue in the next four or five weeks.</P>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Noonan, the kernel of the matter is that terrorists representing organisations which pose a genuine threat &ndash; the kind of people who would shoot someone for a penny &ndash; have been operating around extradition laws in Europe. An effort is being made to try to prevent them from doing so with such ease. It is well known where they go, the procedures they follow and how they evade the law. The effort is to try to make life a little bit harder for them and a bit easier for Joe and Mary Soap who want to go about their business and live their lives.</P>

No one person, group or organisation has all the solutions.</P>
      <P>We must now debate the referendum that was defeated. Equally, most people would say they are in favour of enlargement. We must find a way of ensuring Ireland is not responsible for restricting the ability of the European Union to enlarge. That is first challenge that faces us. Second, the issues concerning the future of Europe must be dealt with. They will be discussed at Lacken, where a debate on the kind of forum or foundation that is to be established will take place. An exact model will have to be determined. It is becoming clear what form it will take &ndash; it will be representative of the European Parliament, national parliaments, and outside experts. They will start work around Easter and work into the summer of 2003 for an intergovernmental conference, probably during the Irish Presidency in 2004. That is the process now being considered and which will be agreed at Lacken on 15 and 16 December.</P>

      <P>First, we have to look at what the people said in the last European poll. Ireland was still at number two in terms of its commitment to the European Union model. I will not discuss what the people had to say on certain issues because we know this already. We must endeavour to build up support through the forum, the House and its committees. It must also be done through Departments and agencies, political movements and organisations and the four pillars of social partnership along with other groups encompassed within those. There must be a debate where the benefits of Europe to Ireland are brought to light in a meaningful way, where what people interpret as disadvantages and problems are dealt with and where those people are convinced otherwise. That is a challenge in which we must participate. It is not all negative because people are still supportive for various reasons but the vision of Europe must be explained again.</P>

      <P>In the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Noonan, I was also shocked, but not quite <Col N="1124" /> surprised, to hear he did not mention MOX during his round of meetings. Does he agree that, whenever the subject of the war on terror is discussed, he should take the opportunity to raise the issue of Sellafield from an Irish perspective given the danger inherent in the transportation of nuclear fuel and the fact the plant itself is a potentially deadly target?</P>
      <P>How did the Taoiseach raise the Aer Lingus matter? Under what heading did it arise? Was it under security or was it economic or political in nature? Does he agree the issue should be raised whenever the issues of European integration and the democratic deficit are dealt with given the alienation felt by workers in Aer Lingus because of the cold shoulder the European Commission has shown to their plight?</P>
      <P>On the war in Afghanistan, has anyone raised the fact during meetings that a military staff committee to advise and assist the UN Security Council has not yet been established which, under Article 46, is to be established to advise on all questions relating to Security Council military requirements for the maintenance of international peace and security? Given that this committee has not been activated as required by the Charter, was any question raised as to the legality of the military campaign in Afghanistan which is being supported, apparently without conditions, by the Government and other EU member states? Is that to be raised with the United Nations and, given our position, with the United States to ensure there is a mark of legality on this war against terrorism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of Sellafield whenever there is an opportunity to do so, as there is regularly, whenever it is appropriate and whenever we have any dealings with the British Government. I have raised the issue of Aer Lingus and have stated four or five times what I said in that regard.</P>
      <P>No one questioned in any form the legality of the war. Most of the discussion last weekend focused on humanitarian aid, the EU programme and how to deal not just with Afghan refugees outside the country but those still inside it as well. The discussion also dealt with the logistics of supplying food and the need to work together to achieve as much as possible on the humanitarian front.</P>
      <P>On the structures for the future, the UN has appointed Ambassador Brahimi who now reports to the UN on the various structures. I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will deal with that again. The preparations for the structure and workings of a new administration are being made. These will be debated at a later EU meeting but there was excellent support at the previous meeting for the Ambassador and the difficult task he has ahead of him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Scrapie is not a new disease in sheep and has been recorded for over 200 years. Since 1990, scrapie has been identified here in over 120 flocks out of a national total of more than 40,000 flocks. My Department has been active for the past decade in the detection, monitoring and control of scrapie. Our approach has been guided in the first instance by public health considerations, has been developed within the framework of measures to address TSEs generally and has been based on the best available current scientific research and knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures taken by my Department over the past decade and relevant to scrapie are as follows: flock owners are obliged by law to notify my Department of suspected cases of scrapie &ndash; these animals are tested by the veterinary laboratory service and destroyed if positive; the feeding to ruminants, which include sheep, of meat and <Col N="1126" /> bone meal &ndash; MBM &ndash; has been banned since 1990, and controls in this area were significantly strengthened in 1996; and specified risk material &ndash; SRM &ndash; controls covering both cattle and sheep were unilaterally introduced in 1997.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, my Department has maintained a programme of active scrapie surveillance which involves the random testing of 8,000 samples at meat factories. Plans have been made to increase this programme to 15,000 samples with effect from 1 January 2002 and the necessary preparatory work has been in train for some time. An ongoing programme of research in areas such as strain typing, breed susceptibility and geographical distribution has been undertaken. A genotyping project, aimed at identifying the best means of breeding scrapie out of the national flock, has been undertaken since 1999. This involves assessing the feasibility of breeding-in genetic resistance to the disease.</P>
    <P>A national sheep identification system &ndash; NSIS &ndash; which involves the individual identification and traceability of the entire national flock was introduced in June 2001. This will facilitate more precise control and monitoring measures than ever before in relation to diseases, including scrapie, in sheep. Lastly, restrictions have been made on the movement of sheep from flocks in which scrapie has been confirmed.</P>
    <P>Against the background of these developments, the point has now been reached where it is considered that we should move to depopulate those flocks in which scrapie has been confirmed in the past three years. To date, 39 flocks have been movement restricted, 34 with a view to depopulation and five to be included in the scrapie research programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>My Department will be examining a further 87 flocks which were scrapie positive prior to 1999. Depopulation of the 34 flocks will occur as soon as possible after the valuation process has been completed and suitable arrangements are in place to compensate the flock owners affected by this decision.</P>
    <P>As and when new scientific research emerges which may indicate the desirability of adjusting or augmenting any of these measures, any necessary actions will be taken, as has consistently been the case heretofore. I would, however, point out that laboratory tests undertaken to date indicate that isolates of scrapie from Irish sheep are distinct from BSE.</P>
    <P>For some time there has been speculation about the possible outcome to research which has been under way in Britain into whether BSE might have been present in the British sheep flock in the early 1990s and masked by scrapie. It had been anticipated that some results might have been ready to present to the UK spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee &ndash; SEAC &ndash; on Friday last. DEFRA, who had commissioned the work, had also commissioned cross-checking research to guard against the possibility of <Col N="1127" /> material being contaminated by cattle brains. This cross-checking has raised considerable doubt about the validity of the original sample on which the research work relating to the early 1990s has been based. As a result of these doubts the SEAC meeting which was to have considered the results of the work was cancelled and the UK food standards agency has said that the doubts about the validity of the sample are such as to prevent it from being further considered in relation to the presence of BSE in sheep in the early 1990s. I might also mention that work has been undertaken by the UK veterinary laboratories agency to seek to establish whether BSE might be in sheep in Britain today. The results so far on 180 TSE-affected brains have not produced any evidence of the presence of BSE. The issue of TSEs in sheep will be discussed at today's meeting of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland is concerned, I am confident that the measures which we have already put in place, and which we are intensifying, are playing a valuable part in tackling scrapie in this country. While scrapie is of course an issue which Ireland and other countries must address, I believe that Irish lamb can, and will continue to, command the confidence of consumers at home and abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very interesting but we already knew that. Did the Minister take the trouble to read the question? What is the situation in relation to the 39 flocks under threat of depopulation? Has the Department changed its view as a result of the appalling fiasco in the UK in relation to research as to whether scrapie could mask BSE? Does the Minister of State have anything concrete to say to the 39 flock owners who wonder whether they should feed the sheep or arrange for depopulation to be carried out?</P>

Depopulation of the 34 flocks will occur as soon as possible after the valuation process has been completed and suitable arrangements are in place to compensate the flock owners affected by this decision.</P>
      <P>The second question asked relates to what happened in Britain. What happened there raised more questions than provided answers. We are confident that the measures being taken by the Department are adequate to deal with the problem. There is no clear information coming from Britain but it certainly does not create the link so popularly touted by the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State changed his view as to what should be done with the 39 flocks in view of what has transpired in the UK? What time frame is meant by as soon as possible? These 39 flock owners have been notified that their flocks are to be depopulated. Does that depopulation decision still stand and if it does when will it happen? They want to know exactly <Col N="1128" /> when because it is a matter of expenditure of large amounts of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to continue with the process. What has happened in Britain has not affected the system. The steps were in train before any announcement was made by Britain. It is still the policy of the Department to depopulate them. As soon as possible means as soon as possible after the valuation process has been completed. This is catch-22. We have to agree the valuation process and make the arrangement. As soon as that is done the arrangements to dispose of the flocks will be made. It would be foolish of the Department to depopulate the flocks before valuations have been arrived at with the flock owners. The Deputy would not suggest we do otherwise.</P>

      <P>My Department was in touch with the EU Commission about this problem well before June of this year. A formal written application to amend the State aid approval was in fact made on 4 April 2001, some months before the ceiling for payments was reached. Since then my Department has been in constant communication with the Commission services, supplying additional material as requested and addressing the various concerns that are always present when there is any question of raising the ceiling on State aids. Officials of my Department travelled to Brussels in September to ensure that everything had been supplied to the Commission's satisfaction and were assured that this was the case and that all that remained was to process the application formally through the different levels of procedures laid down for internal and inter-service consultation. This procedure closed at the end of last week and I expect to have the formal written approval within the next day or so.</P>
      <P>Just over 650 applicants await payment under this scheme. I have in previous replies explained that there is no provision for the payment of interest in cases like this. The Prompt Payment of Accounts Act referred to by Deputy Penrose is not intended to cover payment of grant aid which may be delayed for any number of reasons.</P>

      <P>This is scandalous. Is the Minister of State aware that some farmers borrowed money last autumn, carried out work over the spring and were then prevented by the foot and mouth disease problem from having inspections carried out? This was not of their own making. Now when inspections are carried out ten or 11 months later many farmers who borrowed as much as £10,000 or £20,000 are denied the grant. Does the Minister of State not consider it just and equitable that farmers in a situation not of their own making should be paid additional money because the figures on which the grants are calculated are below actual costs? In the interests of goodwill and in respect of the plight of farmers over the last 12 months should not the Minister of State ensure the grant and due compensation are paid? I know of a farmer who must pay £2,000 interest on top of the capital sum borrowed to carry out this necessary environmental work, which is lauded by all.</P>

      <P>Payments continued to be made until the end of May when the £15 million ceiling was reached. I do not presume that Deputy Penrose suggests that we do not comply with EU regulations. We must accept that there are delays in getting permission in this matter. As soon as permission is given, cheques will be issued, as I said, in a matter of days. It is not intended and not provided for that interest will be paid in such cases. The Deputy knows that as well as I do and if he was in my position, he would give the same answer.</P>

We sought two things, of which one was permission to pay on the national scheme. Regarding the EU scheme, which replaced it and over which the Deputy causes confusion by referring to it, we sought permission to speed up by avoiding 100% inspections because of the foot and mouth crisis. Our officials are still attempting to pass the scheme and deal with the extra workload involved arising from foot and mouth disease. To expedite the scheme, a second request was made to Brussels and in consideration of one Brussels asked questions about the other. We are trying to do all we can to speed up these payments and also approval under the new scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the current arrangements, which were agreed following the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the milk quota regime is to continue until 2008. In those negotiations I strongly supported the continuation of the quota regime. There were some member states, in particular the UK, Italy, Sweden and Denmark, which argued at that time for the abolition of the system.</P>
      <P>As part of the Agenda 2000 Agreement, provision was made for a mid-term review of the regime in 2003 on the basis of a Commission report, with a view to allowing the present quota arrangements to run out after 2006. It is now likely that the review will be brought forward to next year. It is to be expected that some member states, which were in favour of the abolition of quotas during the Agenda 2000 negotiations, will adopt a similar stance in the context of the review. However, any change to the current regulations can be made only if there is a qualified majority in Council in favour of such a change.</P>
      <P>When discussions on the review get under way I will, of course, seek an outcome which is best for the development of the dairy sector.</P>

      <P>I would not disagree with the views of the Minister of State. The mantra across Europe for several years was that the milk quota would have to be abolished. May I put it on record that, in so far as the Government is concerned, during the mid-term review and thereafter, every effort will be made with our EU partners to ensure the milk quota will remain in place, in some shape or form? I suggest that signal be sent out to our dairy farmers so they know what the future holds for them.</P>

      <P>It is the most commonsense way forward. If, after consultation with the farming groups, somebody can present a better way of doing it, so be it. I do not see that happening because it would mean that the stronger people in the market would take over and that the smaller farmers would lose out. If that were to happen it would be unfortunate for small farmers. It is a guarantee of protection and it is part of rural development policy to ensure that as many people as possible remain on the land. It is the only way forward that I can see and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has strong views on that issue.</P>

      <Quest>the reason, in the context of commonage framework plans, it is proposed that sheep numbers may not be increased on farms that include commonage land; the reason this proposed restriction would apply even in cases where the farmer is participating in the rural environment protection scheme and where the REP scheme plan allows more sheep to be maintained than the present number; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the REP scheme, commonage land is subject to a 1998 agreement with the European Commission following which the scheme was revised in 1999 to include a new supplementary Measure A. The objective of this measure, which is called Measure A in the new REP scheme, is to provide a comprehensive approach to the conservation and <Col N="1135" /> regeneration of designated target areas including commonages.</P>
      <P>It is important to recall that in 1998 there was so much concern about overgrazing on commonages in the west that the EU was threatening to put a stop to all REPS payments on commonages in Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry. In spite of this difficulty, my Department secured an agreement that allowed us to pay up to £190 annually per hectare on commonage to REPS farmers, not just in the six western counties but in every part of the country. Conditions attaching to these payments include an overall reduction in sheep numbers on commonages, to deliver environmental sustainability and, where necessary, regeneration of the commonage areas. This is to be achieved by the drawing up of a commonage framework plan for every commonage.</P>
      <P>As the preparation of framework plans for each commonage was a major exercise, an interim national framework plan was put in place to give immediate effect to the 1998 agreement and to allow for payments to be made to individual farmers. Under this interim plan, ewe numbers may not exceed 70% of the 1998 figures in the six western counties where the overgrazing issue was deemed to be most serious. Under the 1998 agreement any reductions in ewe numbers in other counties are determined by approved REPS planners when drawing up REPS plans. Quotas frozen under the interim framework plan will be revised to conform with the actual level of destocking that may be required under individual framework plans.</P>
      <P>Farmers in the six western counties who had joined REPS before the 1998 agreement on supplementary Measure A would have had their REPS plans drawn up and stocking densities calculated at individual farm level. However, the Measure A agreement requires the commonage overgrazing problem to be addressed globally and it is for that reason those farmers too, if they submitted amended plans after 1998 or applied to join the new REP scheme, became subject to the 30% interim destocking. Any quota frozen in their original REPS plans would, however, be taken into account in calculating the 30% in their cases. When all the commonage framework plans are completed and implemented, all existing REPS participants will be required to adjust their stocking levels to conform with the framework plans where this is a requirement of their REPS contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of £190 per hectare that my Department secured in 1998 includes compensation for reductions in stock. Therefore, farmers could not benefit from a destocking payment while at the same time increasing their stocking intensities. Under the terms of the 1998 agreement with the Commission, farmers with commonage were to have the choice of joining REPS or taking part in a national compensation scheme to be operated by the Department of Arts, Heri<Col N="1136" /> tage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Proposals for the latter scheme are with the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State do a little exercise? Will he get a tape recorder, switch it on, read the answer he has just read to the House and sit down and listen to it. It is pure gobbledegook. Will the Minister of State agree that what he is saying to sheep farmers is that they can do anything they like with their sheep numbers as long as they reduce them? Is the Minister of State in a position to indicate what will happen where there is a conflict between a REPS plan, validly drawn up, and the requirements of the framework programme? Which one will prevail in such circumstances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has suggested is an impossibility. It could not be a validly drawn up REPS programme unless it takes the interim framework plan into account. Such a conflict cannot, therefore, arise because one of the conditions of the EU scheme is that one must comply with the framework plans and the interim framework plan. In those circumstances, what the Deputy suggested is an impossibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. This matter came to a head in 1998 when the European Union not only threatened to stop REPS, but also headage payments and premiums on sheep. A deal was struck with the European Union to the effect that there would be a payment of £190 per hectare &ndash; approximately £70 per acre &ndash; in respect of commonages. At the centre of this matter was the issue of destocking, because farmers are required to carry out precious little other work on commonages. It was also further agreed with the European Union that, until the framework plans were completed, there would be a temporary scheme to destock sheep for which the required figure was fixed at an average of 30%. I understand the average across the framework plans for the six western counties is approximately 28%. The requirement was, therefore, quite accurate and it secured and maintained payments that farmers would otherwise have lost. Most farmers would agree that the benefits that accrued from the action taken at the time far outweighed the disadvantages involved.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that REPS II is choking on a froth of bureaucracy and that it is far too rigid in nature? Will he admit that he is disappointed by the uptake of REPS II and that he is not surprised by this? Is the fact that less than 70% of the farmers who participated in REPS I will participate in REPS II a result of the level of payment being too low or is there another reason for this significant decrease?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which Deputy Penrose refers is the subject of a reply to a later question. However, I will provide him with a brief answer. There have been 12,500 applications for REPS II which are being processed as speedily as possible. It is expected we will receive the greatest ever number of applications &ndash; 15,000 &ndash; for REPS this year. The Deputy's information is incorrect because there has been a high level of uptake on REPS II.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton because, at times, the fixation with commonages baffles me. However, the Department is obliged to comply with the rules laid down in agreements with the European Union. The agreement which applies here specifies &ldquo;all commonages.&rdquo;  We are trying to deal with the issues raised by the Deputy, one of which is that small areas of commonage used for common access to water are impinging, in many peculiar ways, on the REPS plans of the farmers who own them. We have drawn up draft proposals to deal with that issue. I have spent a great deal of time grappling with the issue of REPS regulations and their unforeseen effects. People did not fully understand the implications of the regulations when originally drawn up. I have spent more on this issue than on any other.</P>

      <P>The information available to me suggests that there is not a big backlog of cattle over 30 months of age on Irish farms. The major outlets for such cattle are the continental European market, Russia, the special purchase scheme and intervention. The quantity of beef being sold into the special purchase scheme is considerable and accounts for the vast bulk of the cows slaughtered in the country in recent weeks. Russia and the Netherlands are the main markets for over 30 month steer beef which can also be sold into intervention. In this regard, the quantity offered into intervention is entirely a matter for the beef processing industry. The Commission has accepted the bulk of the beef offered into intervention by Irish processors this autumn.</P>

Compared to this time last year, the figure for steers is up by 37,000, for cows it is down 2,000, for heifers it is down by 27,000 and for young bulls it is up by 7,000. Therefore, there has been a total increase of 15,000 in the number of animals slaughtered. It is acknowledged that there is a backlog in the number of cows available for slaughter, but the special purchase scheme continues to cater for increasing volumes of these animals. It is expected that the residual backlog will be cleared by the end of the year. At the end of September this year 100,000 cows had been slaughtered and accepted into the special purchase scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme for the period 1994 to 1999 included the use of land for public access and leisure facilities as a supplementary measure. My Department submitted agri-environmental proposals for the programme period 2000-06 to the European Commission under Regulation 1257/1999 on support for rural development. The proposal included the supplementary measure on public access. The Commission determined that the use of land for public access and leisure facilities was not provided for under Regulation 1257/1999 as a co-financed measure. I sought to have it included in the REP scheme as purely a nationally funded measure as a State aid. The Commission did not agree to this course of action. Arising from this, the measure could not be included under the current REPS.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the significance of walkways for tourism and as a leisure amenity for urban dwellers. In that regard, the concern of landowners needs to be taken account of. Accordingly, it is important that an appropriate funding mechanism is put in place so as to ensure that landowner costs including public liability insurance are provided for in so far as they relate to access to private lands encompassing walkways. The potential for sourcing of funding elsewhere than under REPS is being considered by my Department and representatives of the relevant tourism interests in the context of developing the operating strategy for rural/agri-tourism in the period to 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the bureaucratic recital I got that the Minister of State is saying that though this measure was proposed to the Commission as part of the current REPS, it was refused by the Commission on the grounds of the cited regulation or directive and that the Minister of State is now considering, with the tourism interests, whether it might not be carried out under another programme. Will the Minister of State give any indication of how long it might take to have that consideration done and whether such a measure might be in place for the main walking season next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part is no, it is not that easy just to say how and when it will come in but I take the Deputy's point to heart. It is very desirable that such a scheme be <Col N="1142" /> available for next year's walking season because it is a major concern both to those who walk the land and the farmers whose land is traversed. We will be working on this.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might call this bureaucratic-speak but it clearly outlines under what regulation the door was completely closed on the REPS route, which was the route everyone had availed of until then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pious words do not butter bread as far as those farmers are concerned. This matter is very topical in my constituency. Is the Minister of State aware that the farmers concerned are threatening to withdraw people's rights to traverse pathways on their land unless they are compensated? Unless the Minister of State comes up with a plan quickly, there will be a shock in store for tourists taking those walks next season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, we proposed to deal with this under REPS because that would be the simplest way to solve the problem. The matter is being considered because I was very concerned when this issue was raised with me and I wanted to find a solution for it. However, this is not just a question of compensation; it is basically a grant. It is not compensation; who are we compensating?</P>
      <P>Some people do not understand the dictionary definition of compensation. The Deputy is asking that payment be made to farmers for facilitating other people to walk across their lands. In that context if it was a direct payment it would come under State aid, I presume, so it is not that simple. We will work on this issue as quickly as possible. We will look at any possible angle to resolve it but I cannot give a guarantee here as I hate giving guarantees something can be solved until I have the thing solved satisfactorily. It is just not possible to do things that way. If I knew the answer today I would give it to the Deputy. He will know that it is difficult in this job to give timescales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider putting such a measure into the tourism context? Does he agree that it can at least be cogently argued and without any tongue in cheek element that we are talking here about tourism and not agriculture? On that basis might a different approach be taken that would not incur the wrath of the bureaucrats in Brussels?</P>

      <P>No. I have answered the Deputy's question but he obviously was not listening: &ldquo; . . . representatives of the relevant tourism interests in the context of developing the <Col N="1143" /> operating strategy for rural/agri-tourism in the period to 2006.&rdquo; That is exactly&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it has to be in agri-tourism. It must be in tourism which has to do with agriculture. Obviously, anything done in that context would come under the general remit of agri-tourism, as it is commonly called. The Deputy may call it &ldquo;tourism over farmland&rdquo; or whatever he wants, but it is being considered in the exact context he suggested. If he has any other suggestions for resolving this problem, I would be delighted to hear them. We are genuinely anxious to resolve it because it is recognised as a problem.</P>

      <Quest>the criteria under which the reopening of the Egyptian market is taking place; the likely impact of the reopening of the market for beef in the next six to 12 months in view of the 24 month limitation imposed on the age of animals for this market and the necessity to have such animals tested for BSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Egyptian authorities to provide for exceptions to the ban on European beef imports for countries which can meet certain conditions regarding BSE is a very welcome development for Irish beef producers. It follows on an intensive campaign by Ireland at political, diplomatic and technical levels to gain recognition for the way in which BSE is being dealt with here.</P>
      <P>In general, the Egyptian authorities have indicated that they will permit beef imports on condition that the beef is derived from cattle aged less than 24 months from which the specified risk material has been removed. Furthermore, those cattle must be fully traceable, test negatively for BSE, never have been fed ruminant MBM and only come from farms in which no case of BSE has occurred in the past three years. The Deputy will be aware that BSE controls in place in Ireland in recent years mean that the Egyptian requirements relating to traceability, BSE testing, MBM, etc., are fully met by our existing controls. As regards age, the fact is that a similar condition is not new within the Egyptian requirements and, as with all such conditions, much will depend on how it is applied in practice.</P>

      <Col N="1145" /> Contacts are taking place in Cairo between importers and the Egyptian authorities on matters relating to certification, specification and terms of supply. I understand a number of applications for import licences have already been submitted to the Egyptian authorities. The question then of competing for contracts is a commercial matter for the exporters involved and it is not feasible at this stage to speculate on the likely impact of the reopening of the market in the next six to 12 months. I am, naturally, hopeful that Irish exporters will compete to regain the level of market share they enjoyed in recent years.</P>

What steps would his Department and Teagasc, in particular, take to change the methods of production to ensure there is an integrated beef system which finishes with two year old animals to comply, as the Minister of State said, with the conditions dictated by the market? What steps will he, his Department and, in particular, Teagasc take to ensure we are in a position to fulfil the market conditions and the criteria now laid down?</P>

      <P>As I said, the market conditions imposed, apart from the additional ones on BSE and ruminant feed, are no different from what was in place or in the Iranian market previously. It is an improvement. As I said previously, there were 114,000 tonnes sold there in the first nine months of last year until the foot and mouth disease crisis and the cases of BSE in Germany and France particularly upset us. The major issue here, apart from sales which will be ready for this market, is that it is a signal to other markets that they are happy with our method of traceability and the way we handled BSE.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national and international importance, namely, the threat posed to Ireland by nuclear weapons in Britain and on British submarines, and the legal and diplomatic measures the Government needs to pursue to bring about the disarmament and decommissioning of these weapons of mass destruction, so it will not be necessary again for my colleague, Patricia McKenna, MEP, to be arrested in doing her job and which the Government is failing to do.</P>

      <P>It is now widely accepted around Leinster House that there will be a statement from the Provisional IRA at 5 o'clock, with the customary P. O'Neill signature. Has the Taoiseach advance information of the contents of the statement? Is the conventional wisdom correct that this will indicate that the IRA has again engaged with General de Chastelain with a view to putting arms beyond use?

      <P>While we all welcome the developments that seem to have taken place over the past number of days, will the Taoiseach outline to the House in his reply the steps that need to be taken to ensure that the institutions are not suspended by the end of this week and if it is his understanding that the Ulster Unionist Party led by David Trimble will meet with General de Chastelain some time later today to obtain from him an up to date report as to what action, if any, has been taken by the IRA? Can one reasonably assume that the message that will be conveyed to the Ulster Unionist Party will be of a sufficient scale and import to enable it to announce that it is prepared to go back into the Executive?</P>

      <P>The statements yesterday from the leadership of Sinn Féin have clearly been helpful. I have not seen any text nor am I aware of the text of what will be issued later this evening, but the important issue is the statement by the chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, General de Chastelain, and until I see that statement, we will have to remain cautious but optimistic. That statement will reply to what Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn have asked, namely, will it allow us not only to move on without seeing the collapse of the Assembly, the Executive, the North-South Bodies and the other mechanisms within the Good Friday Agreement but to see them get a new lease of life so that matters can move forward in an unhindered way? It is a year to the day since the North-South Bodies ran into difficulties, but I ask everybody to wait until they see General John de Chastelain's statement. It is important that statements are not made before he reports. While he has not confirmed he will report I presume he will do so later today. It is for him to judge whether it is in line with what we hoped to achieve in early August. If his statement is positive I assume there will be movement on the issue of the institutions and that there will be new life in the procedures that have not worked effectively since the last week in October of last year. I cannot be any more helpful until I have seen General de Chastelain's text. Given that he is independent, I have not contacted him and I do not want to put any more pressure on him or his colleagues than is right for me to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that a number of arrangements have been made in the background. Is it the understanding of the Taoiseach and the British Government that any move by the Provisional IRA in the direction we hope will be accompanied by a parallel move by loyalist paramilitaries? In his discussions with Sinn Féin, has the Taoiseach raised the issue of the standing down of the IRA as distinct from decommissioning? It appears to many of us that an army without arms is the ultimate paradox. Does he agree that if the IRA is moving on decommissioning is it not time to commence discussions on the complete standing down of that organisation and the progression of Sinn Féin to becoming a fully democratic party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can move forward and get the institutions working, normal politics will work. No agreement has been made with the loyalist parties as part of any discussions that have taken place. It is to be hoped that the British Government will ultimately be able to persuade them to decommission their weapons. I hope the Secretary of State will continue to try to make progress in this area but it is not linked. However, <Col N="1155" /> other issues are linked and these were discussed last July. They include demilitarisation, advancing the stability of the institutions, which is linked to this aspect, and the policing agenda, where substantial progress has been made although more is required.</P>
      <P>I have discussed the issue of the standing down of the Provisional IRA many times. On at least two or three occasions Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have said it is their wish that, ultimately, the peace process will reach the stage where the provisional army would not only be inactive but that it would no longer exist in any form. However, we must continue to work to achieve that. This means ensuring the aspects which prevent it from happening, be it demilitarisation, the events in the Ardoyne area and tensions in other parts of north Belfast and on the Garvaghy Road, must be addressed. People must see that these difficulties do not persist. In the meantime probably the most we can do is to ensure that guns remain silent and that people are not involved in targeting or other activities. We must continue to work to achieve the stated position of the republican leadership, where there will be no army, structures or paramilitary activities.</P>

      <P>Three months ago, 96 haemophiliacs affected by contaminated products from foreign owned pharmaceutical companies asked that the terms of reference of the Lindsay tribunal would be extended to enable the tribunal investigate. In reply to a question by Deputy McManus today, the Minister for Health and Children indicated that he is considering what action to take in the light of the decline by the chairwoman of the tribunal to accept that the terms of reference would be broadened to include this. Will the Taoiseach indicate if, at today's Cabinet meeting, the Government made a decision on establishing a new tribunal and, if so, when will the decision be communicated?</P>

Will he also indicate if it is the view of the Attorney General that these are reasons which inhibit her from extending them?

      <P>In answer to a question from Deputy Quinn a fortnight ago I indicated it was the Government's intention to see if it was possible, with the agreement of Ms Justice Lindsay, to amend or extend the terms of reference of her tribunal to allow the issues arising form the international dimension to be addressed. She has given the reasons she does not consider this to be <Col N="1156" /> compatible with what she is doing, or desirable. The legal reasons have been stated and circulated. I will ask the Minister to pass a copy to Deputy Noonan.</P>
      <P>The Government is now considering how to proceed. If I recall correctly, 95% of the blood products were international, so clearly there is an outstanding issue.

By the end of this month the depository of documentation in Pensacola, Florida, will be effectively returned to the pharmaceutical companies and the documentary evidence which will be critical to any such inquiry will no longer be available. Will the Taoiseach confirm that an application from Ireland for that documentation would be successful only if it could point to some form of action that would be taken in this State, such as a new tribunal or an extension of the existing one? Will he also confirm that time is rapidly running out, that if we are to get to the truth of what happened in this instance we have less than seven days to file a formal request with the authorities in the US to ensure essential documentation is not destroyed, lost or becomes unavailable and that for legal action to have a prospect of success there would have to be a Government decision on a form of inquiry that would enable due process to investigate into the documentation? The Taoiseach does not have a couple of weeks in which to make a decision, it must be made in the next three of four days. What does he propose to do?</P>

Has the Taoiseach clarified which Minister is to sponsor this legislation? I thought it was to be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for tabling the questions. We said last week that we would debate the matter today. As I indicated in the <Col N="1165" /> House last week, the survival plan broadly confirmed the key details already known to the House in relation to the financial crisis in Aer Lingus, including the cash crisis it faced in</P>
      <P>January 2001.</P>
      <P>The company is losing £2 million per day, forecasting losses of over £60 million in 2001 and £120 million in 2002, and likely to run out of cash in January 2002. The survival plan sets out to build a robust, flexible business model to ensure long-term viability. The new model will be capable of competing successfully in a fundamentally changed marketplace, taking account of the 25% reduction in its scale of operation. Its focus will be to retain the premier business service together with the simplified economy and leisure product.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has also indicated that it does not have the cash to pay for a redundancy programme and, accordingly, an external source of non-repayable funding is required. Aer Lingus management held a series of briefings with union representatives and staff last Friday, 19 October. The staff were advised that, following the actions taken to date which include the scaling back of operations by 25%, the reductions in temporary staff numbers, the elimination of non-essential capital expenditure, and the significant reductions in overheads, the new business model would require the full implementation of the plan to ensure a successful future for the airline.</P>
      <P>Last week in the House I dealt in detail with the outcome of the Transport Council and the minimalist emergency aid being provided for airlines to compensate for the four day closure of US air space following the events of 11 September. I also mentioned that a team of officials from my Department was to meet the European Commission to brief it on the general aviation situation as it pertained to Ireland and on the Aer Lingus restructuring package.</P>
      <P>Arising from that meeting, it is clear that, as of now, the European Commission is opposed to the State providing support in any form to Aer Lingus. The Commission officials were unyielding in their restrictive view of state aid rules. Any funding by the State for Aer Lingus would be considered a state aid and the Commission would open the necessary investigative procedures which could take a minimum of 12 months to complete. The Commission was also quite clear that only private sector investment could be contemplated to secure the future of the airline.</P>
      <P>I reported to Government again this morning on the current situation in Aer Lingus. The Government decided in principle that, provided the survival plan is agreed rapidly and implemented in all its essential aspects, it will facilitate private sector investment in Aer Lingus to provide a source of funding to support the survival plan. The Government also decided that it would be open to the staff of Aer Lingus to invest further in the airline.</P>

I also requested him to urgently arrange for negotiations between management and unions on the measures in the survival plan. Central to those negotiations will be the matter of the necessary redundancies and the compensation payments to be made by the airline in this regard.</P>
      <P>While I wish to see negotiations on these matters begin and proceed with all urgency, the scale of redundancy payments cannot be finalised without reference to the stake in Aer Lingus which external investors may be interested in purchasing and on what terms. The focus of the Government is to secure the future of Aer Lingus and as many viable jobs going forward in the airline as possible.</P>

They will be out of a job but their redundancy payments will be undecided. Many will have mortgages and an uncertain future. Can the Minister give any word of consolation to those 2,026 workers?</P>
      <P>On the facilitation of private sector investment in Aer Lingus to provide a source of funding to support the survival plan, are talks ongoing or have they taken place with British Airways or American Airlines? What is the asking price for such a part-ownership? Is it £150 million, £200 million or £300 million? What percentage of the company does that entail? Is there a guarantee that the bulk of this money will be put towards adequate redundancy payments for those unfortunate 2,026 workers?</P>

Does she also agree that she has failed the country, the House and the workers who will lose their jobs? Will she return to the EU and reopen negotiations and not lie down meekly as she appears to be doing and accept the answer she has received? I appeal to her to fight for the survival of our airline.</P>
      <P>What power does the Minister have to allow a percentage of the company to be sold? Will she have to introduce legislation? What regulation under EU rules allows her to match any third party investment, something she said to one of the newspapers? Will she spell that out in detail?</P>
      <P>Is it true that there is a reference to outsourcing in the viability plan which management says will not contribute to the viability of the company? Will the Minister insist that that element of the plan be removed because it is giving rise to great concern among those members of staff who will see their jobs outsourced without any improvement in the viability of the company? Will the Minister give a commitment that the assets of the Aer Lingus pension fund will not be sold to whoever might buy part of the airline? They should remain available to provide just and humane pensions to existing and future pensioners of Aer Lingus.</P>

It acted like Pontius Pilate when it agreed the survival plan in principle provided it is rapidly agreed and implemented in all its essential aspects by the staff. This plan, which envisages 2,036 redundancies and the outsourcing of the catering and cleaning section and of 800 employees, will have no effect on the viability of Aer Lingus. Staff are requested to accept this plan. What is the alternative if they do not accept it? Is the Government prepared to do what it should have done already? Is it prepared to take on European bureaucrats particularly since the effects of the events of 11 September? Will the Minister confirm the names of the officials who negotiated on her behalf? Is one of those the senior official from the Department who said on public record that he was in favour of the privatisation of Aer Lingus and that was the direction it should go? If this Government is so concerned about Aer Lingus why was the matter not raised by the Taoiseach at Ghent last Friday? The least he could do is deal with the issue and take on the bureaucrats rather than selling Aer Lingus for such a small amount. He must take on the issue and respond to the need instead of doing a Pontius Pilate act and leaving it up to the workers. He must accept his responsibility. Aer Lingus and its staff have been let down by Fianna Fáil and the Government should accept that.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recall supporting and voting last week for a motion that contained the words, &ldquo;recognises that a change in the ownership of Aer Lingus is not now an issue in the current circumstances&rdquo;? What has changed her mind since then? She withdrew the Bill for the privatisation of Aer Lingus last week. Now she tells us that Aer Lingus has to be privatised to pay for redundancies. How much does she expect to get for 35% of Aer Lingus in what could only be described as a fire sale &ndash; damaged goods arising from the Minister's inactivity and actions against Aer Lingus and its interests over a long time? Given that she wanted to privatise Aer Lingus the week before last, to retain it in public ownership last week and to privatise it this week, will she confirm that she does not know what she is doing and has not a clue what is happening in Aer Lingus or at the European Commission? Would she have Government support for taking definite clear action to provide Government funding for a redundancy plan for Aer Lingus to allow the survival plan be put into place? Would she do so in defiance of the European Commission, if necessary? Will she take on the Commission in court, where the Government <Col N="1171" /> would win? Would the Government support the Minister in taking that positive action to save Aer Lingus? Does she agree that if she now has a fire sale for Aer Lingus, it will no longer exist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter with the Taoiseach earlier and welcome the opportunity to raise it with the Minister for Public Enterprise. Does she agree that this issue between the Government and the European Commission is as least as important as corporation tax and the Minister for Finance's own concept of good budgetary practice or at least his ego on the matter? Is there not now more of an argument to twist the Commission's arm on allowing State aid for Aer Lingus, given that she can cite Article 87.2B of EU regulations which allows for state aid in exceptional circumstances? Is she prepared to defy the Commission over this? As has been asked already, would she go to court over it? The USA precedent should be tested, even in a free trade area like the European Union. Will she defy the Commission, or will she roll over and accept that it has a different point of view? That is what it comes down to. There will be no redundancy payments unless she pushes the Commission, as she has admitted. She must answer this.</P>
      <P>Has she advised management of Aer Lingus, in discussing redundancies, to consider the measures adopted by Delta and KLM? They are not so drastic in terms of redundancies, but offer a shorter working week, job sharing and other proposals which address the humanitarian and human dignity aspects of this crisis, which is having a devastating impact in the Dublin, Cork and Shannon regions.</P>
      <P>Many Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners are worried about the pension funds. Are these separate funds outside the arguments raised by the Commission? As the pension funds need extra funding, will the Minister argue that they fall outside the State equity issue affecting Aer Lingus? Can the pension funds be augmented without regard to the free trade or other neoliberal agendas? Will the Minister reassure pensioners on this point so as to save them further cause for concern apart from their low incomes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we had the opportunity to raise questions with the Minister here approximately two weeks ago, my colleagues and I asked if an agreed written Government position would be taken to Europe. If a strong agreed written Government position had been put to Europe we would have a very different result from that with which the Minister has come home. Does she regret that the case was dismally made in Europe? Did she make any case regarding the fact that 60% of the profits of Aer Lingus in 2000 were based on the transatlantic routes and that the circumstances of 11 September specifically affected the transatlantic routes? Did the Minister argue that the Government should be allowed to provide cash to Aer Lingus specifically in relation to its losses on the transatlantic routes as the American Government did to the American airlines, where $5 billion in cash and $10 billion in loans was provided, including to those which compete directly with Aer Lingus on the transatlantic route? </P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that a very good case could have made to put cash into Aer Lingus, specifically regarding the losses directly related to 11 September and with regard to competition with American airlines on the transatlantic route. Did she make the case to the Commission that Ireland is an island nation and that strategically Aer Lingus is hugely important in that regard? From what we have heard it seems the case was dismally made in Europe. A very strong case directly related to the conditions laid down by the Commission with regard to the exceptional circumstances of 11 September, which resulted in the loss of transatlantic business, could have been made on the basis of figures on profits with Aer Lingus in previous times. A case could have been specifically made for a cash injection for the company as happened with American airlines on the transatlantic routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears what the Minister has come back with is a rubber stamping of a plan brought out by Aer Lingus management without consultation with workers and without real consideration for the conditions that the Commission had asked Governments to address. Following up on questions from other contributors, will she go back <Col N="1175" /> and make a proper case to have cash put into our national airline so that she does not have to do a complete U-turn on what she said last week when she said she would not privatise? Now she has come in here and said she is going to privatise. There is a case to be made and the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government should make it properly to Europe. They have not done so and it is about time they did.</P>

      <P>Let me finish. I gave the Deputy a hearing and I expect she will give me a hearing. I spoke on seven separate occasions during the course of that day. This was on top of the earlier meetings when I had been in Brussels and my meetings with Ms de Palacio. I made my major intervention. I had a written case. I do not read everything absolutely word for word but I had a strong written case. When I met the Commissioner at 9 a.m. I went through four points, namely, that we are an island nation, the only one in Europe; America had given direct aid to two direct rivals of Aer Lingus on the transatlantic route, therefore there was a huge distortion of competition; Aer Lingus's main money, when it makes money, is from the transatlantic route; and that the Government wished to put cash into Aer Lingus. Those were the four main points but they were all expanded. The Deputy may check with any Minister she may know from her affiliated party in any of the other countries that I made a very strong case.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the commitment she has given to Shannon and the Government for its repeated commitments regarding the transatlantic stop-over at Shannon. The Minister will be aware there is grave anxiety among the staff at Shannon about the impact of the difficulties. I welcome the responsible way in which the union leadership has dealt with the matter up to now. It is of critical importance that there would be the closest co-operation between the Department, the unions and Aer Lingus to ensure the survival of the company. In the aftermath of 11 September, the Government, under the Taoiseach's office, set up a committee to look at the impact of the events of 11 September on the economy generally. We in the mid-west are anxious to have some representation on that committee or that a task force for the mid-west should be established.

      <P>I wish to ask four brief questions. With reference to the four-day closure of the north Atlantic route, has the Government sought permission from Europe to put money into the company regarding that route, and if so, how much, and what is the timescale? Is EU permission required to do that? In regard to the future of the company, the Minister said it is likely to run out of cash in January 2002. Can the company continue to trade until then? Can it continue to fly and remain in business until then? Is the Minister talking about early or late January 2002? On the question of external investment, how much is required to keep the company in operation? Will she need permission from Europe and will more negotiations be necessary <Col N="1177" /> to allow that to happen? Did EU officials justify not allowing the Government to match in any shape or form the state aid which the United States Government has given the American airlines and, if so, what reason was given to the Minister? Is the Minister aware of the status enjoyed by Cork Airport and of the vital importance of Aer Lingus to it? Is she also aware the industries in the area, which she recently visited, will be devastated if Aer Lingus goes out of business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. All industries throughout the country will be devastated if Aer Lingus goes out of business. Nothing is more certain.</P>
      <P>With regard to the four day closure, to date what the EU has said is that the amount of money involved will be approximately £6 million. That money can be given because the circumstances are regarded as exceptional. To return to Deputy O'Sullivan's point, I made the case that everybody did not return to the air after four days and that the exceptional circumstances are ongoing and are not once-off in nature.</P>
      <P>In respect of the company's future, the chairman has informed me that it is now trading recklessly. He is of the opinion that this cannot continue. I stated this in the House last week and I reiterate it now&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The justification was that circumstances in the US and Europe are different and that the former is entitled to run its industry as it sees fit. A complete distortion has emerged in this regard because I provided figures two weeks ago which showed that Continental and Delta received almost $500 billion in cash aid. We do not know how much of that money was invested in the airlines' transatlantic routes. However, these airlines, which are direct competitors of Aer Lingus, received direct cash aid.</P>
      <P>Cork Airport enjoys a high status. If we can resolve matters involving Aer Lingus, I am sure it will continue to do so. Many companies in the area are hugely dependent on the airport, which has grown tremendously and which has a structural plan in place.</P>
      <P>The cargo facilities offered by Aer Lingus on transatlantic routes &ndash; I am sure the company provides such facilities on European routes &ndash; are also extremely important. These facilities are regarded as vital both by the airline and by the customers it serves. If Aer Lingus went out of business, the 1,500 workers employed by FLS, which refurbishes the company's aircraft, would be immediately affected.</P>
      <P>Everyone recognises that there are a number of issues at stake here. We must concentrate on arriving at a resolution to this problem which will allow the airline to continue in operation and which will sustain as many jobs as possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate the outcome of the case she put in Brussels in respect of the damage that has been done to Aer Lingus in the aftermath of the events on 11 September? What investment has been sanctioned by the Government to offset the effects of 11 September? What case did the Minister put forward in respect of the other exceptional circumstance which arose this year, namely, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, and which had a huge impact on the company? Did she obtain permission from Brussels to invest in the company on foot of the latter argument and what was the extent of that permission? Was she given the go ahead to make a loan only on the basis of the impact of 11 September or was she given permission to make a loan on the basis of the exceptional circumstances which arose in relation to foot and mouth?</P>

      <P>Deputy Shortall inquired about the case I put forward in respect of foot and mouth. I explained clearly to the EU that particularly exceptional circumstances had arisen in Ireland in relation to foot and mouth disease in the spring and early summer of this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made use of the term &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo;. Everyone in the House agrees that the crash into the twin towers was unbelievable. Aer Lingus's trading position was fine until 11 September. It was working its way out of the difficulties caused by foot and mouth and the downturn in the IT industry. What happened on that day, however, turned the world upside down, particularly for the aviation industry. The Deputy said that we are using the events of 11 September in a particular way. I am not using it. I did not invent what happened on 11 September and it is appalling to say that I am using what happened on that day.</P>

        <b>:</b> In essence the Minister's final comment seems to be that this was a perfectly good company until 11 September and now she is prepared to throw it to the wolves. What is the estimated value of the company? If one is to sell something, one must have a notional price. What is the Minister's price expectation in relation to the company? In this context the 35% element is very important.</P>
      <P>What is plan B? It is not a great time to sell an airline. Suppose nobody is interested or meets the Government's price expectation. What is the fall-back position then? Is the Government prepared to go ahead if it does not get the price? Surely the airline will not be sold for £50 million or £60 million or £100 million. If the Government does not get the price, is it prepared to make the necessary capital injection, in defiance of Brussels if necessary, and face the legal consequences? To hell with it: meet them in court.</P>
      <P>Finally, in relation to a point raised by Deputy Shortall, State companies are too serious to become an honours system for loyal party hacks.

We are told by her that cash will run out in January and that after January we will face a loss of £120 million in 2001 and £125 million in redundancies. Nobody believes that cash will come from a private investor. Nobody believes that £245 million will come from a private investor to cover the losses in 2001 and the redundancy package. Is the Minister trying to convince us she has an investor that will come and pay that money in order that the company can get to the end of 2002? After Aer Lingus runs out of cash we are hoping that some investor will come up with £245 million just to get to the end of 2002. Is the Minister trying to convince us that that will happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Minister's last point, she has said about ten times that she wants the staff to negotiate quickly, to use her word, on the viability plan, but how does she expect staff to negotiate when she stated, &ldquo;While I wish to see the negotiations on these matters begin and proceed with urgency, the scale of the redundancy payments cannot be finalised without reference to the stake in Aer Lingus?&rdquo; Is she asking the trade unions to negotiate how the viability plan is to be put in place in the abstract and without having the slightest idea about how much money will be available to pay them or the level of redundancies? How can she put that forward as a realistic option to the staff of Aer Lingus who were obliged to make the Cahill plan work and will be required to make this plan work also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has any consideration been given in the <Col N="1184" /> viability plan to allow for winter leave in order that good staff are not lost? Finally, if the Minister wants co-operation from the staff, will she instruct Aer Lingus to remove the outsourcing element of the current viability plan, given that management stated, through Mr. Walsh, it will contribute nothing to the viability of this plan? I am quoting him fairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The winter leave issue was not put to me, but I put similar matters to the chairman last week. As I told Deputy Sargent when he raised the matter, the chairman undertook to look at all issues which would help to secure viability in various ways. I will certainly add this matter.</P>
      <P>I dealt with outsourcing in an earlier answer. I know it is causing great anxiety. It is included in the survival plan put to me.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen asked about negotiating in the abstract. When I met the trade unions last Wednesday evening I told them that, as a general principle and based on the assumption of a negotiated redundancy package, talks should begin and it was agreed to proceed on that basis, but the redundancy payments remain an assumption until we can find a source of income for them.</P>

      <P>Are we to accept that the only result of all the negotiations, including the Minister's solo run across the Atlantic Ocean at a cost of £80,000 to Brussels and all the negotiations in Europe, is that the funding for the rescue package will ultimately come via a third party investment? Are we also to accept that the staff of Aer Lingus, some of whom have given 35 years' service, are to accept that the shareholder is not in a position even to pay redundancy, that they must agree to the sale and privatisation of the company? That is the net effect of what the Minister said.</P>

      <P>I indicated I wanted to ask a question, but unfortunately I had to leave for a few moments. I am obliged, therefore, for the opportunity.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that, in the event that part or more than half of Aer Lingus is sold to a private investor, particularly a One World Alliance investor, the overwhelming likelihood is that in one year Aer Lingus will be providing a few flights to New York and a shuttle service to somewhere in Britain. Does she not agree that that would be a pretty sad way for the national airline to end up?</P>
      <P>Let me pursue further the questions put by Deputies Bruton and Higgins regarding the capitalisation of the company. It seems, based on any reasonable assessment of the capital value of the company, that it is unlikely that the sale of up to 30% or 40% of the company will provide sufficient moneys to enable the Minister to bail out the airline. That being so, I invite her to explicitly guarantee to the House that the State will maintain a majority shareholding in the company.</P>

      <P>On money, to answer both the Deputy and Deputy Bruton, the losses will be over £60 million within two months, if there is no change, and £120 million in 2002. The company is likely to run out of cash in early January 2002. However that is predicated on the fact that none of the changes laid out in the survival plan would be put into effect. My wish is that, with the survival plan which management presented to the workers last Friday, everybody will work together to get a decent solution to save Aer Lingus in order that the company will move forward as a healthy airline, but that will not happen if we all continue to be negative. I understand the position of the representatives from the areas concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to allow international banks based in Ireland and domestic banks and mortgage providers to access international capital markets on the most competitive terms and in doing so to underpin the strength of the Irish financial system and the continued attractiveness of Ireland as a base for financial institutions. To do this, the Bill provides for the introduction of new financial instruments &ndash; the asset covered securities of the title &ndash; by Irish institutions into the euro zone market. These securities will be backed by assets held by the institutions concerned, in particular, mortgages and public sector loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> The Irish asset covered securities will be similar in nature to the famous German <i>pfandbriefe</i> securities. These <i>pfandbriefe</i> are the largest single bond type in Europe. They allow German institutions to access finance on exceptionally good terms, with consequent knock-on benefits for the strength of their financial system and the availability of credit. In recent years other European countries have taken the view that their institutions should also be able to access this source of funds. For example, France, Spain and Luxembourg have introduced enabling legislation to facilitate the issuance of these types of securities.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Bill is that asset covered securities issued by a financial institution will be statutorily secured on a pool of underlying assets held by the same financial institution. These underlying assets are primarily mortgages or public sector loans. The key feature of the product is the enhanced security offered to the holders of the securities. Because of the reduced risk to investors, it will be possible for financial institutions to borrow more cheaply and easily. In the event of the insolvency of the issuing institution, the cover assets must be used first to meet the claims of the holders of the securities. Ordinary creditors of the institution may not make a claim against these assets until the full obligation due to the investors in the securities has been discharged.</P>
    <P>The enhanced security afforded by the preferential creditor status, the specification of strict matching of assets and liabilities and the regulatory environment for the product have resulted in the German <i>pfandbriefe</i> attaining a triple A credit rating and becoming an extremely popular investment. The establishment of an asset covered securities market under Irish law will assist in the further development of the international financial services sector here, provide a new and efficient form of financing to domestic financial institutions which will enable them to remain competitive in the European market and help to underpin domestic capital markets.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, securities similar in nature to the proposed product have long been a feature of European capital markets. They are longest established in Germany where they have a demonstrated history of 125 years. No issue has ever defaulted. Asset covered security markets are also long established in Austria and Sweden. As I have already mentioned, other European countries have introduced enabling legislation in recent years to facilitate the issuance of similar securities.</P>
    <P>The availability of asset covered securities has contributed to stability in the continental European markets due to their long-term primarily fixed rate nature. Their high credit rating enables issuing institutions to raise long-term funds at interest rates only marginally higher than those of a sovereign borrower. Of course, this confers a significant competitive advantage. Introducing this type of bond into Ireland will allow Irish <Col N="1188" /> based banks and building societies to take advantage of this cheaper funding source and ensure that they are able to continue to compete against other European credit institutions within the Irish and the broader European markets.</P>
    <P>Enabling legislation is required to allow Irish credit institutions issue asset covered securities because the legal basis for the new securities must be clearly established. It is also necessary to provide a legal framework for the level of regulatory supervision required to ensure the product conforms with the highest quality standards of other similar bonds available in the European markets.</P>
    <P>I would now like to set out the key features of asset covered securities. Asset covered securities are securitised bonds. They are secured on a pool of high quality assets. However, in a conventional securitisation the bond is secured on a defined and unchangeable set of assets which are removed from the issuing institution's balance sheet. By contrast, asset covered securities will be secured on a pool of assets called the cover assets pool. These assets, even when put into the pool, remain on the issuing institution's balance sheet but are ringfenced. This means that, in the event of the issuing institution getting into financial difficulties, these assets must be used to meet the institution's obligations to the holders of its asset covered securities before they can be used to meet the claims of any other creditors.</P>
    <P>The most important feature of the cover assets pool is that it is dynamic in nature. This means that non-performing or redeemed assets may be replaced in the pool by new assets. In this way the high quality of the cover assets pool can be maintained. It is this dynamic feature of the cover assets pool allied to the conservative management of the pool which enables institutions to obtain high credit ratings and to issue asset covered bonds at low interest rates.</P>
    <P>There are two distinct types of asset covered security. The first is a public credit covered security. These securities are usually issued by specialist banks whose main activity is the provision of finance to Governments, municipalities and local authorities. The securities are primarily backed by public sector assets such as sovereign bonds, local authority loans and Government guaranteed loans. The second type of asset covered security is a mortgage covered security. These securities are usually issued by institutions whose main activity is the provision of mortgages. These securities are primarily backed by mortgage assets.</P>
    <P>Public credit covered securities are, at all times, secured by a pool of assets of at least equal nominal value and yielding at least equal interest. Mortgage covered securities are similarly secured, but based on a very conservative valuation of the assets concerned. The ultimate investors in asset covered securities are normally institutions wishing to hold high quality securities offering a modest yield premium over comparable Government securities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of asset covered securities <Col N="1189" /> will greatly assist the financial services sector in the new era of EMU, globalisation, deregulation and new technology. It will remove the structural disadvantage which could otherwise affect Irish capital markets through the undercutting by foreign financial intermediaries of the rates offered by their Irish counterparts. The mortgage sector is probably the best example of what I am referring to here. The advent of the euro with its consequent elimination of exchange rate risk, the mutual recognition of credit institutions throughout the EU and the advance of e-commerce which will enable institutions to penetrate a market without establishing a branch network all pose particular issues for the domestic mortgage sector. Such a situation could allow foreign institutions to cherry pick customers and provide increased competition to the domestic mortgage sector.</P>
    <P>Of course this is not a bad thing and I am all in favour of competition in this area. However, I do want to ensure that the domestic mortgage sector is well equipped to compete. Specifically we need to ensure that domestic institutions are enabled to raise funds on terms similar to foreign institutions which are in a position to raise capital through the issue of their own mortgage covered securities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of mortgage covered securities will enable Irish mortgage institutions to raise funds more efficiently and to compete with their European counterparts. They should also facilitate the introduction of more attractive and longer term fixed rate mortgages which will provide greater security for borrowers.</P>
    <P>The issue of public credit covered bonds is a more specialised operation. It is likely that issuance of these bonds will be mainly concentrated in the IFSC. The Government is committed to maintaining a vibrant and growing international financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC and further boosting employment in the sector. To do this we need to be proactive in providing the environment which will attract new business here. The enactment of this Bill will do precisely that.</P>
    <P>By enabling the issuance of these new securities, the Bill will also help to underpin our bond markets as a whole, including the market in Irish Government bonds. With the advent of EMU the Government has had to adapt to a situation where it is no longer a monopoly supplier in a small market but one of the smallest of 12 competing issuers into a very large one. The passing of this Bill should result in a significant increase in the volume of Irish bonds in circulation. This will make all Irish bonds more attractive to large institutional investors and will assist in maintaining activity in the Irish market in times when the State is not issuing bonds. This will help to ensure that there is significant investor demand for all Irish bonds. In short, this product is one which presents advantages to the industry, the State and the consumer.</P>
    <P>I would now like to describe for the House the <Col N="1190" /> main features of the Bill. It provides for the establishment of designated credit institutions, i.e., designated mortgage credit institutions and designated public credit institutions which may issue securities under the terms of the Bill. Designations must be approved by the Central Bank and only credit institutions already regulated by the bank may apply for designated status. The sector will be regulated by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains restrictions on the types and amount of business activity other than core mortgage or public sector lending in which designated credit institutions may engage. This is to ensure that designated credit institutions engage only in conservative lending practices.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains detailed provisions on the issuance of asset covered securities. These include the issuance by designated credit institutions of mortgage or public credit covered securities secured on mortgage credit or public credit asset pools; specifications on the type and location of assets which may be included in cover asset pools. It should be noted that to provide some flexibility and diversity in the cover asset pools, the legislation allows up to 20% of the pools to consist of high quality assets other than mortgage credit or public credit assets; and specification of requirements for matching of securities and cover asset pools with respect to duration, principal, interest and currency and allowing for the use of hedging contracts in this regard.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Bill is the appointment of a cover asset monitor by a designated credit institution to supervise the assets pool. The cover asset monitor acts like a trustee on behalf of the holders of an institution's asset covered securities. His or her role is to supervise the detailed operation of the cover asset pool. The institution must obtain the consent of the cover asset monitor before including items in the cover assets pool in order that the monitor can verify that the assets to be included are permitted assets, conform to the valuation criteria for the asset class and ensure none of the prescribed limits on any of the asset types is breached.</P>
    <P>The key provision of the Bill and the basis on which asset covered securities are issued is the provision of preferential creditor status to the holders of asset covered securities. This is dealt with in Part 7 of the Bill. It provides that the insolvency or potential insolvency of a designated credit institution does not affect the claims and rights of the holders of asset covered securities issued by the institution. In the event of insolvency, the cover assets pool will continue in operation until such time as the claims of the holders of the securities have been met. Only then will excess assets, if any, be distributed to the other creditors of the institution.</P>
    <P>Other features of the Bill which should be mentioned are as follows: the setting out of detailed measures to ensure an institution's obligations to the holders of its securities continue to be met in the event of the insolvency of the institution or <Col N="1191" /> the revocation of the institution's designation; the reciprocal recognition between Ireland and other states of priority of claims similar to those provided for in the Bill; and the amendment of the Building Societies Act to enable building societies to issue securities under the Bill, to enhance their powers to fund through the issue of securities generally and to ensure the rights of members are not adversely affected by these changes.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Bill treads a balance between conservatism and innovation. On the conservative side, the Bill is clearly modelled on the German <i>Pfandbriefe</i> legislation. This is because of the German model's long and successful history, its market acceptance and the volume of securities in issue. It is expected that the similarity of the product to the <i>Pfandbriefe</i> will assist in its quickly gaining market acceptance.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill also contains some innovative features which address issues raised by credit rating agencies regarding the operation of asset covered securities markets generally. These features should help in gaining high credit ratings and ready market acceptance for the Irish product. They include specific interest rate risk management requirements, express powers to enter into hedging contracts to manage risk and clear provisions on what happens if an institution gets into financial difficulties. Much effort has gone into making the Bill a state-of-the-art product and I very much see it as a flagship to launch Irish based asset covered securities and make them competitive in the wider European market.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the euro is leading to the development of an integrated and competitive capital market in the euro area. Mortgage and public credit covered securities are now becoming a standard feature of European markets. They are a recognised asset class in their own right and attractive to long-term institutional investors. They offer financial institutions the prospect of raising funds in a cost effective manner and, as a consequence, can have a substantial and beneficial impact on competitiveness. We are now part of the European mainstream and must compete in the wider euro area capital markets.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable Irish lenders to finance their activities as efficiently as their European counterparts and demonstrates the Government's commitment to the further development of Irish capital markets and the IFSC. It introduces a product for which there is a proven market demand and which has benefits for the industry, the State and the consumer. I, therefore, commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the Asset Covered Securities Bill, 2001. While the Bill is technical in nature, running to 100 sections, quite complex and complicated &ndash; I am sure it would take some of the financial wizards to get through its intricacies &ndash; nonetheless, Fine Gael will be supporting it through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition is the order of the day in the provision of financial services. Too often mortgage <Col N="1192" /> companies based in this country do not provide the type of competition that should be provided. However, the introduction of a company from abroad in recent times brought about real competition in the mortgage market and a reduction in the levels of interest payable, which is welcome. Many young people who take out mortgages for new houses are not fully aware that there should be major competition between the various mortgage companies. Many take on mortgages without realising that if they shop around they can get better value. I experienced this approximately three or four years ago when the financial institution with which I was dealing for a long time offered me terms on the purchase of a property. When I further investigated the matter to get competition I found that I could get far better returns from a different institution. When I went back to my regular financial institution with the figures I had obtained I was amazed that it could come forward with figures that were starkly different from its first set of returns that would be needed by me. This is something perhaps ordinary borrowers rather than big time borrowers are not fully aware of. Many mortgage companies provide a level of mortgages at interest rates which are not competitive. Perhaps one of the messages we can send out today is that if one is seeking a mortgage, one can shop around and get competition.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill will put Ireland in a better position to offer lower mortgages across the board. I might be a bit foolish in thinking mortgages will come down dramatically as soon as the Bill is introduced. Nonetheless, it will help to make lending institutions more competitive and will, I hope, stem the flow of capital out of the country. As a lot of capital is leaving the country to European markets, perhaps the availability of more secure funds will help to keep some of it at home.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Central Bank will play a key role in scrutinising applications of institutions which wish to operate this bond system. It is good that the Central Bank will play a crucial role in the financial affairs of this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill which the Fine Gael Party will support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read the Bill I thought it was pretty dry. To say the least, it is one of the driest Bills on which I have had the good fortune to comment in my time as finance spokesperson for my party. Having read it a second time, I confirm that view. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that it is a Bill of some importance to financial institutions, but potentially mortgage holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill effectively sets out the basis for refinancing by financial institutions. In the past Irish building societies, in particular, have refinanced on the basis of retail deposits, but more recently they have done so on the basis of mortgage backed securities or securitisation. I had the opportunity to discuss this issue yesterday with some of the Minister's officials. Following that meeting they gave me a note stating that the level of securitisation in this country is now quite sig<Col N="1193" /> nificant and, more particularly, that of approximately 3 billion of mortgage asset holdings now securitised, approximately 2 billion has been securitised in the last two years. As I do not follow the financial markets to the degree that I can say whether that should be the case, I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's explanation of the reason that is the case. It seems if that level of mortgage holdings or the holdings of building societies is being securitised, it must surely have some impact on the rights of building society members or members of mutualised societies.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State makes it clear that the Bill does not affect the rights of members of building societies or mutualised societies. I find it difficult to understand how that is the case. If one thinks about it in the context of securitisation, effectively what is happening is that the institution is disposing of its income stream and the right to the mortgage payments. Surely that must have some impact on the rights of the person or the mortgage since the mortgage is now, in effect, held by a different institution or, alternatively, held by a different body established specifically for the purpose in the interest of securitisation. As I cannot see how the rights of members are secured in those circumstances, I would like to be reassured by the Minister of State that that is the case. That question should be approached both in the context of the existing securitising mechanisms and in the context of the<i> Pfandbriefe</i>, the legislative basis for which is set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State pointed out, this is, in effect, setting out a new option for refinancing as far as the Irish context is concerned, but it is interesting to look at the experience in the rest of Europe. The total level of <i>Pfandbriefe</i> held in Europe currently, which I understand is about 600 billion, is enormous. Most of this is held in Germany or the Nordic countries &ndash; Denmark and Sweden &ndash; where the experience generally has been fairly positive. In recent years different variants of <i>Pfandbriefe</i> have been introduced in France, with the <i>Obligation Fanciers</i>, and also in Spain, Austria and Luxembourg, as the Minister of State pointed out. There are different features in different countries. I agree that the Minister of State has managed to strike a reasonable balance between the more conservative and more innovative options. I would have gone for a somewhat more conservative option than the one the Minister of State has chosen, which I will go into later if I get an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Going back briefly to the point I made about building societies and mutualised societies, it is probably fair to say that whereas two or three years ago many members of building societies would have been happy to troop along to AGMs to vote away their rights and effectively demutualise the companies and transform them into banks, the experience of those building societies which have been since transformed into commercial banks is such that I am not sure that enthusiasm would still exist. The recently demutualised building societies have been quick to go down the <Col N="1194" /> road of the banks in restricting services to customers and closing down branches, which those of us fortunate enough to be members of mutualised societies very much appreciate. Having the non-profit motive at the centre of those societies confers certain advantages which the recently demutualised bodies do not have.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves the reason we are introducing this Bill. We are primarily introducing it to facilitate foreign lending institutions, probably located in the IFSC, which will probably do most of their creative lending abroad, but there is also the possibility, as Deputy McGrath rightly pointed out, that it will be used by domestic institutions, building societies in particular. That could and should have some benefits down the road for Irish mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>We should emphasise &ndash; those of us who support the European project do not do this often enough &ndash; that since the introduction of the euro in 1999, albeit as a virtual currency, the average rate of interest here has come down considerably and with it the average rate at which mortgages are repaid. That said, the interbank rate, which currently stands at 3.75% within the euro area, is still a clear two to two and a half points lower than the rate generally charged, even for fixed rate mortgages over a relatively short period of time. There is still some scope, therefore, in that range of 2% to 2.5% for mortgages to come down further. This instrument should facilitate Irish building societies in being able to access cheaper money on a more reliable basis over a long period of time. As a result, I hope it will be possible for them to provide lower fixed rate mortgages over a longer period of time. If they do, this Bill will have been a success and will be of some benefit to individual mortgage holders, something which we all want.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister of State said in relation to facilitating the IFSC. Unlike my colleague, Deputy Stagg, as a 21st century social democrat rather than a 20th century socialist, I am happy to facilitate the capital markets and the IFSC in so far as we must do so, albeit something that does not fill me with any great enthusiasm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>He would regard that as a compliment. I would be interested to know the reason the German banks in the IFSC appear to be so anxious to get into this particular market based in Ireland since it is possible for them, through their parent companies based in Germany, to do more or less the same work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, there are three issues in dealing with this nature of security. The first is the nature of the security we are giving bond holders. That is critical. In that regard the Minister of State has gone for the highest possible level of legal security. That is probably a good thing because from <Col N="1195" /> what I have seen of the experience in countries where they have gone for a lower level of security, the market simply has not taken off. That is true, for example, in countries such as Austria. It is right, therefore, that we are giving the highest possible level of security to bond holders. There is a difficulty with this, however, in so far as it means that if one does not have that level of security and is rated as an unsecured creditor, one is very much down at the bottom of the heap and stands to gain virtually nothing in the unlikely event that a financial institution that issues these bonds goes bust. I am reassured, as the Minister of State's officials told me yesterday, that within the complex of the Central Bank there is a structure whereby individual depositors are safeguarded against these extraordinary circumstances.</P>
    <P>The second issue is the composition of the asset pool. In that regard the Minister of State has been a little risqué in allowing, for example, for the substitution of assets and the holding of public credit in OECD countries other than Ireland up to the extent allowed in the Bill. As long as the limits contained in the Bill are properly enforced &ndash; that assumes that they are enforceable &ndash; I imagine that will command the confidence necessary to get the level of credit rating that it needs. If it does not, then it will not get the credit rating and will not work. It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The third question is whether this operation should be carried out by specialised banks. I know this has been and continues to be a major issue in other countries such as Germany, where <i>Pfandbriefe </i>were effectively invented and are a major part of its capital markets. The Minister of State has chosen to go the middle road in so far as he said that existing credit institutions may seek to be specially designated. I am not sure if that is the right approach to take in this instance. There is an argument for saying that two, three or four institutions should be designated which will specialise in this type of bond. That is the approach taken in some countries, particularly eastern European countries, and it would have merit. There is an argument for a measure of conservatism given that we are dipping our toes into the water for the first time.</P>
    <P>The issue for us in relation to any of these types of product is how we regulate them. The issue of Central Bank regulation is one that has come up in the House in recent years on a number of different occasions. The layers of responsibility which the bank has have been added to and are being added to again in the Bill. The Bill emphasises yet again the need to get in place soon the single regulatory authority which will be able to deal with these diverse levels of regulation.</P>
    <P>The position of the cover asset monitor is critical. We have to emphasise that this individual, company or set of individuals must be in a position to have the information needed, not just to oversee, but to effectively manage the assets and ensure the assets which are comprised within the <Col N="1196" /> assets pool meet the strict criteria set down in the Bill. If the credibility of the monitor is not established or if he or she cannot do his or her job or does not have the legislative wherewithal to do the job, the whole system will collapse like a house of cards.</P>
    <P>I want to reflect briefly on the bond market generally. As the Minister of State is aware, when the euro was introduced as a real currency in 1999 we all expected that it would produce a major shake-up in the bond market and might effectively eliminate the demand for Irish bonds altogether. I understand that what has happened since is that most institutions which hold bonds are now doing so on a portfolio basis and that Irish bonds will typically make up 1% or 2% of the market. Obviously, that is as much as we can reasonably hope for in the circumstances. In 2000 the NTMA refinanced Irish debt by reissuing bonds. Having said that, it has not issued any bonds this year. I will be interested to know from the Minister of State if it intends to issue bonds between now and the end of the year or in the first quarter of next year. We should not look to issue bonds just to maintain the liquidity of the market, which sometimes the NTMA looks to do, but have to maintain the position in the market which ensures there is a market for Irish bonds in the event that we need to engage in Government bonds in the future.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting Bill, one that provides an important part of our financial infrastructure, but there are regulations and safeguards without which, to all intents and purposes, the Bill would be worthless. It is essential, therefore, that the supervisory mechanism and the monetary position be defined carefully in a way that ensures it gets the ratings required and makes the impact we want in the financial markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The plant at Sellafield has been an ecological and environmental disaster for the Irish people. As long as the plant continues to operate in our shadow, it will be a constant bone of contention between Britain and Ireland. The battle to close this obnoxious industrial dinosaur should be a diplomatic and legal priority for every <Col N="1199" /> Irish Government. The terrorist outrage committed in New York and Washington on 11 September has brought into sharp focus the threat that the continued operation of Sellafield brings to this island.</P>
      <P>Until 11 September the ongoing criminal pollution of the Irish Sea and the real danger of a nuclear accident at Sellafield were our main concerns. Now, after the 11 September attack, we must take into account the real possibility that Sellafield will become a target for terrorist attack. The consequences of such an attack would be disastrous for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The motion has two aims. First, it rightly draws attention to the abject failure of the Government to vigorously pursue BNFL and the British Government over the Sellafield plant. Second, it proposes a ten point plan of action which the Government should adopt if it is serious about closing Sellafield.</P>
      <P>An as yet unpublished EU report on the Sellafield plant, which I have seen, makes frightening reading. Its conclusions are stark. A serious accident at Sellafield will result in the deaths of over one million people from cancer. An explosion in the waste tanks would result in a human and environmental catastrophe 40 times worse than Chernobyl.</P>
      <P>The report is also damning of the non-compliance of the UK authorities with aspects of the EURATOM treaty. It makes clear that the terms of the OSPAR agreement are being comprehensively breached by the BNFL plant. It concludes that the emissions from the Sellafield plant, together with emissions from the Cap de la Hague facility in France, correspond to what it terms &ldquo;a large scale nuclear accident every year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>BNFL's safety record is a tissue of lies and deceit. The company is driven only by profit. It has taken enormous risks with safety at the plant. Its record is so bad that it cannot be trusted, now or in the future. Sellafield is our inheritance from the nuclear industry, an industry that has caused horrific environmental and human damage since its inception. The murderous power of nuclear energy was laid bare for everyone to see when the American air force dropped two nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Over one million innocent men, women and children were vaporised by these two bombs. The military-industrial complex that drove the development of nuclear technology boomed in the following years. An arms race, which devoured billions of pounds throughout the decades, thrived while the most appalling poverty claimed millions of lives every year. The lunacy of it was summed up by the epigram that described the strategic stand-off between the superpowers: MAD, or mutual assured destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With weapons development, nuclear power plants were foisted on the world by the industry and compliant governments. The lies and deception that have characterised the operation of <Col N="1200" /> Sellafield are an integral part of the nuclear industry from day one. Industry claims throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s that clean, free energy was on the horizon are just one example. We now have a proliferation of nuclear power stations which produce neither free nor clean electricity. These stations produce waste which can neither be stored safely nor neutralised. Science cannot deal with it. The nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979, Windscale in 1957 and Chernobyl in 1986 destroyed any remaining confidence in the industry.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is our legacy from this corrupt and disgraced industry. It is a real and present danger to the Irish environment and people. Any serious accident or attack on Sellafield would have lethal consequences for this country. Our largest industries, especially tourism and agriculture, could be virtually wiped out overnight. Our environment could be turned into a nuclear no man's land for centuries. The human tragedy that continues to this day for the people of Chernobyl and beyond would become a daily reality for our surviving citizens. That is the reason every Irish Government has a moral and national duty to oppose the operation of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The British nuclear industry has limitless resources and its capacity to lie is well known. A sustained campaign such as that outlined in the Labour Party motion this evening is necessary to tackle BNFL. This Government has singularly failed to lead that campaign. It has walked away from the task. The weasel words of recent weeks will not hide its failings. At the 2001 Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis the Taoiseach chose his Friday night opening speech to launch a broadside against Sellafield. He left us with the stirring words &ldquo;This issue will not be allowed to rest. The campaign to close Sellafield, to stop the MOX plant in its tracks, is only begun&rdquo;. However, those of us with an abiding interest in this issue can remember the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis of the previous year. At the exact same point &ndash; his Friday night opening speech &ndash; the Taoiseach called for the closure of Sellafield, saying &ldquo;I believe enough is enough&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the intervening 18 months what action has the Taoiseach taken to back up his well crafted words? Has he embarked on a diplomatic mission to unite EU opinion against this pernicious plant? In the 18 months between his grandstanding at the árd fheiseanna the Taoiseach has done nothing. He is content to let the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, bear full responsibility for the campaign. The Taoiseach has never taken Sellafield seriously. He cynically uses the issue each year to whip up the troops at the árd fheis and then carefully files away his indignant words until the next meeting of the soldiers of destiny. He has signally failed to back up his eloquent words with concrete action. His commitment to this issue has been characterised by hypocrisy and the cheapest form of populism. That is one of the first things that must change if our campaign against Sellafield is to have a real international impact.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> Since entering office in June 1997 this Government has been responsible for the complete downgrading of our legal and diplomatic efforts against Sellafield. It has taken two disastrous decisions which have effectively neutered our opposition to the plant. As this motion highlights, the Government disbanded the team of scientific and legal experts established by the previous Government and which led to success in blocking the planned underground nuclear dump at Sellafield. It followed this retrograde step by downgrading the inter-ministerial working party on Sellafield and allowing inertia to become its hallmark. These decisions have not just been noticed by anti-nuclear campaigners in this country and elsewhere. They have been noticed in the boardroom of BNFL and around the Cabinet table in Downing Street. The word has gone out that the Government is not serious. It will huff and puff on the appropriate occasions, but that is as far as it goes. Since this Government came to office BNFL believes it has got off the hook. It knows Fianna Fáil is soft on the nuclear issue in general and on Sellafield in particular.</P>
    <P>As a trenchant opponent of the nuclear industry for many years it was my privilege to be involved centrally in the Government's successful campaign against the Nirex dump. The Nirex dump was essentially the proposed construction of an underground nuclear time bomb beneath the Irish Sea. We fought tooth and nail against that project. Not only did we want to stop the development of the dump, we also wanted to send the message loud and clear to BNFL and the British Government that the future for Sellafield did not include expansion or development. The decision to halt the Nirex dump was a bodyblow to BNFL and the operation of Sellafield. I, as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and my officials learnt a lot through the Nirex campaign. We recognised the need to build links and relationships with other campaign groups, especially international groups, in the ongoing campaign against Sellafield. We recognised the importance of continuous research and monitoring of the Sellafield plant and the manner in which international law impinged on its operations. We also realised that a genuine international coalition, particularly involving countries in the Nordic Council, could be formed to fight the battle against the British nuclear industry, especially against Sellafield.</P>
    <P>This Government has forgotten each and every one of the lessons learned during the successful Nirex campaign. One of its first actions was the disbandment of the scientific and legal team that was central to presenting the Government's case against Nirex. The inter-ministerial working party on Sellafield has practically fallen into abeyance. One Minister of State, with a limited staff, scant resources and a diverse brief, has been given control of our efforts against Sellafield. His senior Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has shown more interest in decommissioning the semi-State sector <Col N="1202" /> than decommissioning the Sellafield complex. The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, cuts a lonely figure, especially on the international stage. His isolation sends the clear message to the British nuclear industry that the Irish Government is not serious. It is only going through the motions.</P>
    <P>The Government's record on Sellafield has been disastrous. Through its negligence and incompetence it has taken the pressure off BNFL. The Taoiseach has avoided taking a leadership stance on the issue. The Government's lethargy is responsible for putting back our campaign against Sellafield by years. The ten points detailed in this motion are intended to reconstruct a vigorous campaign against the plant. It is clear the Government has no idea how to proceed in light of the MOX plant decision. The Government has never outlined as comprehensive a plan as that detailed in this motion. Its record indicates it would not know where to begin. The Government should swallow its pride, recognise its failure and adopt the plan put forward this evening by the Labour Party. A multi-faceted plan such as that presented this evening is needed now more than ever. The threat this country faces has increased inexorably since 11 September.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment to this motion is pathetic. It is nothing more than a face saving exercise designed to cover the incompetence of Government policy to date. It should be withdrawn to allow the House to unite in acceptance of the Labour Party motion. Our motion outlines a co-ordinated programme of legal, diplomatic, scientific and political action that would bring all our resources to bear on the operation of the Sellafield plant. It would reverse the inertia in which the Government has wallowed since 1997. By rejecting it Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are, in effect, walking away from the Sellafield issue. It is a cowardly and disgraceful stance for any Government to take. It is a stance that will only find favour in the boardroom of BNFL and it will be punished seriously by the people when they eventually get the chance to cast judgment on this appalling Government.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Stagg, for sharing time with me and I congratulate him for presenting this Labour Party motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events of 11 September have made more urgent and more real the threat posed by Sellafield. A plane could crash into the Sellafield complex, a bomb could be dropped on it from the air or an employee or a visitor could take explosives into the plant in a suicide attack. A missile could be launched into Sellafield from the back of a lorry, just as the IRA launched a rocket at Whitehall. These possibilities are no longer the apocalyptic worries of anti-nuclear campaigners. They are very real and call for immediate measures to put a ring of security around Sellafield to protect it from terrorist attack from the air, from the sea or from land. The frightening <Col N="1203" /> implications of a major accident or attack at Sellafield are indicated in the STOA report which was submitted to the European Parliament in August. It states:</P>
    <P>The risk potential of certain hazards at Sellafield is very large. Liquid high-level water currently stored at Sellafield contains about 7 million TBq (2,100 kg) of caesium 137, which is about 80 times the amount released through the 1986 Chernobyl accident. Assuming a 50% release of caesium through an accident at Sellafield, population dose commitment would range up to tens of millions of persons-Sv resulting in over a million fatal casualties.</P>
    <P>An immediate cessation of reprocessing would still leave enormous quantities of nuclear waste stored at Sellafield. Even its closure would still leave this continuing risk, against which precautionary security measures must immediately be taken. The most immediate requirement, therefore, is for the UK authorities, in consultation and agreement with this State, to put in place a security strategy to minimise the risk of terrorist attack. It is astonishing that in the aftermath of 11 September, instead of minimising the potential risks and taking the necessary measures to secure this dangerous plant, the UK Government has decided to expand the activities at Sellafield by approving the new MOX plant.</P>
    <P>This decision by the UK Government is a measure of the extent to which it now takes our Government for granted over Sellafield. It is a far cry from the days of the rainbow Government when co-ordinated activity at all levels of Government and direct intervention by the then Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, caused the then UK Government to drop plans for the Nirex dump. It is not surprising that the UK Government should have concluded that the Administration of the Taoiseach is no longer serious about Sellafield. The Government effectively stood down the ministerial committee on Sellafield. It eased off on the diplomatic pressure being put on the UK Government and put the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, in solitary charge. The British Government drew its own conclusions.</P>
    <P>This Labour Party motion should be passed by the Dáil tomorrow evening. I appeal to the Government not to divide the House on it but to accept it. It will show the UK Government that it should not mistake the Taoiseach's empty rhetoric for the real determination of the Irish people and this House to close the Sellafield plant. As a first step, the UK Government must reverse its decision on the MOX plant, and if it does not do so, it must be taken before the courts in the United Kingdom and Europe.</P>
    <P>At the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis the Taoiseach called for the closure of Sellafield. In the absence of effective action by his Government this is no more than party conference rhetoric. After all, a Government which failed to stop the expansion <Col N="1204" /> of Sellafield can hardly be expected to get it closed altogether.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to stop being rhetorical about the closure of Sellafield and get real about it. The UK Government needs to do so also. It needs to face the fact that Sellafield will inevitably close. The production of plutonium by reprocessing spent nuclear fuels is not economical, nor has it been for a long time. It never will be in a world gradually turning away from nuclear weapons and unsustainable forms of energy production.</P>
    <P>Whatever international tolerance there may have been for nuclear reprocessing in the past is changing gradually. The OSPAR decision, for example, which requires zero discharges of nuclear waste into the marine environment by 2020 means that reprocessing at Sellafield will have to be ended by then.</P>
    <P>The population of Great Britain will become increasingly concerned about the environmental, health and security risks posed by Sellafield. The European Parliament report to which I referred draws attention to what it calls the excess incidence of childhood leukaemia around Sellafield. As people in the United Kingdom become more concerned, it is inevitable that the political position there will shift from one of tolerance to a demand for closure.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, therefore, should try to convince the UK Government that it is inevitable that Sellafield will have to be closed eventually. It should also indicate to the UK Government that if it accepts the inevitability of the closure of the plant and that if it were to close it immediately, we might be willing to engage, on a joint basis, in measures for the future decommissioning of the site, its subsequent management and winding down and, if necessary, the redevelopment of an alternative economy in the Cumbria area.</P>
    <P>The closure of Sellafield will result in a requirement to make safe and manage, possibly for centuries to come, the nuclear materials and wastes now stockpiled on the site. This process will be complex and pose a continuing risk in terms of security, health and environment to this island and its people. It makes sense, therefore, that the Government and our State agencies should be involved.</P>
    <P>The closure of Sellafield will have enormous economic consequences for Cumbria. We should not take these lightly. The closure, with the loss of perhaps 15,000 jobs, would be a bigger economic blow to Cumbria than the closure of Aer Lingus would be to north Dublin. We should recognise the economic implications and be prepared to consider how we might assist in developing alternative economic opportunities for Cumbria in circumstances where the UK Government would be prepared to close Sellafield on a timetable to be agreed with us. Perhaps we could put in place together, under the east-west dimension of the Good Friday Agreement, some joint economic programmes which would address job and income losses arising from the closure. Perhaps our industrial development <Col N="1205" /> agencies could assist in giving favoured status for Cumbria for a specified period.</P>
    <P>Getting real about the closure of Sellafield means the UK Government coming to terms with the inevitability of closure. It means that, on this side of the Irish Sea, we should be prepared to consider assisting the economy of Cumbria if the UK authorities are willing to close it sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>We need to go beyond the kind of rhetoric we heard from the Taoiseach at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis and need action on several fronts, as indicated in the Labour Party motion. The kind of co-ordinated and concerted approach recommended to the House in the motion is the kind that has to be taken by the Government if it is to get serious about the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister of State not to amend the Labour Party motion tomorrow night, but to agree to it in the House. It is not an issue on which the House should divide. The Government should be big enough, albeit with the applied criticisms contained in part of the motion, to accept it and demonstrate a united position in the House on this important national issue.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuilim fíor-bhuíoch do phairtí an Lucht Oibre as a cuid ama a roinnt liom agus is maith an rún atá os ár gcomhair anseo. The past six weeks have been an incredible period for all of us. We seem to be inhabiting a topsy turvy world, with each new day bringing even more new and bizarre horrors and events to our television screens and news headlines that sometimes appear to be in the outer realms of science fiction. Since the World Trade Centre and Washington attacks of 11 September, everything has changed.</P>
      <P>Following British Prime Minister Tony Blair's expressing, at his party conference, a vision to build a new world and his statement that terrorist attempts to obtain nuclear or biological weapons must be &ldquo;exposed, disrupted and stamped out,&rdquo; an announcement was slipped out that the British Government had sanctioned the development of the MOX plant at Sellafield. The British Government decided to sanction a nuclear fuel plant that provides the vital ingredients for making nuclear bombs. The decision and its timing were outrageous. What is also outrageous is the foot-dragging engaged in by our own Government on the issue. Where is the legal challenge about which we have been hearing for years? Why is the issue only now being &ldquo;looked into&rdquo; by the Government? Why was Sellafield not in the dock years ago?</P>
      <P>The main terrorist threat facing the people of Ireland today is from the activities at Sellafield and the calamity that could befall this country as a result of those activities. This has been an ongoing terrorist threat. The events of 11 September, however, brought it to a critical level. Something must now be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> The German Government has done research and concluded that a nuclear power plant could not withstand a crash from a targeted passenger jet plane. The report conducted by the EU shows that Chernobyl would be very small compared to an explosion Sellafield. If a plane hit Sellafield, more than 44 times the radioactivity released at Chernobyl would be generated. It is estimated this would cause more than two million cancers. Incidentally, Sellafield does not have any anti-aircraft defences. The report also shows that emissions from Sellafield contained radiation in excess of levels recommended both by the EU and the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment in the North-East Atlantic.</P>
    <P>The British Government apparently sought advice after 11 September on the safety of the new mixed oxide, MOX, plant, but it merely sought and relied on informal advice from civil servants from the branch of Government which owns BNFL. The Office of Civilian Nuclear Security is financed and staffed by the British Department of Trade and Industry, the sole shareholder in BNFL. This so-called independent body said the risk of the MOX nuclear fuel, which will be shipped around the globe, falling into terrorists' hands or being used to produce a nuclear bomb was negligible.</P>
    <P>This is clearly not the case. The Royal Society, Britain's premier scientific body, reported three years ago that plutonium could be extracted relatively easily from the material in MOX shipments. A report from the US Government's Office of Arms Control and Non-Proliferation used similar words. Dr. Frank Barnaby, a nuclear weapons specialist and member of the Oxford Research Group, has said that starting up the MOX plant will &ldquo;make it virtually inevitable that terrorists will acquire the plutonium they want from the fuel, and make nuclear weapons with it&rdquo;. He said this was not technically demanding and that a second year undergraduate would be able to master the concepts involved. Last month a conference in Vienna of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the international watchdog on atomic energy, specifically raised the alarm of terrorist attack and/or the stealing of nuclear weapons materials from either Sellafield or Cap de la Hague in France.</P>
    <P>Despite these warnings, the British Government is proceeding with MOX, citing economic arguments. After all the scandals, the falsified safety data, loss of customer confidence, dangerous radioactive emissions and a litany of accidents, the British Government is proceeding with the MOX nuclear fuel extension to Sellafield. This is apparently for earnings of up to £150 million over the lifetime of the MOX plant. For this we are to endure a major terrorist headache and threat. These are false economics when one considers that the cost of £473 million for building the plant is not included. The enormous costs of decommissioning the plant have also been ignored. The court case being taken by Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace against the MOX <Col N="1207" /> facility argues that the decision on MOX is unlawful because the economic benefits of the scheme have been distorted and there is insufficient evidence that the plant will attract customers. As Greenpeace has said, the British Government &ldquo;seems as ever hell-bent on supporting BNFL at any cost, even if that means plutonium shipments bobbing about like sitting ducks on the high sea&rdquo;. Ireland is now a sitting duck.</P>
    <P>What is the Irish Government going to do about this intolerable and perverse situation? It is a matter of urgency that we have an answer to this and that we have clear, concrete action. OSPAR can only go so far on this issue. We now hear mention from the Government of going to the European Court or even the United Nations. Surely the Government in its years in office would have figured out by now with the assistance of the Attorney General how such a case could be pursued. Why are we constantly told that the Government and the Attorney General are looking into a court case against Sellafield as if each time Sellafield hits the headlines it is a new problem? The facts are clear. Sellafield and MOX are dangers to us, to the British people and to the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>The Government's record on this issue has been a litany of inaction and broken promises. When it has failed to act, the people have tried. Stop Thorp Alliance Dundalk, STAD, was promised financial assistance in a Fianna Fáil manifesto for legal and technical research. In four years STAD has only managed to squeeze a minuscule amount for technical research. The legal case is still not being financed.</P>
    <P>The EURATOM Treaty, EU law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea are all legal avenues the Green Party in Government would seriously and vigorously pursue. The Government should push both at the UN Security Council and within the EU for the immediate implementation of Dr. Gordon Thompson's plans to end reprocessing, which would provide replacement employment for BNFL workers. It should also call for no-fly and offshore exclusion zones around nuclear power stations and reprocessing facilities. Taking a case against Sellafield now is probably the most concrete and farreaching step the Government could ever take if it is serious about a war against terrorism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for sharing time. I support the motion and the programme of action laid out in it. Like other speakers, I appeal to the Minister and the Government not to divide the House on this issue, to adopt the Labour Party motion, support it and take immediate legal action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the outrageous safety record at Sellafield. BNFL over the years has been guilty of cover-ups, alteration of records and downright lies. We have been told on numerous occasions that the plant is safe and, unfortunately, we have <Col N="1208" /> been told by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that the level of emissions from it is safe. However, those of us who have always suspected the plant was anything but safe and that the level of emissions was above accepted levels and was dangerous have been supported by a high level report from the European Union.</P>
    <P>This report is dynamite. It states that an accident at Sellafield could result in the deaths of 1 million people from cancer. It also claims the operation at Sellafield has breached European and international agreements and poses a serious health and safety risk. Accidents such as an aircraft crashing into the facility or the waste tanks at the site could cause an accident much greater than Chernobyl, releasing almost 40 times the amount of radioactive material and leading to the death of 1 million people globally from cancer over a prolonged period.</P>
    <P>Of more immediate interest and importance to us regarding the proposed mixed oxide plant at Sellafield is the assertion in the report that current and proposed operations at the plant breach international treaties and EU law. The report also claims the United Kingdom authorities have not complied with part of the EURATOM Treaty because they have never sought the opinion of the European Commission on any activity at Sellafield. It also claims the European Commission has never effectively used its inspection rights at the plant.</P>
    <P>The OSPAR agreement to reduce radioactive waste to close to zero by 2020, to which the UK and Ireland are signatories, has also been breached in both letter and spirit according to the report. It also contends that the current method of assessing radiation doses is too narrow and does not reflect the precautionary approach.</P>
    <P>This report highlights something we have all understood for some time and which has now come into the public domain &ndash; the operation at Sellafield is dangerous. The first steps must taken to put a stop to the mixed oxide plant and to close Sellafield. I appeal to the Government to adopt the Labour Party motion, especially the programme of action listed in it, and not to divide the House on the issue tomorrow night.</P>

      <P>I move amendment</P>
      <P>No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;concerned at the continuing and increased threat to the health and safety of Irish citizens posed by the Sellafield nuclear plant in Britain and conscious, in particular of the increased danger of a terrorist attack on the plant or on shipments of nuclear materials passing through the Irish Sea:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;notes the long and unsatisfactory history <Col N="1209" /> of accidents and incidents at the Sellafield plant;</P>
    <P>&ndash;endorses the Government's condemnation of the recent decision to sanction the commissioning of the Sellafield mixed oxide fuel fabrication plant;</P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the action being taken by the Government, including legal action initiated by the Government against the UK Government under the OSPAR Convention to prevent the commissioning of the MOX plant;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the Government is finalising consideration of further legal action against the UK Government in regard to the MOX plant under the EU and EURATOM Treaties and under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the strong representations made by the Government to the UK Government and at the OSPAR Commission against the proposed commissioning of the MOX plant;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that radioactive waste from Sellafield is one of the areas identified for consideration in the work of the British-Irish Council Environment Sectoral Group;</P>
    <P>&ndash;endorses the work being carried out by the Ministerial Committee on Nuclear Safety which comprises ministerial representation from the key Government Departments, the Attorney General's office and representation from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) and which gives added impetus to the Government campaign against Sellafield;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the RPII continues to maintain contact with the UK nuclear installations inspectorate with regard to safety standards at the Sellafield plant;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the effective role being carried out the RPII in monitoring radioactivity contamination of the marine, air and terrestrial environment;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the potential consequences for Ireland of a terrorist attack on the Sellafield plant would be of the same nature as that of a major accident at the plant and that the Irish Government has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents to ensure a rapid, co-ordinated and effective response to such an accident or disaster at Sellafield or elsewhere; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the Government will shortly be publishing an updated version of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, reflecting improvements made to the plan in recent years, and that a sum<Col N="1210" /> mary of the plan will be circulated also to every household.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government submits its own counter motion because the Labour motion fails to recognise the vigorous campaign which the Government has pursued against the Sellafield operations, including the Sellafield mixed oxide, MOX, fuel fabrication plant.</P>
    <P>For years, the Sellafield facility has been a source of grave concern to successive Irish Governments and the Irish public. This facility, with its multiplicity of operations, represents a potentially serious threat to Ireland's public health and environment as well as to our vital commercial interests, such as fishing, agriculture and tourism. It is time this threat was removed once and for all. The Government remains firmly committed to its opposition to the continued operation and expansion of Sellafield &ndash; our priority is to bring about the cessation of all activities at the plant.</P>
    <P>The Government's concerns about Sellafield relate particularly to the safety standards and safety management at the site; the storage on site in liquid form of high level radioactive waste; the continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the site; the transportation of nuclear fuels to and from the plant; the continued operation of the old Magnox reactors; the discharge of radioactive materials into the Irish Sea and, most importantly, the risk of a catastrophic accident.</P>
    <P>The Government, since taking office, has spared no effort in making known to the UK authorities its concerns about and objection to the Sellafield operations. Since assuming the Government's portfolio for nuclear safety and radiological protection, I have had numerous meetings with UK Ministers and have repeatedly called for the cessation of operations at Sellafield. The Government's concerns have also been highlighted at every available opportunity in the international arena, such as at EU level, at the International Atomic Energy Agency, the OECD and meetings held under the umbrella of the OSPAR convention relating to marine pollution.</P>
    <P>All these concerns are also conveyed directly to the UK authorities at meetings of the UK-Ireland contact group on radioactivity. This group comprises officials from my Department, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and officials from the relevant UK Government Departments and agencies. The group meets twice a year and provides the opportunity to pursue Ireland's concerns about Sellafield and other related matters. It is reasonable to say that the UK Government is under no illusion whatsoever as to the depth of opposition in Ireland to the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>A dominant theme of the Government's campaign against Sellafield has been the genuine fear of the consequences of a major accident at the site. The Sellafield plant is no stranger to accidents. An investigation in 1999 by the UK's nuclear installations inspectorate into safety procedures and standards at the plant was prompted by a series of incidents that year. The subsequent <Col N="1211" /> report published by the UK inspectorate in February 2000, one of three reports published at the time by the inspectorate, was severely critical of safety management and safety culture at the plant and made no less than 28 recommendations for improving safety. Today, 18 months later, few of these 28 recommendations have been implemented by BNFL and this must raise serious question marks about current safety standards at the plant.</P>
    <P>At a time of heightened international tension arising from the terrible events of 11 September and the increased threat of terrorist attacks, the vulnerability of nuclear installations is a matter of real concern. The events of 11 September have highlighted new security risks which were previously unimagined. These events show that there is a huge onus on those countries with nuclear installations to protect their installations from such attacks. These countries have an absolute duty to do everything possible to protect their dangerous installations from attack, irrespective of the cost.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House of the Government's dismay and anger at the announcement by the UK Government that it has given the go-ahead to the Sellafield MOX plant. At a time when one would have expected countries with nuclear installations to consider the very real threat to safety and security and to consolidate safety and security standards, the UK Government's decision to effectively expand operations at Sellafield defies belief.</P>
    <P>The proposals by British Nuclear Fuels Limited to establish the MOX fuel production plant at Sellafield date back to the early 1990s when it first applied for planning permission to construct the facility. Ireland objected strongly to the project at that time but planning permission for the plant was granted in 1994. Construction of the MOX plant was actually completed in 1998 at a cost of over £300 million and I understand that capital expenditure of £450 million has been injected into the project.</P>
    <P>In 1996, BNFL applied to the UK environment agency for approval to operate the plant. It is amazing that this approval was sought so late in the life of the project. Since then, the BNFL application has been the subject of no less than five public consultations held by the UK authorities and UK Ministers, the most recent of which was completed in August 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government has strongly and consistently opposed the commissioning of the MOX plant and its concerns about this plant have been conveyed to the UK authorities in every possible manner and in our responses to each of the five separate rounds of public consultation over the period 1997 to 2001.</P>
    <P>The MOX fuel to be produced at Sellafield would be made from uranium and plutonium material separated from spent fuel which is reprocessed mainly in BNFL's thermal oxide reprocessing plant, or THORP, as it is better known. <Col N="1212" /> Therefore, the production of MOX fuel is effectively part of the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing industry at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Ireland is strongly opposed to nuclear reprocessing activities that generate gaseous and liquid radioactive discharges which contaminate the terrestrial and marine environment. Furthermore, the resulting production of plutonium creates an unnecessary risk that plutonium could be diverted for nuclear weapons production or terrorist activity.</P>
    <P>Even countries with nuclear programmes are questioning the merits of reprocessing on economic and safety grounds. The nuclear spent fuel reprocessing industry is now separating more plutonium than the nuclear industry is able to absorb. Sellafield now has a stockpile of plutonium which represents a potential risk to existing and future generations. The existence of such a large stockpile demonstrates how ill-advised it is to persist with reprocessing.</P>
    <P>The commissioning of the MOX plant will add even further to the multiplicity of operations already at Sellafield, thereby increasing the risk of an accident. It will increase the volume of worldwide transport of MOX fuel with obvious additional volume of traffic in the Irish Sea, thus posing an unacceptable safety and security risk as well as the potential for a major accident or terrorist attack. It will also perpetuate nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield and add to radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. While I am advised that the increase in discharges associated with the MOX plant is likely to be small, any contamination whatsoever of our marine environment is objectionable and unacceptable. The Government sees no justification whatsoever for the MOX plant and will do everything possible to bring about a reversal of the UK Government's decision.</P>
    <P>The Government has already initiated legal action against the UK under the OSPAR convention in regard to the MOX plant. The Government's legal action began in June this year and relates to the fact that the UK, on grounds of commercial confidentiality, withheld pertinent information essential to assessing the economic justification of the MOX plant. This action is proceeding on schedule and an arbitration tribunal is in the process of being established under the OSPAR convention to consider the case.</P>
    <P>I specifically requested the UK not to take any decision on the MOX plant while the OSPAR arbitration process was in train. However, the UK did not accede to my request and instead has taken the decision to give the go-ahead to the plant, a decision which is totally unacceptable to Ireland and difficult to fathom, particularly in the current climate of heightened terrorist threats.</P>
    <P>In my responses to the public consultations held by the UK, I had made it clear that the information being made available to the public in the consultation papers was inadequate and insufficient to assess or support the economic justification of the MOX plant. I had repeatedly <Col N="1213" /> demanded, without success, full release of the information withheld by the UK which purports to support the economic justification of the plant.</P>
    <P>The Government does not accept the UK Government's decision that the MOX plant is justified. Indeed, in announcing its decision to give the go-ahead to the plant, the UK Government said that 2,000 of the 9,000 respondents to the consultation process were against the proposed commissioning of the plant.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the depth of economic data and information deleted from the UK's public consultation documents relating to the plant, the Irish Government cannot accept an economic analysis which writes off capital costs of £450 million already injected into the project. Furthermore, there must be serious question marks about the projected markets for MOX fuel notably in respect of the Japanese and German markets which are identified by BNFL as the primary markets for MOX. Germany has already announced that it is phasing out nuclear power. Japan has its own plans to produce MOX fuel which would further reduce the demand for MOX fuel from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Immediately following the UK Government's MOX decision, the Taoiseach personally conveyed to Prime Minister Blair the Government's implacable opposition to the UK's decision. In addition, I wrote to both the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Health reiterating our opposition to the MOX plant and calling upon the UK Government to suspend with immediate effect the authorisation of the MOX plant and to take the necessary steps to halt, also with immediate effect, all transportation of radioactive materials in and around the Irish Sea to and from the plant. I also informed them that we will be deciding on future legal actions under EU and-or UN law in the near future. It is fair to say that, at this stage, the Government has exhausted all efforts at a bilateral level with the UK in trying to stop this plant being commissioned.</P>
    <P>The next step as far as the Government is concerned is to pursue further legal options. We have some time before the MOX plant is fully commissioned but not a lot. In tandem with the legal action already proceeding under OSPAR, final consideration of the EU and UN legal options is complete and a decision on the next action to be taken will be made by the Government in a matter of days. We will not be deterred from issuing proceedings on a number of fronts if necessary.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that Ireland highlighted its concerns about Sellafield on the international stage. Ireland has been particularly active in the OSPAR Commission against the Sellafield spent nuclear fuel reprocessing activities and associated discharges into the marine environment. In July 1998, at the meeting of the OSPAR Ministers from the contracting states to the OSPAR Convention, the Ministers adopted a strategy on radioactive substances. This strategy commits the contracting parties, which include the UK, to the <Col N="1214" /> virtual elimination of radioactive discharges into the marine environment by the year 2020 through progressive and substantial reductions of such discharges. Ireland was to the fore in the drafting of the OSPAR strategy. Its adoption was a vindication of Ireland's efforts throughout the process and an endorsement of the genuine concerns of a number of the contracting states about such discharges.</P>
    <P>Following this strategy's adoption, Ireland was active at the subsequent meetings of the OSPAR Commission in 1999, 2000 and this year giving added impetus to its implementation. For example, at the meeting of the OSPAR Commission in June 2000, we tabled a draft decision effectively calling for an end to nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield. In the run up to that meeting, I met with each of the environment Ministers of the Nordic countries. I travelled to Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland seeking their support for Ireland's draft decision while the Danish Minister of the Environment, Mr. Svend Auken, met me in Dublin. At the June 2000 meeting, the OSPAR Commission adopted, by majority vote, a decision whereby current authorisations for discharges of radioactive materials to the marine environment would be reviewed as a matter of priority by the respective national authorities in order to implement the non-reprocessing option. The UK and France, which are involved in reprocessing activities, did not support this decision but its adoption effectively sent a clear message to those countries about the concerns of the majority of contracting parties over continued reprocessing activities.</P>
    <P>At this year's meeting of the OSPAR Commission, in June 2001, Ireland tabled a draft decision calling for the completion, as a matter of urgency, of the current review of discharge authorisation limits by the contracting parties to the convention and that, in the meantime, there should be a moratorium on activities which promote the reprocessing of spent fuel. Arising from Ireland's proposal, the OSPAR commission, at that meeting, adopted by majority vote, a decision which called for the urgent completion of the current review of discharge authorisations from nuclear reprocessing facilities. The commission also agreed at that meeting that the deadline be brought forward for submission by contracting parties of details of their national plans for the implementation of the OSPAR strategy.</P>
    <P>In the run up to the June 2001 OSPAR Commission meeting, I personally wrote to the relevant Government Minister in each of the OSPAR contracting states and the EU Commissioner for the Environment informing them that Ireland would be tabling the draft decision. In my letter, I also expressed the concerns of the Government over the resumption of shipments of spent nuclear fuel from Germany and the Netherlands to the Sellafield reprocessing plant. I pointed out that the resumption of such shipments is not in keeping with the spirit of the OSPAR decision, adopted at the previous year's <Col N="1215" /> commission meeting, on the reduction of discharges of radioactive substances arising from nuclear reprocessing activities.</P>
    <P>The UK Government's decision to give the go-ahead to the MOX plant raises serious questions about its commitment to the OSPAR strategy. The UK Government is currently undertaking a full scale review of radioactive discharge authorisation limits in respect of the Sellafield plant as part of its plan to address the strategy. This review is being conducted with full public consultation. Already the UK has conducted three public consultations and a fourth is currently under way. The Irish Government is participating fully in this consultation process and is determined that the UK will not shirk from addressing its commitments under the OSPAR strategy. The Irish Government is determined to bring about an end to reprocessing activities at Sellafield and radioactive discharges and will continue to work closely with its like minded partners within OSPAR, particularly the Nordic countries, in achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland plays an important role in the Government's campaign against Sellafield. The RPIl was particularly active within the OSPAR working groups in the drafting of the OSPAR strategy and continues to play an active role in these groups to ensure its effective implementation. The RPII is also in regular contact with the UK nuclear installations inspectorate in monitoring BNFL's implementation of the inspectorate's February 2000 safety improvement recommendations relating to Sellafield which I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>The Government has long been concerned about the risks associated with the storage of high level liquid waste in tanks in Sellafield. Despite assurances received from the UK authorities on the safety of the storage arrangements, the Government continues to press the UK to speed up the vitrification of this waste, whereby the liquid waste is solidified into what is deemed to be a much safer form of storage. In 1999, following sustained pressure from the Government, BNFL allowed the RPII to examine, on the BNFL site, the safety standards documentation relating to the storage arrangements of high level liquid waste. The allowed the RPII to come to its own conclusions as to the safety of the storage arrangements. The following year, the RPII published its report of its examination of the BNFL safety documentation which concluded that the risk of a severe accident associated with the storage arrangements was low. However, it made a number of recommendations for reducing the risk and has been maintaining contact with the UK authorities over the implementation of these recommendations.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September raise concerns about the ability of the storage tanks at Sellafield to withstand the impact of an aircraft colliding with them. The BNFL safety documentation examined by the RPII stated that only a heavy <Col N="1216" /> commercial or military aircraft could inflict sufficient damage to result in a loss of coolant and aerial release of radioactivity. The events of last month, however, must call into question the capacity of the tanks to withstand a similar terrorist strike and it is imperative that the UK authorities have the necessary measures in place at Sellafield to withstand such an attack.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that our concerns about Sellafield are also conveyed to the UK authorities at meetings of the UK-Ireland Contact Group on Radioactivity. Sellafield is also included in the work of the British-Irish Council &ndash; BIC &ndash; environment sectoral group. The British-Irish Council, as the House knows, was established under the Good Friday Agreement to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands. The council comprises representatives of the British and Irish Governments, the devolved Administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and representatives of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The purpose of the BIC is to exchange information, discuss, consult and use best endeavours to reach agreement on co-operation on matters of mutual interest within the competence of the relevant Administrations. At the inaugural meeting in October 2000 of the BIC environment sectoral group, hosted by the British Government in London, it was agreed that a paper would be prepared by the Irish Government and the Isle of Man on radioactive waste from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, this Government established in 1998 a ministerial committee on nuclear safety which comprises ministerial representation from key Government Departments and representation from the RPII and the Attorney General's office. Its remit is wide ranging covering all matters relating to nuclear safety and radiological protection. The Sellafield operations constitute a major part of its work. The committee was established primarily to give added focus and impetus to the Government's campaign against Sellafield. Since its establishment it has met on 12 occasions. The MOX plant is among a number of Sellafield related issues which have been on the committee's programme for some time. The MOX plant and the Government's campaign against it are key items on the committee's agenda. The Government's approach and opposition to the plant have been discussed and supported at numerous meetings of the committee since its establishment in 1998. The committee plays a very important role in informing Government policy in regard to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I referred to the increased threat of a terrorist attack on nuclear installations. Concern about terrorist attacks on Sellafield or other nuclear plants has raised public concerns about our preparedness to deal with the consequences of a nuclear incident. The public is right to be concerned, but wrong to be unduly alarmed.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the RPII, <Col N="1217" /> has primary responsibility for emergency planning for nuclear accidents. A national emergency plan for nuclear accidents is in place to ensure a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release or potential release of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure of the public.</P>
    <P>The potential consequences for Ireland of an attack on the Sellafield plant, similar to the attack on the World Trade Centre, would essentially be of the same nature as those of a major accident at the plant. The actual consequences of a particular accident would depend primarily on the quantity of radioactivity released and prevailing weather conditions, especially wind direction. Under the nuclear emergency plan, an assessment team, comprising scientists from the RPII, assisted by Met Éireann personnel, would assemble promptly and, on the basis of available information, provide advice as to the likely extent of effects on Ireland, how soon those effects might be experienced, and what areas of the country would be likely to be affected. This information would, in turn, provide a basis for advice as to the appropriate countermeasures to be put in place.</P>
    <P>The nuclear emergency plan is designed to cater for a major disaster at a nuclear installation in Britain or another country, which would result in radioactive contamination reaching Ireland. The plan is not designed to deal with a direct nuclear attack on Ireland, but obviously a number of the arrangements and measures contained in the plan would be relevant in such a scenario.</P>
    <P>The plan provides a structure for the management of the effects of such a disaster or accident under the overall direction of a committee of Ministers. It outlines the measures in place to assess and mitigate the effects of nuclear accidents which might pose a radiological hazard in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The plan describes the early warning systems operated by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Union for alerting states of any radiological accident; shows how accidents management will operate; how technical information and radioactivity monitoring data will be collected; how public information will be provided and what measures may be taken for the protection of the public in the short and long-term.</P>
    <P>Once the plan is triggered the emergency response co-ordination committee goes into immediate session in a central control room. This committee comprises representation from all key Departments and agencies. Armed with information from the RPII and other agencies, notably Met Éireann because prevailing weather conditions will play a vital role, this committee will decide on and co-ordinate the implementation of countermeasures and public safety advice.</P>
    <P>Providing accurate information and advice for the public is of major importance. Information will be released throughout the course of the <Col N="1218" /> emergency by the RPII using national radio and television and the Internet.</P>

      <P>I sat here and did not interrupt anybody. I would like to continue my contribution without interruption because it is a very important subject. The public should stay tuned to bulletins which will provide information and best advice on a frequent basis. My Department has overall responsibility for the nuclear emergency plan and ensuring the co-ordination of the responsibilities and functions of the relevant Departments and statutory agencies. The relevant Departments and agencies have responsibilities under the plan to establish procedures to implement measures within their particular fields of competence, including integration, where appropriate, with emergency services already provided for other civil emergencies.</P>
      <P>The national emergency plan currently in the public domain dates back to 1992. Since then it has been reviewed and a number of refinements and improvements have been introduced. The updating of the plan has nothing to do with the appalling events in the United States. Emergency plans, by their nature, are subject to continuous review and updating, as appropriate. Our nuclear emergency plan is the product of years of learning and review. It is not the plan of any particular Minister and not my plan as such. It represents the accumulated input of Energy Ministers during the years. For example, it was improved dramatically after the lessons from the Chernobyl accident. In particular, the monitoring stations around the coast are a direct legacy from that time. The current plan, published in 1992, has been undergoing review and an up-dated plan will be ready for publication towards the end of the year. It is also my intention to distribute a summary of the plan to every household in the country. In addition, recognising that there is a public need for immediate information on countermeasures in the event of a nuclear accident, an advertisement will be placed in national-provincial newspapers giving essential advice on these countermeasures which is simple, practical and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes to the plan are largely institutional in nature and designed to streamline administrative arrangements and reflect advances in science, technology, meteorology and administrative arrangements. The changes are designed to ensure prompt and effective analysis of any emergency and prompt communications to the public and key players, particularly concerning risk analysis and recommended countermeasures. The plan has been the subject of independent eval<Col N="1219" /> uation and a full scale exercise will take place early next month.</P>
    <P>I fully understand that concerns about a terrorist strike on Sellafield or other nuclear installation have raised public questions about our preparedness to deal with the consequences of a nuclear accident. However, our national emergency plan is designed to ensure a rapid, co-ordinated and effective response to any such accident or disaster.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of the Government's strong resolve to remove the threat to Ireland posed by the Sellafield plant. The cessation of all activities at Sellafield remains a priority for the Government and we will pursue every possible means, diplomatic and legal, to achieve this objective. More immediately, our action to prevent the MOX plant operating is proceeding and a further decision on further legal action will be taken later this week.</P>

      <P>The contempt shown by the British Government for the concerns of its Irish counterpart in deciding to commission the MOX nuclear fuel production plant is bewildering on the one hand and quite understandable on the other. Britain sees Ireland as nothing other than &ldquo;a soft touch&rdquo;, as a hapless, helpless bystander who will make lots of ritual threats of legal action &ndash; we have had them again tonight &ndash; but who is totally ineffective when it comes to stopping the British in their tracks. The reality is that for the past four years the Irish Government has tiptoed and has pussyfooted around the Sellafield issue. The Government has spent four and a half years, as Deputy Stagg said, huffing and puffing and calling for the closure of Sellafield. Tonight we have had exactly the same rhetoric, language, threats and attempts to talk tough. The Minister of State said that we will not be deterred. However, Britain is saying in reply, &ldquo;We will not be moved&rdquo;. That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net result is that not alone has Sellafield, with all its attendant dangers, not been closed down but also that the MOX plant will be allowed to proceed into operation. The so-called excellent working relationship between the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, counts for nothing. Threats of legal action, promises about invoking the powers of the OSPAR convention and fight<Col N="1220" /> ing Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis rhetoric have come to nothing. We are talking tough but once again &ldquo;Britain Rules OK&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The contempt on the part of Tony Blair and BNFL is all the more blatant and glaring when one considers that the issue of Sellafield is currently the subject of arbitration proceedings between Ireland and the UK under the OSPAR convention for the protection of the marine environment. The Minister of State referred to his pleas to Britain not to proceed. His contribution was littered with phrases such as &ldquo;we have done so without success&rdquo; and &ldquo;unavailing efforts&rdquo;. He stated that we are &ldquo;again calling on Britain&rdquo; to do this, that and the other, and that we are &ldquo;going to pursue further legal action&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The campaign to have Sellafield closed down has repeatedly fallen on deaf ears and has been constantly and contemptuously rebuffed. To Britain this is a simple economic issue. The BNFL operation is one of the biggest in the world, with an annual turnover of £2.25 billion and an annual profit of £250 million. It has contracts worth £13.5 billion and a potential US contract worth £55 billion. It employs a workforce of 16,000 in Britain and 20,000 worldwide. All the environmental and health considerations have been relegated to secondary importance by the fact that this is a huge commercial operation which produces large quantities of electricity cheaply to keep the British economy in operation.</P>
    <P>The other problem is that Sellafield produces large quantities of radioactive spent fuel containing plutonium 239, a massively toxic substance with a life of approximately 25,000 years and with deadly cancer-causing capacity. The danger of an accident at Sellafield has always been a nightmare for this country. The torrent of lies and misinformation from Britain in relation to leaks from Windscale and Sellafield has completely shattered people's confidence in the bland assurances coming from that country. The falsification of MOX data in relation to trade with Japan has rightly led to the Japanese Government breaking its contract with Sellafield. As we speak, the plutonium-laden ship bound for Japan has been turned back by the Japanese authorities and is en route back to the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to accidents. It does not matter whether an accident or an attack occurs because an explosion at Sellafield would lead to massive fallout in terms of immediate and long-term loss of life. Sellafield has always been a much larger Chernobyl waiting to happen. However, the 11 September atrocities have focused the eyes of the world on the new frightening reality, namely, that what happened to the twin towers and to the so-called impregnable Pentagon could well happen to Sellafield. Gordon Thompson, to whom reference has been made, executive director of the Institute of Resource and Security Studies, has calculated that if a Boeing 747 ploughed into Sellafield the impact would break open several of its 21 concrete and steel tanks. These contain more than 5,300 cubic feet <Col N="1221" /> of high level radioactive liquid waste. The consequences would be horrendous.</P>
    <P>MOX has been lying idle and mothballed for four years. The decision two weeks ago by the British Government to open the £473 million nuclear plant adds considerably to its attractiveness for a strike by international terrorists. Despite all the assurances about security at Sellafield, recent history shows that this is far from the case. In 1995, more than 200 Greenpeace activists invaded Sellafield through the front gate and climbed to the top of the MOX plant beside the store for plutonium, the raw material for nuclear bombs. In 1998, the pipeline from Sellafield which pumps radioactive waste into the Irish Sea was blocked by protesters. In 1998, Greenpeace went underground at the Sellafield pipeline to pick up samples on the sea bed and survey the damage being done to marine life. Looking from outside the perimeter fence, one can see most of the pipeline exposed because there is no secondary security. The pipes are so exposed that one would be forgiven for believing that they could be punctured by a .22 rifle. A direct hit by a jet would contaminate Britain and Ireland with nearly three times more radioactivity than escaped during the Chernobyl disaster. Up to 2,646 pounds of the deadly isotope, caesium 137, would escape into the atmosphere and devastate Ireland, Britain and western Europe.</P>
    <P>The fears of the anti-Sellafield lobby have been well and truly vindicated by the recent EU report Possible Toxic Effects from Nuclear Reprocessing Plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague. It is extraordinary that this report, which was commissioned by the European Parliament and debated in Europe, was not mentioned once by the Minister of State. There is something unreal about the manner in which the Irish Government is dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>There have been attempts by the EU Commission and the French and British Governments to bury the report and the Irish Government is prepared to conspire with them by totally ignoring its contents. However, the report is now very much in the public domain and its findings are startling. It states that &ldquo;The reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at Sellafield and la Hague leads to the largest man-made releases of radioactivity into the environment worldwide&rdquo;, and also that &ldquo;The releases correspond to a large scale nuclear accident every year. Some of the radionuclides released have half lives of millions of years&rdquo;. This report, which was commissioned by the Scientific and Technological Option Assessment Committee of the European Parliament and written by a combination of nine of the top nuclear and environmental safety experts from Europe and the US, hands down the most damning denunciation of both Sellafield and the French plant.</P>
    <P>What these experts are, in essence, saying is that the two plants should be closed down. The plant on mainland Europe and that literally across the water from us pose a major threat to the lives of millions in western Europe. The <Col N="1222" /> report goes on to confirm that radioactive discharges from Sellafield have led to individual radiation doses exceeding &ldquo;ten times current UK and three times EU limits&rdquo;. What more damning evidence is required? Nine of the top experts in the world independently assessed the situation as they found it after detailed and laborious hands-on inspections and found the entire system to be wanting.</P>
    <P>The situation is extremely serious. It is time that, instead of issuing utterances and threats, we got to grips with the situation. Unless we pressurise the British and European authorities and demand and insist on the closure of Sellafield, the mothballing of the MOX plant once again and the closure of Cap de la Hague, we will live to rue our ineptitude.</P>
    <P>The report from the EU must be the last word on the subject. However, the Irish Government does not even appear to have read this report. The EU Commission, the French Government, the Irish Government, BNFL and the RPII stand indicted. We want no more anodyne assurances about radioactivity levels from the RPII. The people are not going to be fooled or conned anymore. They are demanding action and they deserve no less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak in favour of the motion tabled by Deputy Stagg and the Labour Party. Strong and affirmative action must be taken by us if we are to instil confidence among our citizens in the capability of this State to protect itself from the dangers presented by Sellafield. There is the danger not just of terrorist attack but a danger to our environment from emissions from Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The announcement on 4 October that the British Government had given the go-ahead for the operation of the MOX plant at Sellafield was met with outrage on both sides of the Irish Sea that the British Government would even consider such a move in light of the 11 September attacks. It obviously felt it was a good idea to slip in bad news that might otherwise not have received the same kind of coverage during a quiet news period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was outrage that the Government was perceived to have its eye off the ball and that the attempt at a cursory 'phone call had not even been made to inform the Government of the decision to go ahead with the MOX plant. Why was this? Was it because the UK Government did not get the message? Was it because the real fears and concerns of the Irish people were not expressed in strong enough terms? Was it because, as Deputy Stagg's motion outlines, the Government disbanded the team of scientific and legal experts established by the previous Govern<Col N="1223" /> ment and downgraded the ministerial working party on Sellafield? Newspaper reports stated that the Government specifically asked the UK Administration not to sanction the move pending the outcome of a legal challenge to the MOX reprocessing plant. Obviously that plea fell on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>There are two fears involved here &ndash; environmental fears and the threat of a terrorist attack on Sellafield. Discharges from the plant will be of concern to us and we must depend on our membership of the EU to ensure policing and enforcement of safety measures as the plant continues to operate. There has to be some criticism here of the Commission and the adequacy of its nuclear inspection systems. It is evident that the same safety levels do not obtain in plants across member states; this was borne out in debates in the European Parliament last night and we should also note that fact. The threat of a terrorist attack is real and must not be ignored. It existed before 11 September and that was why the report to which Deputy Higgins referred was commissioned; it was commissioned by the STOA Committee of the European Parliament before 11 September with a view to establishing the consequences of a terrorist attack.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister of State referred to a plan in the event of an emergency. I understood there was a differentiation between an accident and an attack but in either event an emergency arises. In the event of an accident, advertisements in newspapers would probably be placed after the event and given present anxiety, people would prefer information before an attack rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be before an attack. The advertisements will be out shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that as placing advertisements after the event is too late. We need to be equipped with the information now. I understood from the Minister of State's speech that this would be done after the attack but now we will have advertisements in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>The French Government has armed forces, aeroplanes, ground-to-air missiles and a no-fly zone around its nuclear plant at Cap la Hague. Why are there no such security measures around Sellafield? What is the Government doing to ensure such measures are put in place? That is the minimum that should be done at this stage prior to an eventual decision by the British Government to close the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State enumerated the Government's concerns about Sellafield: the safety standards and safety management at the site, the storage on site in liquid form of high level radioactive waste, the continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the site, the transportation of nuclear fuels to and from the site, the con<Col N="1224" /> tinued operation of the old Magnox reactors, the discharge of radioactive materials into the Irish Sea and the risk of a catastrophic accident.</P>
      <P>These were all valid complaints the Irish Government and people have had since before 11 September. The Minister of State went on to say the Government, since taking office, has spared no effort in making known to the UK authorities its concerns about and objections to the Sellafield operation. If this is true and the Government has campaigned as hard as it would like us to believe, then the action of the British Government is not only insensitive to our demands, it is provocative. That is the way to describe it.</P>
      <P>We have a right to be angry with the British Government and to be particularly angry given that it is a Labour Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>We also have a right to be angry with the Irish Government because this campaign is much ado about nothing and a great deal of bluster. As spokesman on energy I know what the Minister of State had to say on this two or three years ago. He is an honourable man and I believe him but as I listened to him I thought of another honourable man, Brutus, who, on this very day in 42 BC threw himself on his sword because of his failure of policy as an honourable man. Maybe the Minister of State should commit the political equivalent when thinking of the failure of his policy, as it has been a dismal failure of policy. It has been more bluster than anything else but I do not just blame the Minister of State &ndash; I blame the Government he represents.</P>
      <P>We on this island have a common interest in terms of Sellafield. The threat it poses, particularly after 11 September, is equal North and South. People North and South are scared &ndash; that is not too strong a word &ndash; by the possibility that Sellafield may become an objective of terrorist activity. Today is a good day to make this point, when it looks as if the power-sharing and cross-Border institutions in the North will be restored. Surely there is no better way to emphasise our common interest than by uniting North and South to beat this common threat. All traditions, religions and political parties in the North and South are united in our fear and detestation of what could happen in Sellafield. We should have a uniting campaign that will put pressure on the British Government in Europe and anywhere we can to eliminate this threat to our existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eddie McGrady, the SDLP MP for North Down, has shown his concern about this for many years, often appearing as a man in the wilderness with his campaign. There are more people like Eddie McGrady in Northern Ireland and their support ought to be mobilised in a common campaign to make the British realise that we are no longer blustering but that we mean what we say. <Col N="1225" /> There should be a concerted campaign by both Governments, North and South, and there should be joint action to challenge the monster of Sellafield. It should not be confined solely to the two Governments: the committee system North and South should be utilised to mobilise public opinion and to put pressure on the British. Backbenchers should be utilised as well. There is no better way to emphasise our common interest and determination to do something about this than to employ the joint action I suggest. This is the time for the Government to initiate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise an important issue, not only in my constituency, but in the west region of Dublin, in respect of which I failed to find a solution by way of parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>Last May the new west Dublin education centre was completed on the grounds of the Tallaght Institute of Technology. Five months later it remains closed. Furniture and equipment are being stockpiled and teachers are unable to access the new facility.</P>
      <P>Education centres are regional facilities which are a resource for teachers at primary and post-primary level. Each has a catchment area. Teachers normally go to their local centre for in-career development work, for example, on revised curricula, the introduction of new subjects or emphases, for courses relevant to teaching or to access libraries of printed books or software. In Dublin education centres are located at Drumcondra, Blackrock and west Dublin.</P>
      <P>The existing west Dublin education centre has been located for some years in the VEC premises on Monastery Road, Clondalkin, where conditions are grossly inadequate. A new centre has been badly needed for years and its completion last May held out the prospect of teachers being able to avail of the new resource starting last September. However, in one way or another, the dispute about the terms of leasing has been ongoing for almost four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's reply to a parliamentary question of mine on 16 October is regarded as disingenuous. The only inference which can be taken from it is that the building is still under construction. This is not the case and the dispute is of long standing. The former director of the west Dublin education centre warned 12 months ago about the present mess. Meanwhile the centre is losing money and the professional development of teachers is being inhibited. The centre cannot <Col N="1226" /> generate income and revenue going to adjacent hotels ought to be going to the centre.</P>
    <P>There appears to be no urgency about resolving this waste of public money and little concern about a splendid new centre lying idle. It is necessary for the Department to take an active hands-on approach to resolve this matter and permit the centre at Tallaght to function as planned and as desired by its staff. It is difficult to understand the official lethargy on this issue and no purpose is being served by seeking to give the impression that construction work is ongoing. The building is lying idle, costing public money and unable to provide the service for which it was planned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline the Department's position regarding the new Dublin West Education Centre in the grounds of Tallaght Institute of Technology. The Department has provided, with the assistance of the European Regional Development Fund, funding for the establishing-upgrading of 22 education centres, each with its own catchment area. The new purpose built Dublin West Education Centre is located in the grounds of Tallaght IT. The new building comprises approximately 650 mf7&gt;2 of accommodation at a cost in excess of £1.2 million and is currently at practical completion stage. In order to facilitate the occupation of this centre by the Dublin West Education Centre committee members, the management authority of Tallaght IT requires that the lease agreement in respect of the lands of approximately 1.5 acres on which the new education centre stands be finalised prior to occupation. Unfortunately, to date this matter has proven to be more protracted than had been anticipated. While officials of the Department have been in continuous communication with the management authority of Tallaght IT in an effort to produce a lease agreement that will be acceptable to the management authority of Tallaght IT, to date a resolution has not been reached. However, the Minister has instructed his officials to continue to pursue vigorously this matter with the view to ensuring it is resolved at the earliest possible date and thus pave the way for the occupation of the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity the Ceann Comhairle has given me to raise this issue with the Minister. Again this year the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals outlines a series of inadequacies, inefficiencies and lack of progress with regard to the provision of proper men<Col N="1227" /> tal health services. It is intolerable that year after year each report speaks about &ldquo;serious equality failings&rdquo;, &ldquo;lack of multidisciplinary teams&rdquo;, and &ldquo;wasteful service provisions&rdquo;. It states: &ldquo;It should be noted that most Irish services did not meet the community residential and day hospital requirements in 2000&rdquo;. This is a sad and unacceptable comment by the inspector on the state of mental healthcare services which appears on page 2 of the report.</P>
      <P>In his overview of the psychiatric services the inspector yet again points out that there are very few multidisciplinary teams in the mental healthcare service. There is a distinct absence of psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists and those who are employed are often professionally isolated in small services. The inspector also identifies that the number of training places for such professionals is inadequate to supply the numbers required.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to emphasise how important the true multidisciplinary approach is to effecting an efficient delivery of psychiatric services. The absence of this cohesive ethos at the centre of the system results in often piecemeal and incomplete care planning and treatment. The inspector alludes to the lack of a &ldquo;disciplined&rdquo; care programme approach in many instances and states &ldquo;this is a serious quality failing&rdquo;. What this means in practice is that those who are assessing the psychiatric services may not have an identifiable care plan based on a multidisciplinary assessment of need. The notion of a carefully thought out care plan is now common currency in most healthcare services and a serious omission from the mental healthcare provision.</P>
      <P>The inspector comments on the &ldquo;predominance of drug treatment which is often the only treatment available. Many patients complain that they do not have the option of psychotherapy or psychological treatments which they feel would be of greater help to them.&rdquo; This is a contentious issue in Irish mental healthcare. In the majority of cases the only treatment option offered to people with a severe mental disorder is a prescription of drugs. Drugs are often necessary to the recovery process, but they are by no means the only tool. There is a multitude of research which shows that sustained recovery is based not only on effective drug treatment, but on the availability of a range of allied interventions, such as behavioural therapy, counselling, psychotherapy and other psychological treatments. In addition, services such as access to information and support groups are also an essential part of the recovery process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector commented on the lack of community based residential accommodation, particularly high support accommodation. This is totally and utterly unacceptable. The number of available places at the end of the year was 2,993. <Col N="1228" /> This compares with a figure of 2,382 in 1991. The rate of development is inadequate. Many who are well able and well placed to live in the community are languishing in institutional care because of the lack of places.</P>
    <P>Once again, the inspector expresses concern about the rate of involuntary admissions and detentions prevailing in Ireland. Approximately 10% of all admissions are involuntary. This is very high by European standards, where the average rate is 5%. The key contributory factor is the lack of appropriate community based services which can intervene at an early stage to support the person concerned. The inspector expresses considerable concern that in some instances the level of mental health service is wasteful. It is important in times of plenty as well as in more difficult times there is a commitment to effective and efficient service provision.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the many groups who are promoting better practice in the mental health services, including Schizophrenia Ireland, the Irish Association of Suicidology, the Mental Health Association and the many other services involved in promoting positive mental health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the Adjournment and to respond on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 2000 and acknowledge the important role the inspector plays in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister met with the inspector recently to discuss his report and to elicit his views about the areas of the mental health services which need improvement. The inspector informed the Minister that steady progress is being made across the country in the move towards an integrated, community based mental health service but that much remains to be done.</P>
      <P>In his report for 2000 the inspector notes the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric in-patient facilities, from 4,768 at the end of 1999 to 4,559 at the end of 2000. There were more than 24,000 admissions to these facilities in 2000 of which approximately 6,750 were first admissions. The proportion of patients being admitted to acute psychiatric units in general hospitals continued to increase and in 2000 accounted for 43% of admissions. A further 13% were admitted to private hospitals. The number of involuntary admissions at approximately 2,450 remained constant at 10%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of welcome developments were reported in many of the health board regions during 2000. One significant development during the year was the opening of the new acute psychiatric <Col N="1229" /> unit at the Mercy Hospital, Cork, in April 2000 which represented a major step forward for the north Lee service. Work had also commenced on the construction of the new acute units at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, and at the general hospitals at Portlaoise, Castlebar and Ennis. In the eastern regional area, the upgrading and improvement of conditions in the admission units in both St. Brendan's Hospital and St. Ita's Hospital were welcomed as was the appointment of a new consultant led liaison psychiatric service at St. James's Hospital. Considerable expenditure had also been provided on upgrading the admission facilities in St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar.</P>
    <P>The inspector paid particular attention in his report to the innovative service developments that have taken place in the Cavan/Monaghan mental health service. This service had embarked on an intensive approach to care delivery for both acute illness and for those with more enduring mental disorders. Specialist teams had been set up to deal with acute illness on a community and domiciliary basis in both counties. At the same time, a specialist rehabilitation team was put in place to deal with more resistant illness. The results of this initiative were already being clearly seen in the reduction in the numbers of patients in both acute units in Monaghan and Cavan. This innovative development was welcomed by the inspector who commented that the service providers in Cavan-Monaghan brought a level of enthusiasm to service delivery which was refreshing. He stated further that the new approaches being developed in Cavan-Monaghan might well be significant for the manner in which psychiatric services will be delivered in this country in the future.</P>
    <P>The inspector also reported that community services were enhanced in a number of areas. Developments included the opening of new day hospitals in Swords, Athy, Celbridge and Letterkenny, day centres in Balbriggan, Celbridge and Westport, extensive refurbishment and upgrading of community residences in the St. James's Hospital service and the opening of supported residential accommodation in Newbridge, Rathdowney, Carndonagh and Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by the inspector at the lack of multi-disciplinary teams in many mental health services, particularly in the area of psychology, occupational therapy and social work services. The Department has provided additional resources to health boards this year for improvements in these services. However, many boards are experiencing problems in recruiting such professionals to the mental health services. A number of initiatives have been taken to deal with this problem. Among them are the commissioning of a work force planning study by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, increasing the number of student places in the therapy schools and implementing the recommendations of the <Col N="1230" /> Expert Group Report on Various Health Professions.</P>
    <P>In his latest report, the inspector also mentions progress on the implementation of the Mental Health Bill. The new Mental Health Act, which was signed by the President on 8 July 2001, provides for the independent and automatic review of each decision to detain a patient for psychiatric care and treatment and puts in place mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment provided in psychiatric in-patient facilities can be supervised and regulated. A mental health commission is to be set up to act as an independent agency to raise standards and practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the rights of detained persons are protected. The Minister hopes to appoint the members of the mental health commission within the next few months.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention to facilitate health boards in bringing about the necessary improvements and developments identified by the inspector in his report. Capital funding of approximately £150 million has been provided for the development of mental health services over the lifetime of the national development plan. This funding will go towards the development of acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals and the enhancement of community based residences and facilities.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue funding of £18.64 million has been provided this year for improvements in mental health services. Priority is being given to the further development of community based mental health services, the further expansion of child and adolescent psychiatry and the psychiatry of old age and the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on suicide. Provision has also been made for additional funding to voluntary bodies representing the interests of the users of the mental health services and their families and carers, and I wish to join in commending them for their work.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that the inspector's report is not being ignored. Significant progress has been made in recent years in modernising the mental health services and the Minister is committed to ensuring that we continue that progress.</P>

      <P>This has become a saga. The first meeting on the transfer of lands to the Dublin Institute of Technology from the Eastern Health Board took place in October 1995, exactly six years ago. A further meeting of all the parties and all public representatives for the area, including the Taoiseach, took place in March 1996. At that meeting it was indicated that agreement in principle had been reached that 67 of the 77 acres were surplus to the requirement of the Eastern <Col N="1231" /> Health Board and would be transferred to the Dublin Institute of Technology. Every few months since then there have been promises that this would happen within months.</P>
      <P>I initiated this idea as it was clear the lands at Grangegorman were becoming surplus to requirements and were becoming very derelict, as were the buildings on the land. In addition, many local football and sports clubs which had used of the lands were being inched off them, prompting me to raise questions about the proposed future of the lands.</P>
      <P>Every residents' association was consulted not once but several times, and several public meetings were held which were attended by members of the Eastern Health Board, the corporation and the Dublin Institute of Technology. All meetings fully supported the idea of the EHB lands at Grangegorman being used as a third level campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology. Nobody resisted this idea &ndash; it was unanimously supported by people in their hundreds through attendance at meetings, letters and petitions. All the public representatives also supported the idea.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger has come and gone, and the lands, which are within a few hundred yards of Dominic Street, which leads to Henry Street in the city centre, are lying fallow. There is a housing crisis in the city, and if the Dublin Institute of Technology is not to get the land, then some of it could be used to address that crisis. However, there is still very strong local support for its use by the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>We have been pressing this issue since 1995. On 3 March 1998 the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology wrote to me saying &ldquo;I agree, this would be a very fine campus&rdquo;. A few months later he told me he expected this not to be settled within a few weeks, but &ldquo;within a couple of months . . . and not many months&rdquo;. Since then it has always been on the brink of being settled. Every few months I got letters saying it would be solved shortly. I do not have time to go through all the letters I have received over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and wrote to him, to outline the great opportunity of this huge area of land. I have no doubt he is as interested in it as I am. An interdepartmental group was set up at my suggestion, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. The reply to each inquiry since has been that it is being studied and it will be ready. I was told two months ago that the interdepartmental group report would be available within weeks, perhaps two weeks. It is now the end of October 2001, exactly six years after the original proposal appeared to be accepted, and there is the same promise that a report will be produced imminently. I want to know where is the interdepartmental group and who are the members? Will it <Col N="1232" /> report shortly and, if so, when will the report be published? To what extent will local public representatives and local residents be involved? I ask the Minister of State to realise that the longer the land lies there the more uncertainty and problems it will create for neighbouring areas such as Stoneybatter, Grangegorman, Rathdown Road, Aughrim Street and nearby Church Street and Broadstone.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to come clean and not fob us off any more by saying it will happen in another few weeks if that is not the case. I want to have a date and to hear what will happen to this land.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter.</P>
      <P>To answer specifically Deputy Mitchell's questions and outline the facts in regard to the interdepartmental <i>ad hoc</i> working group, this group was set up in May of this year to examine and report on options for the future development of the Eastern Regional Health Authority lands at Grangegorman in Dublin city. The group is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. Its terms of reference are as follows: to examine how the Grangegorman site can best be developed to achieve Government policy priorities in meeting education and social service needs and in tackling construction industry capacity constraints. This will be done in a way which takes into account the overall development of Dublin and leverages the strategic location and commercial potential of the site to attract private involvement on a PPP basis, having particular regard to access by the Dublin Institute of Technology at the earliest possible date to facilities needed for apprenticeship training, with site occupation as from the academic year 2001-02; provision on a staged basis over the longer term of modern campus facilities needed by Dublin Institute of Technology in the context of Government policy for third level education as a whole; provision in the short-term, as part of the package, of non-acute units needed by the ERHA, on part of the campus, but also on other sites in the region, taking account of the investment in kind by the authority; arrangements to afford the local community access to playing field facilities on the campus; integration of the proposed campus development with Luas and other relevant public transport provision; and approach to financing that includes leverage of the site's strategic location and commercial potential to lessen the burden on the Exchequer and avoid circular transfer of funds between Votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Membership of the working group includes representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Public <Col N="1233" /> Enterprise, Health and Children, the Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    <P>The group first met on 16 May, 2001 and has met on five occasions since. I understand that, with the aid of consultants much progress has been made and the group should be able to complete its work and facilitate a report to Government in the near future. The next meeting of the interdepartmental working group is scheduled for 7 November, 2001.</P>

The Grangegorman site is of strategic importance in the context of Dublin as a whole. The Department of Health and Children is working with other Departments and agencies represented on the working group to ensure its strategic location and potential is unlocked to best meet the Government's objectives in the provision of high quality health and education services. I am confident this will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of my constituents have contacted me in the past four weeks in frustration at the way they have been treated by builders who have taken on refurbishment work in their houses. In all cases they are young couples who have taken out large mortgages or loans to upgrade their homes who now find themselves with a botched and unfinished job and the possibility of the need for further extensive rehabilitation work to be carried out on their property.</P>
      <P>In good faith these young people engaged builders whom they considered to be reputable. The builders were registered with the CIF. The customers assumed the builder would deliver a quality product on time for the price agreed. They were not unreasonable in their expectations and they were aware of practical difficulties arising that might delay the work, therefore, they made allowances accordingly. It is understandable that customers are extremely upset when they find themselves the victim of a poor product and told their only recourse is to take a civil action against the builder. These young couples cannot afford to get into further debt with the additional risk of being unsuccessful in a court case. It must be in everyone's interest to ensure there is a quality of service that can be reasonably expected. Recourse to the courts is not an option for people who find themselves with an unfinished poor quality job on their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should consider the need <Col N="1234" /> for a public awareness campaign to advise the public what to look out for and what standards to expect when engaging a builder. When a builder goes out of business or goes bankrupt, the customer is left to pick up the pieces. It seems there is very little easy access to recourse for the consumer or the customer in this case. I want the Minister of State to consider a registration procedure for all builders and only those on a recognised and independently moderated list to be approved. It would also be in the interest of the vast majority of builders who are competent and reliable that such a register process would be established. A second step would be to demand that registered builders would be obliged to have some form of bonding or insurance such as applies to the travel industry, for example. This would ensure that the customer would not suffer financially if the builder was unable to complete a job due to financial default.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an ombudsman who would be independent and impartial would help to reassure people undertaking building work that he or she would mediate in the event of a dispute. There are many precedents in place for such an ombudsman in other industries whose role is to deal impartially with complaints. Rogue builders do enormous damage to the good name of the majority of builders who are reputable and reliable. The victims are often those who are vulnerable because of their financial circumstances and have a right to be protected without having to engage in expensive legal procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter on the Adjournment this evening.</P>
      <P>Home refurbishments are important in satisfying immediate housing needs and in maintaining the quality of the housing stock in the medium to long-term. Subject to compliance with physical planning and building regulation requirements, home improvements operate both in the private interests of householders and in the wider public interest.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton is properly concerned with the consumer aspect of housing improvements. However, it would be impracticable and self-defeating to attempt to bring in a system of independent validation for refurbishment works. Many thousands of such projects, large and small, are undertaken by householders throughout the country. We do not have the financial and manpower resources to operate such a validation system at local or national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of steps householders can take to protect themselves from builders who do shoddy work. First, the householder should retain a competent building professional to draw up a design and specification for the project. The building professional can advise on the selection of a builder to properly complete the refur<Col N="1235" /> bishment works within a reasonable period of time. This professional can also periodically inspect work in progress and certify interim payments on satisfactory completion of the project prior to final payment. Second, the householder should get competitive tenders from a number of builders and check out their track records. Finally, the householder should enter into a written contract with the builder. For example, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland &ndash; RIAI &ndash; has a short form of building contract for domestic work, which has been widely used in the <Col N="1236" /> construction industry for many years. If these precautions are taken, they should minimise the risk of sub-standard refurbishment work. Should problems still arise, however, the contract is enforceable in the courts of law.</P>
    <P>I would advise all householders to carefully approach the refurbishment of their homes along the lines I have suggested. In this way, they can do much to minimise the risk of incomplete and substandard refurbishment work.</P>

      <P>Grants totalling £222,008 were paid to Tralee Beef and Lamb by my Department in 1996. The total comprised two grants of £111,004, one in respect of the abattoir constructed at the premises and the other in respect of the boning hall. The national elements of the grants were £15,000 in both instances with the balance being funded by the EAGGF.

      <P>The closure and receivership of this privately owned company is very regrettable both in terms of the immediate loss of employment and also because of the impact on cattle suppliers, including farmer suppliers, and other creditors who are left in very uncertain circumstances as regards the moneys owed to them.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to provide an estimate of the impact on Irish agriculture arising specifically from the foot and mouth disease experience of 2001. In assessing this, it will be necessary to take account of costs or losses as well as the gains or advantages which accrued as a by-product of the experience of the past months. Some of these elements are still <Col N="1238" /> being played out. In due course, I propose to undertake a review of the different aspects of the episode and this will include an assessment of the implications for the agriculture and related sectors.</P>
      <P>Measures have been introduced in this jurisdiction since 21 February last to prevent the spread of the disease from Britain where to date there have been 2030 cases of the disease and more than 3.9 million animals have been slaughtered. There may be increasing grounds for a degree of optimism in the fact that the most recent confirmed case of FMD in Britain was on 30 September last. Given that we know that FMD can re-emerge in areas which have apparently been cleared of the disease, it is too early to conclude that we have seen the last case of FMD in Britain. We must therefore maintain both our sense of vigilance and the controls and precautionary measures which have played a critical role in our success to date in combating the FMD threat.</P>
      <P>While the range of measures introduced since 21 February has been adjusted on an ongoing basis, a number continue to apply in the interests of safeguarding animal health. The main additional measures still applicable are the following: bans remain on imports of susceptible animals and certain products from Great Britain; imports from Northern Ireland of pigs and sheep are subject to full compliance with EU trading rules; controls continue to apply at ports and airports with mobile patrols at border; with some exemptions, animals purchased must be retained by buyers for 30 days; farm to farm movements of cattle must be notified in advance to SWS; various events involving animals are permitted under specific protocols agreed between the Department and organisers; and sheep shearing and AI are regulated.</P>
      <P>Apart from these measures, I have continued to emphasise the need for retention of effective bio-security and disinfection measures at farms, marts and agricultural premises. I would take this opportunity to again urge all farmers and those in charge of agricultural related premises and events to maintain all the required precautions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>EU regulations governing the payment of animal premiums, area based compensatory allowances in disadvantaged areas, support for the producers of certain arable <Col N="1239" /> crops, support for investment in agricultural holdings, support for the setting up of young farmers, support for agri-environmental measures and support for forestry generally require that farmers have due regard to the environment in their farming activities and adhere to usual good farming practice. Where farmers are in receipt of payments for specific environmental measures they are expected to exceed the standard of usual good farming practice. EU regulations also provide for the imposition of penalties for failure to protect the environment or adhere to other elements of good farming practice.</P>
      <P>In order that farmers would have a clear understanding of the obligations on them and the effect non-observance of the regulations would have on their payments, my Department drew up, in consultation with the farming organisations, a set of minimum standards to be observed by farmers in receipt of EU supports. These standards are set out in a booklet called, <i>Good Farming Practice</i>, and a copy of it was sent to all registered farmers. The booklet also sets out the penalties that will be imposed for breaches of the various aspects of good farming practice and these too were considered in the comprehensive consultations with the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the penalties set out in the booklet are disproportionately heavy in any case. The seriousness of breaches of the various elements of good farming practice were carefully considered by my Department and I believe that the penalties match the seriousness of the offences.</P>

      <P>The objective in international trade negotiations for the further liberalisation of trade in agricultural products is to reduce or eliminate barriers to trade and so provide opportunities for increased international trade. As an established exporter of agricultural products, I am confident that the Irish industry is well placed to exploit such opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from changes in the trading environment which may result from the WTO negotiations and from enlargement of the EU as well as factors such as changing consumer tastes, new food distribution channels, greater concentration at national level and general technological developments, I established a group in June 1999 to make recommendations on the development of <Col N="1240" /> the Irish agriculture and food industries over the present decade. That group's report entitled, Agri Food 2010, was completed in March 2000 and I approved and published a plan of action in August 2000 for the implementation of its recommendations. Funding for many of these recommendations has been provided for in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. As a result, I expect that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to avail of the market opportunities on the domestic and international markets and so maximise their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas over the next ten years.</P>

      <P>Over the last number of years, my Department has monitored the level of twin births to cows. During 2000 and 2001 a number of investigations were conducted where herds with high twinning rates were identified for further investigation. There had been suspicions that the calves in question may have been smuggled into the country from Northern Ireland and improperly identified as Irish animals. However, in the majority of cases investigated, the observed high twinning rates were directly as a result of carelessness by the farmer where he or she admitted registering calves born in the herd as multiple births to one cow rather than as single births to more than one cow. More than sufficient cows were present in these herds, many with no calf registered to them, to account for the total number of calves registered during the calving season. Where necessary, blood sampling for DNA testing was conducted by the farmer in order to determine the true dam of each of the calves in question.</P>
      <P>In summary, the results of investigations to date would suggest that the bulk of high twinning levels arose from careless identification of dams rather than deliberate attempts to defraud the system. Aside from this, there are a small number of cases still under investigation where deliberate misidentification is suspected.</P>
      <P>With effect from January 2001, enhanced validation procedures were incorporated into the calf birth registration process. Since then, any above average incidence of twinning requires the authorisation of the district veterinary office of my Department prior to registration of the animal. I am satisfied that this procedure provides significant additional reassurance that only valid birth registrations are accepted.</P>

      <P>An agreement signed with Libya in June of last year provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand that a number of Irish companies submitted bids at that time. Efforts at diplomatic and technical level are continuing to ensure that the agreement &ndash; in so far as it relates to cattle exports &ndash; signed with Libya last year is fully implemented.</P>
      <P>Although the Iranian market was re-opened in October 1998, there was a delay by the Iranian authorities in approving the veterinary certificate necessary to allow beef exports to Iran to commence. A draft veterinary certificate, prepared on the basis of the agreed protocol, was sent to the Iranian authorities in February 1999. Written confirmation from the Iranian side that the certificate was acceptable was received in April 2000.</P>
      <P>Following acceptance of the veterinary certificate by the Iranian authorities, my main concern has been to ensure that Ireland is included in the list of eligible countries invited to bid for Iranian tenders for the supply of beef, thereby allowing Irish exporters to compete for the available business in this market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the premium system in the cattle sector continues to favour extensive grass based beef production over intensive production. While the special beef premium for bulls was increased by a slightly greater percentage than that for steers in the context of the Agenda 2000 agreement, the total premium on steers, taking the two instalments together, is significantly higher than the single premium for young bulls. In addition, the majority of steers in Ireland are also eligible for the extensification premium at £52 per head where the stocking density it below 1.6 livestock units per hectare or £26 per head where the stocking density is between 1.6 and two livestock units per hectare. Furthermore, under Agenda 2000, land under maize silage was excluded from the calculation of stocking density for the purposes of the extensification premium in order to ensure that intensive producers did not qualify for this premium. Grass based production is also encouraged through the REPS.</P>
      <P>Apart from the rates of payment, the stocking density limit on premium payments also favour extensive over intensive production. The recent decision by the European Union to reduce this limit from two livestock units per hectare at present to 1.8 livestock units per hectare in 2003 will impact much more severely on intensive producers of young bull beef than on grass based production.</P>
      <P>I will maintain the approach that EU policy continues to favour grass based beef production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 151, 155, 159, 230 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government gave a commitment for a targeted investment programme in both urban and rural disadvantaged areas. CLÁR is the programme for revitalising rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have selected 16 areas to participate in the programme. My primary criterion for selecting areas was the greatest percentage loss of population between 1926 and 1996. No examination was carried out on population change over the last 150 years by my Department to date. These are, in general, the areas experiencing the most rural degeneration with a constant decline in population, withdrawal of services and high dependency ratios. However, I have also included the area which had a full cull of livestock due to foot and mouth disease recently, the Cooley <Col N="1244" /> Peninsula. The areas selected include parts of all the counties of Connacht-Ulster, parts of five counties in Munster and parts of four counties in Leinster. The average population loss in all these areas is 50% and the total population that will benefit from the programme is 283,000.</P>
    <P>I will convey separately to Deputy Farrelly the areas of north Meath covered by the programme.</P>
    <P>The aim of CLÁR is to assist rural regeneration in the 16 areas. We will do this through measures to develop the physical, social and community infrastructure there. The CLÁR programme will accelerate the investments under the national development plan in order to tackle the decline in the regions identified. Consequently the primary funding will come from money already committed in the national development plan. In addition, as recently announced by the Taoiseach, I will have £20 million over the period 2002 and 2003 to underpin the success of the programme.</P>
    <P>These three measures clearly illustrate the Government's commitment to tackling social exclusion. I intend that this programme will operate using existing structures and working closely with State agencies and complement the range of initiatives and programmes already in place.</P>
    <P>Since this programme focuses very much on priority of investment under the national development plan, the actions identified will mirror very closely the various investment programmes in the NDP and will also have regard to existing plans for the regions. A lot of planning work has already been done by agencies such as the county development boards, the regional assemblies, the regional and local authorities, the Western Development Commission, Leader Groups and ADM partnerships.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I do not intend to waste any more time than is absolutely necessary to get the programme up and running. Following the launch on 5 October I am now arranging over the coming weeks, to meet with local interests in all the areas selected on the identification of their needs under the programme. I will conclude my visit to each area by hosting a public meeting where the public will be briefed on what is proposed and given a chance to make their contribution.</P>
    <P>Following these meetings I will draw up an action plan for each area which will be agreed with other relevant Departments. My aim is to complete this phase of the programme by the end of this year and that investment to these areas can begin to flow in 2002.</P>
    <P>I believe that the priorities identified by the communities in the areas selected can be accommodated thus leading to an alleviation of population decline, disadvantage and sense of loss of community that has, for so long, been a feature of these regions.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission's State of the West report is a very useful document as it outlines in detail the work that needs to be done to level the development playing pitch and to ensure that the west achieves its full potential. <Col N="1245" /> The report makes three key recommendations, one in relation to roads, one in relation to power and telecommunications and one in relation to an investment programme in towns.</P>
    <P>The CLÁR initiative focuses on many of the areas and issues highlighted in the report as well as on the reprioritisation of spending under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the need for a strategic response to the provision of infrastructure. As part of the CLÁR initiative and in response to the report, the interdepartmental committee on rural development has been re-established.</P>
    <P>As regards the third recommendation on the need to invest in town infrastructure, a portion of the additional £20 million under CLÁR, along with finance from other statutory agencies, will be used to progress this objective.</P>

      <P>There were some unavoidable delays in pre-approval inspections in the earlier part of this year, primarily caused by the restrictions on farm visits that were essential to curtail the threat of foot and mouth disease.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped (lowland) &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped (lowland) &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>Where a farmer farms a combination of land categories he will be paid on more severely handicapped lowland first, less severely handicapped lowland next and the mountain grazings last.</P>
      <P>If a farmer only has more severely handicapped lowland and-or less severely handicapped lowland his overall limit is 45 hectares. If he has a combination of more severely handicapped lowland and-or less severely handicapped lowland and some mountain type land, he will be paid on up to 45 hectares of lowland and up to an extra 15 hectares of mountain subject to an overall limit of 60 hectares. If a farmer has only mountain type land his overall limit is 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements involve a cost of about £180 million in 2001 representing an increase of about £60 million over the old animal based headage scheme. It is now estimated that about 72,000 farmers stand to gain from these new arrangements, while some 27,000 farmers stood to lose money when compared with payments under the old animal based headage schemes. However, I negotiated a compensation package with the European Commission under which 90% of any loss would be made good this year. The payments now being made to farmers include this compensation for losses in appropriate cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that payments under <Col N="1247" /> the new scheme commenced on 21 September, as agreed in the Protocol on Direct Payments to Farmers and to date over £152 million has been paid to some 88,000 farmers representing almost 90% of total applicants. This compares very favourably with the figure of just over £72 million which was paid to farmers at this time last year under the old animal based headage schemes.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulty which mountain classification causes for some farmers under the new area based compensatory allowance scheme and I have carried out a review of the scheme with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land. In this connection I have recently made a formal submission to Brussels seeking approval for a revision of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should point out however that many farmers with mountain type land particularly those with sheep only or those who, because of their farming enterprise, were limited to payment on 30 livestock units under the old animal based system are in fact gaining substantially under the new scheme.</P>

    <P>The production of sugar in all member states of the EU is regulated by the EU sugar regime which specifies a sugar quota for each member state. The regime provides that the quota is allocated to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state's territory. In Ireland's case the sugar quota is 196,000 tonnes and is allocated to Irish Sugar plc. The company places contracts with approximately 4,000 farmers to grow sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota. It is estimated that the value of the beet production to farmers is about £60 million annually.</P>
    <P>The EU sugar regime which has operated since 1968 expired on 30 June 2001.

      <P>As part of a general reorganisation my Department's FEOGA operations have been brought together into two functional units, direct payments and market supports, forming one group, the agriculture payments group, which is dedicated to and accountable for the efficient delivery of agriculture payments. Work practices and control procedures have been strengthened with the support of modern IT systems and best practice in auditing and control. Most of the required restructuring in terms of staff deployment and reporting arrangements have been completed. The group will ensure focused and cost effective management of the funds in question, reconciling the need to provide a quality service to clients and rigorous accountability for the funds under its control. I believe that significant improvements have been achieved in the delivery of FEOGA payments.</P>
      <P>The process of reorganising the Department is on-going in the light of changing demands and the evolution of agricultural policies at EU and national level. I will continue to review what further structural framework, if any, would be required, in the context of the substantial organisational changes already made, to ensure that my commitment to the delivery of the most efficient, effective and accountable FEOGA payments service is honoured.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recently published findings of the AgriAware survey on perceptions of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general the survey was very positive in relation to the perception of Irish agriculture and Irish agricultural products. Over 60% of those surveyed ranked agriculture of vital importance to our economy. A substantial majority of respondents, over 85%, indicated that the image <Col N="1249" /> of agriculture is positive. While almost 46% of those surveyed felt the image had disimproved in the last five years, the majority, over 54%, felt it had improved or remained unchanged. The reasons identified in the survey for the perception of a disimproved image varied from disease scares, pollution-environmental damage to</P>
    <P>modernisation and technology.</P>
    <P>My Department is and has been has been active in addressing these issues, for example, in its work in promoting animal health, food safety, greater traceability and greater participation in the rural environment protection scheme. The farming community and its representative bodies also have a key responsibility in maintaining the good image of the sector.</P>

      <P>In general terms, the Egyptian authorities have indicated that they will permit beef imports on condition that the beef is derived from cattle aged 24 months or less and from which the specified risk material has been removed. Furthermore, those cattle must be fully traceable, must test negatively for BSE, must never have been fed ruminant MBM and must only come from farms in which no case of BSE has occurred in the past three years. Deputies will be aware that BSE controls in place in Ireland <Col N="1250" /> over the past number of years mean that the Egyptian requirements relating to traceability, BSE testing, MBM and so on, are fully met by our existing controls. As regards age, the fact is that a similar condition is not new within the Egyptian requirements and, as with all such conditions, much will depend on how it is applied in practice.</P>
      <P>Contacts are taking place in Cairo between importers and the Egyptian authorities about detailed arrangements for the import of beef from Ireland. I understand a number of applications for import licences have been submitted to the Egyptian authorities. I am hopeful that they will very soon throw light on how the Egyptians will apply these conditions in practice so that exporters can move on to the next phase of concluding contracts for sales of Irish beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The application process for the various direct payment schemes has undergone substantial simplification over the past few years. The introduction of printed cattle identification documents &ndash; passports &ndash; and the use of associated bar-coding has facilitated a very major simplification of the application forms for the special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes. Farmers are being paid their entitlements under the new slaughter premium scheme without the need for any application. Payment is being made using information held on the Department's computerised database, CMMS. In addition, the process has been further simplified this year by the introduction of the new area based compensatory allowance scheme which replaces five animal based schemes under the old animal based headage regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new IT strategy was produced for my Department last year. This strategy recognises the importance of the effective use of information technology in the delivery of our schemes and services to all of our customers and it sets out a plan for the redevelopment of all the major systems in use in my Department over a five year period. A significant part of this strategy is the <Col N="1251" /> re-development of the systems dealing with direct payments to farmers. When redeveloped it is envisaged that the new systems will be capable of being used for direct on-line scheme application submission by farmers.</P>
    <P>In so far as penalties and simplification of the CAP generally is concerned, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness my Department is committed to pressing the European Commission to re-examine the penalty regime with particular reference to exclusion penalties applicable to direct payment schemes and to apply the maximum proportionality in the imposition of all penalties. In this connection the Agriculture Council, at a meeting in October 2000, reaffirmed its commitment to simplification generally including the simplification of the penalty regime. The Commission subsequently set up a working group to look at the whole question of simplification. Ireland is represented on that working group together with other member states. One of the areas which the working group is examining is the question of introducing a new scheme for paying small amounts of aid to</P>
    <P>farmers with a maximum total entitlement of 1,250. The group is also examining the regulation governing the integrated administration and control system with particular reference to the impact of penalties. It is expected that the working group will finalise its deliberations in the near future after which a new Commission regulation will be adopted.</P>
    <P>Given the overall value of the various direct payments schemes to farmers in Ireland and the fact that these payments are increasing in value following from the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, it is inevitable that the European Commission wish to ensure that reasonable controls and deterrents are in place in the various member states for the operation of the schemes and that this is adequate protection of taxpayers' funds.</P>

      <P>The national farm survey shows average family farm income for full-time farmers, as defined by Teagasc, was £21,663 in 2000, a 26% increase on 1999, while family farm income from part-time farms averaged £4,915, an increase of 36% on 1999. Part-time farmers who held off-farm employment had an average income of £20,300 made up of £16,000 from off-farm earnings and £4,300 from farm income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to farms with a farm income of less than £10,000, 86% are part-time. It is important <Col N="1252" /> to note that, on 96% of all part-time farms in the survey, the farmer and-or spouse had some other source of income, from off-farm employment, pension or social assistance.</P>
    <P>I am aware that low income remains a difficulty for some farm families. Therefore my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, introduced the farm assist scheme in 1999 and there are now over 8,200 low income families receiving support under this scheme. In addition the Government and the EU support the incomes of all farmers through public expenditure on the agri-food sector, which in 2000 amounted to over £2 billion. The scale of this assistance to the sector clearly underlines the commitment of the Government and the EU to supporting farm incomes. This expenditure includes direct payments to farmers, which have increased significantly in recent years due both to the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms and increased Exchequer spending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 157 cases of BSE have been confirmed in 2001 to date &ndash; up to 18 October &ndash; compared to 101 to the end of October 2000. In addition three positive cohort animals have been detected.</P>
      <P>In 2001, 81 cases have been detected through traditional passive surveillance and 76 cases through active surveillance. Of the cases identified through active surveillance, 53 were fallen animals identified in knackeries, 21 were over 30 month animals in meat plants and two were casualty animals also at meat plants. The entire increase in 2001 is, therefore, attributable to more intensive active surveillance, particularly among fallen animals which would not, in any event, have entered the human food chain.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that a comprehensive range of measures is in place for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herds, the tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals. In addition all cattle presented for slaughter over 30 months of age are tested for BSE and all fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age are also tested for the disease.</P>
      <P>Moreover, unlike many other member states whose BSE controls were tightened up at the end of 1999, none of the positive animals identified in Ireland to date have been born after May 1996. This indicates that the enhanced controls introduced in this country in 1996 are working, and that the disease should begin to work its way out of the national herd as animals born prior to 1996 leave the system.</P>

    <P>An agreement signed with Libya in June of last year provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan foreign minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand that a number of Irish companies submitted bids at that time. Efforts at diplomatic and technical level are continuing to ensure that the agreement &ndash; in so far as it relates to cattle exports &ndash; signed with Libya last year is fully implemented.</P>
    <P>With regard to live cattle exports to Egypt the position is that proposals for a trial shipment of live cattle were submitted to the Egyptian authorities in late 1997 but these proposals were not implemented. The lack of a market for live cattle exports to Egypt has been, however, more than offset by the volume of trade in beef exports to that country in recent years. The recent decision by the Egyptian authorities to provide for exceptions to the ban on European beef imports for countries which can meet certain conditions in relation to BSE is a welcome development for Irish cattle and beef sectors in view of the fact that these conditions largely reflect the way in which BSE is controlled in this country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 132, 135 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>My Department was in touch with the EU Commission about this problem well before June of this year. A formal written application to amend the State Aid approval was in fact made on 4 April 2001, some months before the ceiling for payments was reached. Since then my Department has been in constant communication with the Commission services, supplying additional material as requested and addressing the various concerns that are always present when there is any question of raising the ceiling on state aids. Officials of my Department travelled to Brussels in September to ensure that everything had been supplied to the Commission's satisfaction and were assured that this was the case and that all that remained was to process the application formally through the different levels of procedures laid down for internal and inter-service consultation. This procedure closed at the end of last week and I expect to have the formal written approval within the next day or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just over 650 applicants await payment under this scheme. I have in previous replies explained that there is no provision for the payment of interest in cases like this. The Prompt Payment of Accounts Act referred to by Deputy Penrose is <Col N="1257" /> not intended to cover payment of grant-aid, which may be delayed for any number of reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The outbreak of foot and mouth disease at Proleek on the Cooley Peninsula made it necessary to cull susceptible animals on the peninsula in order to prevent the disease spreading to livestock in other areas of County Louth and farther afield.</P>
      <P>Some 280 flocks and herds were depopulated on the Cooley Peninsula in the course of the cull. In so far as sheep were concerned, valuations were carried out to fix a market value on each flock as the basis for compensation as provided by law. Initial valuations tended to conform with &ldquo;ready reckoners&rdquo; used by the Department's own valuers. As matters progressed it became necessary for outside valuers to be drawn in to speed up the whole process. Their valuations were seen by local flockowners as more generous than valuations carried out by Department personnel. Roughly speaking, those whose animals were taken in the latter part of the exercise tended to be satisfied, while flockowners whose animals were valued and taken at an earlier stage felt aggrieved.</P>
      <P>Following earlier exchanges with IFA at local level, it was agreed that the cases of flockowners who fell into this category would be reviewed. This led to a review of 182 cases. This exercise resulted in supplementary payments being made in 148 or 81% of these cases. Individual supplementary payments ranged from £80 to £22,535 and totalled £415, 000. This was additional to payments of some £3.4 million already made to the flockowners in question on foot of the initial valuations.</P>
      <P>A meeting in late September with officials of my Department, an IFA delegation, which included a number of local flockowners, put forward certain alternative propositions for consideration. These are at present under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, while again acknowledging the particular difficulties experienced by flockowners on the Cooley Peninsula, I think it is important to record the fact that over the past eight months sacrifices, including financial sacrifices, were made by many hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life throughout this country in the battle against FMD. Many of those concerned had no direct involvement in farming and it is appropriate that we once again put on record our <Col N="1258" /> appreciation of the sacrifices which they made in the national interest.</P>

      <P>My function in relation to beef export markets is to ensure that exporters have unrestricted access to those markets. In the case of Egypt, the recent decision by the authorities there to extend the existing ban but to make exceptions for countries which meet certain conditions in relation to BSE was a recognition of their satisfaction with the manner in which BSE is controlled in Ireland. Given the traditional importance of the market to us, this is a significant boost to the cattle and beef sectors here and follows on an intensive campaign at political, diplomatic and technical levels to have the market re-opened. Competing for contracts is a commercial matter for the exporters involved and it is not possible to speculate as to the amount and value of beef likely to be exported to Egypt over the next 12 months. In 1999 some 157,000 tonnes of beef &ndash; worth over £200 million &ndash; were exported to Egypt. Naturally, I would hope that trade could very soon reach previously achieved levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the launch of the TB eradication scheme in 1954, and the brucellosis eradication scheme in 1966, the combined expenditure for both schemes has totalled £954 million excluding administration costs, up to the end of 2000. The receipts for the same period totalled £429 million leaving a net expenditure of £525 million.</P>
      <P>The initial policy when the TB scheme was introduced in 1954 was to eradicate bovine TB from cattle herds and this still remains the objective. Significant progress was made in the earlier stages of the scheme but the programme has stalled, albeit, at a relatively low level of the disease. However, given the experience in the past 30 years there is a recognition that the incidence of the disease in wildlife is a major impediment and that further technological advances will be needed to achieve further progress. An important short-term objective is to ensure that the incidence of the disease is reduced to an acceptable minimum so that markets, in particular export markets, are not jeopardised and so that there is no serious threat to human health. These two objectives are being fully achieved.</P>
      <P>Good progress was made in eradicating brucellosis in the initial 20 years of the programme up to 1986, but there were setbacks in the programme over the next decade. The programme to combat the disease was again stepped up in 1997 and significant progress has been made since in reducing the incidence of the disease with the number of herds restricted to date in 2001 being less than 50% of the corresponding period in 1998.</P>
      <P>In the context of the PPF, a package of measures was agreed with the objectives of reducing the incidence of TB by 50% and of making significant progress towards eradicating brucellosis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The expert group was established on 9 March 2001 to consider the extensive range of foot and mouth disease measures then in place and to advise on the <Col N="1260" /> appropriateness of adapting them to developments as they occurred. The group remains on call to provide advice to the Minister as required.</P>
      <P>In my view, this group has performed a very valuable role since its establishment and it remains for the time being in existence and available to continue in its role for so long as FMD remains an issue.</P>
      <P>Measures have been introduced in this jurisdiction since 21 February last to prevent the spread of the disease from Britain where to date there have been 2030 cases of the disease and more than 3.9 million animals have been slaughtered. There may be increasing grounds for a degree of optimism in the fact that the most recent confirmed case of FMD in Britain was on 30 September last. Given that we know that FMD can re-emerge in areas which have apparently been cleared of the disease, it is too early to conclude that we have seen the last case of FMD in Britain. We must therefore maintain both our sense of vigilance and the controls and precautionary measures which have played a critical role in our success to date in combating the FMD threat.</P>
      <P>While the range of measures introduced since 21 February has been adjusted on an ongoing basis, a number continue to apply in the interests of safeguarding animal health. The main additional measures still applicable are the following: bans remain on imports of susceptible animals and certain products from Great Britain; imports from Northern Ireland of pigs and sheep are subject to full compliance with EU trading rules; controls continue to apply at ports and airports with mobile patrols at the border; with some exemptions, animals purchased must be retained by buyers for 30 days; farm to farm movements of cattle must be notified in advance to SWS; various events involving animals are permitted under specific protocols agreed between the Department and organisers; sheep shearing and AI are regulated.</P>
      <P>Apart from these measures, I have continued to emphasise the need for retention of effective bio-security and disinfection measures at farms, marts and agricultural premises. I would take this opportunity to again urge all farmers and those in charge of agricultural related premises and events to maintain all the required precautions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced to the House in March of this year my intention to introduce a comprehensive system of identification and traceability for the national sheep flock. The first elements of the new system were in place within two months, with flockowners able to order and receive tags from approved suppliers. The national sheep identification system, NSIS, as a whole went &ldquo;live&rdquo; on 21 June. This means that, for the first time, Ireland has full traceability of all sheep, on an individual animal basis. Every sheep which moves from a holding within the State or which is imported into the State and every sheep carcass processed in any of our processing plants is now fully and individually identified. All sheep remaining on holdings are required to be individually tagged by 15 December next. I attach great importance to this development which is of significant benefit to the sheep sector, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum. Many flockowners are already beginning to appreciate the benefits of individual tagging for flock management purposes also.</P>
      <P>My Department is monitoring the implementation of NSIS on an ongoing basis and I am pleased to report that the system is working well and that sheep presented in marts and factories are properly tagged and documented. I look forward to full compliance by flockowners with the requirement that all sheep remaining on holdings are tagged no later than 15 December next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date more than 8 million tags have been issued by approved suppliers to over 40,000 flockowners. I have already said that while I regard the introduction of NSIS as a major <Col N="1263" /> achievement, I regard it as a system which can be built upon and which can evolve in line with technological advances and the requirements of the sector as a whole.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that a system is put in place whereby people who include commonage land with proven rights in their area aid applications do not have their payments delayed each year; and if he will examine the case of a person (details supplied) in County Waterford and indicate when payment will issue.</Quest>

      <P>In general delays in processing area aid applications which involve commonages are caused by overclaims. These arise either where new applicants are claiming commonage rights or where existing claimants are incorrectly increasing their claims. This results in the overall claims exceeding the area of the commonage with consequent delays in processing area aid applications for the herdowners involved in the commonage.</P>
      <P>In cases where commonage overclaims arise the area aid unit of my Department has to get in touch with each new applicant or the applicant increasing his or her share, to determine whether or not a valid claim can be established. In cases where area aid applicants are found to have proof of an entitlement to a commonage their applications are cleared for payment purposes.</P>
      <P>Where herdowners fail to produce documentary evidence to support their claims to a share of a given commonage, they are given a reasonable period to respond after which their claims are rejected.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for 5.21 hectares of commonage in his area aid application and this area has now been cleared. The payments due will issue to him shortly. The delay was due to a new applicant applying on the commonage in question and another applicant increasing his share.</P>
      <P>There are particular problems in processing commonage cases where overclaims arise. My officials are examining the processing arrangements with a view to ensuring that any delays are minimised in all such cases.</P>

      <P>Nitrogen is an important and essential element in the pro<Col N="1264" /> duction of crops. Nitrate based fertiliser is an efficient chemical form through which crops can assimilate nitrogen. There are also other chemical forms of nitrogenous fertilisers which may be converted to the nitrate form in the soil-plant environment. EU and national legislation on the marketing of fertilisers lays down criteria on the formulation and labelling of fertilisers manufactured for sale. The seller is required to give the purchaser, <i>inter alia</i>, a statement showing the analysis of the material. Manufacturers and retailers of fertilisers are under regular supervision by inspectors of my Department to ensure full compliance with their legal obligations and requirements in this area.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department promotes the responsible use of fertilisers in a number of ways. Under the rural environment protection scheme there is a requirement to operate a nutrient management plan. The plan requires the efficient use of nutrients in an environmentally friendly manner. Farmers are encouraged to follow advice from Teagasc and advice in the recently published <i>Good Farming Practice</i> booklet, regarding use of nutrients including nitrogen. Farmers participation in many of the schemes operated by my Department must comply with good farming practice to qualify for aid. Farmers are also encouraged to maximise use of nutrients, including nitrogen in organic wastes produced on the farm. If nitrogenous fertilisers are applied in accordance with the requirements of the REP scheme or good farming practice this will provide sufficient protection for the environment. In the circumstances, I have no specific plans to promote alternatives to the use of fertilisers containing nitrogen in the form of nitrate.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of this Government that every export market should be open to Irish beef and no effort is being spared by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs or An Bord Bia to bring this about. Each of our important export markets, particularly Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, is being dealt with in whatever way is most appropriate to the circumstances prevailing in that market. The strategy adopted in each case is kept under constant review by my Department having regard to advice from our embassies on the ground and from An Bord Bia. Opportunities afforded by ministerial visits to the region were availed of to press Ireland's case for a reopening of those markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, a senior veterinary official of my Department visited Saudi Arabia and a number <Col N="1265" /> of Gulf states to follow up on earlier contacts with the relevant authorities in those countries to brief them on the many layers of BSE controls in place in Ireland and the guarantees those controls offer to consumers of Irish beef. Within the past ten days, meetings were held in the Irish Embassy in Riyadh with the importing agencies with a view to progressing the effort to reopen the market. This was attended by an An Bord Bia representative from Dublin. We will continue to press for re-opening of beef markets at every possible opportunity and I am confident that our recent success with the Egyptian market, our largest market, will encourage other markets in the region to follow suit.</P>

      <P>The report referred to relates to a paper published in the <i>Journal of Veterinary and Human Toxicology</i> in 1998. This paper described the post-mortem findings in six horses submitted to the equine centre from a farm in Askeaton, County Limerick, between December 1995 and July 1997. The authors of the paper claimed that lesions were due to aluminum toxicity and that the uptake of the latter had been facilitated by acid rain in the area. The claims raised were discussed at a meeting in 1998 between the authors of the paper, representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and the other agencies. At that meeting it was pointed out by Environmental Protection Agency representatives that intensive environmental monitoring had shown no evidence that the region has been subject either to acid rain or aluminium pollution.</P>
      <P>My Department, in the <i>Journal of Veterinary and Human Toxicology</i> in 1999, gave a detailed response to the claims of the paper published. This response highlighted the lack of credible evidence presented by the authors in support of their claims regarding aluminium involvement and suggested that many of the lesions described could be attributed to the effects of parasitism. Furthermore, officials of my Department offered to meet with the authors in 1998 and 1999 to discuss this issue in further detail but to date, the authors have been unavailable for a meeting.</P>

      <P>The European Union <Col N="1266" /> participates in the World Trade Organisation negotiations as a single entity with the EU Commission conducting the negotiations in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. The EU negotiating mandate for agriculture was adopted by the EU Council of agriculture ministers on 27 September 1999 and confirmed subsequently by the General Affairs Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>The main points of the mandate are:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the negotiations on agriculture will be based on the principles enshrined in Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture under the Uruguay Round which recognises &ldquo;that the long-term objective of substantial progressive reductions in support and protection resulting in fundamental reform is an on-going process&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the EU position will be based on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999; </P>
      <P>&ndash;the EU will be prepared to negotiate reductions in support provided the concept of the &ldquo;blue and green&rdquo; boxes will continue;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the EU is prepared to negotiate reductions in export subsidies provided that all such support, especially export credits and less transparent forms of export support, is treated on an equal basis;</P>
      <P>&ndash;similar instruments to the Peace Clause and the Special Safeguard Clause will be needed in the future;</P>
      <P>&ndash;an appropriate balance will be sought between trade and non-trade issues; the EU will seek recognition for the multifunctional role of agriculture, and for the EU's high standards of food safety, food quality and animal welfare, and</P>
      <P>&ndash;the EU will actively promote special and differential treatment for developing countries, especially for the least developed countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a particular interest in the outcome of the forthcoming negotiations especially in so far as export refunds and direct payments are concerned. I am satisfied that the EU's negotiating mandate provides a satisfactory framework for protecting the interests of the Irish agriculture and food industries.</P>

      <P>No BSE related restrictions on Irish beef or beef products have been imposed by the EU Commission or by any individual member state of the EU. I am satisfied, therefore, that beef exports have ready access to all EU markets. Producer prices for beef vary throughout the EU depending on grade and market conditions. Irish prices have generally been lower than the EU average because of our surplus of beef production of which only 10% can be accommodated on the home market. However during 2001 prices paid here have exceeded those in a number of member states.</P>

      <P>There have been 737 confirmed cases of BSE to date &ndash; up to 18 <Col N="1268" /> October &ndash; since 1989. Of this total, 157 cases have been confirmed in 2001 to date. In addition 3 positive cohort animals have been detected in 2001. The increase in 2001 is attributable to more intensive active surveillance, particularly among fallen animals which would not, in any event, have entered the human food chain. This year, 81 cases have been detected through traditional passive surveillance and 76 cases through active surveillance. Of the cases identified through active surveillance, 53 were fallen animals identified in knackeries, 21 were over 30-month animals in meat plants and 2 were casualty animals also at meat plants.</P>
      <P>My Department has a comprehensive range of measures in place for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herds, the tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals. In addition all cattle over 30 months of age presented for slaughter are tested for BSE and all fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age are also tested for the disease. Moreover, unlike many other member states whose BSE controls were tightened up at the end of 1999, none of the positive animals identified in Ireland to date have been born after May 1996. This indicates that the enhanced controls introduced in this country in 1996 are working, and that the disease should begin to work its way out of the national herd as older cattle leave the system.</P>
      <P>In relation to depopulation, my Department's policy is to depopulate herds and cohorts as quickly as possible once agreement is reached on valuation. Compensation is based on full market value for the animals.</P>

      <P>During the course of the foot and mouth disease crisis on the island of Ireland, trade in pigs and other susceptible species between Northern Ireland this jurisdiction was prohibited. Trade in live animals, including pigs, between member states of the European Union, is governed by EU legislation requiring, <i>inter alia</i>, that animals must be accompanied by appropriate health certification and must be properly identified. Prior to the foot and mouth crisis, special <Col N="1269" /> arrangements were established by bilateral agreement with the Northern Ireland authorities,</P>
      <P>which exempted trade in pigs and sheep on the island from the full rigour of normal intra-community trade requirements. Since the resumption of trade in certain live animals between the North and the Republic, and in the context of an animal health crisis which had the potential to do untold long-term damage to the agricultural economy, and indeed to many other sectors of the economy, it has been agreed that in the future normal intra-community rules should apply to trade in live animals.</P>
      <P>For the future, therefore, full intra-community trade rules will apply to cross-Border trade in live animals. Within the parameters of those rules, which operate successfully throughout the European Union, my Department will do everything in its power to facilitate the trade in pigs to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The position is that as a result of discrepancies found in the Cooley Peninsula during the FMD cull of sheep, my Department put in place additional controls under the 2001 ewe premium scheme. These controls involved documentary and other checks which were conducted on the spot or by administrative means. In conducting these controls my Department paid particular attention to producers selected for on-farm inspection under the 2001 scheme but where the inspection could not be carried out because of FMD restrictions, pro<Col N="1270" /> ducers residing with a 10km radius of the Border and producers who moved sheep to slaughter under permit issued by Teagasc in the period from 6 March to 7 April when the retention period under the 2001 ewe premium scheme ended.</P>
      <P>While most of these control measures have now been completed there are a number of cases where investigations are still ongoing or where individual applicants are disputing the results of the control measures. I am not, therefore, in a position to give the final outcome of the exercise. My Department will be conducting an in-depth analysis of the results of these controls later this year with a view to establishing the overall level of discrepancies found. I point out, however that payment of the first instalment of the 2001 ewe premium issued in July last and to date some 94% of applicants have received a payment. The total amount paid under the first instalment is £27.5 million. Payment of the second instalment was made last week when over £10 million was paid to 93% of applicants bringing total payments under the 2001 ewe premium scheme to £37.5 million.</P>

      <P>Under EU beef labelling regulations introduced in September 2000, operators involved in the production or marketing of beef are obliged to label that beef with a reference code to enable the beef be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived, the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located, and the approval number of the cutting plant and member state or third country in which it is located.</P>
      <P>It is possible, although not the norm, for the factories to import carcases for deboning subject to their being accompanied by appropriate veterinary certification. In any such case, the law requires the factory to state on its labelling the member state or third country where the animal was slaughtered in addition to stating that the beef was deboned in this country.</P>
      <P>Export factories are supervised by veterinary officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and are subject to ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with this labelling requirement. I am satisfied that the provisions outlined are fully controlled.</P>

      <P>A total of 278,025 animals were slaughtered under the EU purchase for destruction scheme, which ended on 30 June 2001, at a total cost of approximately £198 million, consisting of purchasing costs of £160 million and operating costs of £38 million. Under the special purchase scheme, SPS, tenders for 35,481 tonnes of beef have been accepted to date by the European Commission from Ireland at an estimated value of £51 million while expenditure on the operating costs of the SPS to date has amounted to approximately £4 million.</P>
      <P>By virtue of the EU regulation governing the SPS, member states have the options of rendering the meat or storing it in bone-in or boneless form or in the form of canned products. I am examining the possibilities of storing some of the meat purchased under the scheme in canned form. The distribution of such canned meat in the manner suggested or for other purposes would be subject to the prior approval of the European Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Scrapie is not a new disease in sheep and has been recorded for over 200 years. Since 1990, scrapie has been identified here in over 120 flocks out of a national total of more than 40,000 flocks. My Department has been active for the past decade in the detection, monitoring and control of scrapie. Our approach has been guided primarily by public health considerations, developed within the framework of measures to address transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, generally and based on the best available current scientific research and knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures taken by my Department over the past decade which are relevant to scrapie are as follows: flock owners are obliged by law to notify the Department of suspected cases of scrapie &ndash; these animals are tested by the veterinary laboratory service and destroyed if positive; the feeding to ruminants, including sheep, of meat and bone meal has been banned since 1990, and controls in this area were significantly strengthened in 1996; controls of specified risk material covering both cattle and sheep were unilaterally introduced in 1997; since 1998, the Department has maintained a programme of active scrapie surveillance, which involves random testing of <Col N="1273" /> 8,000 samples at meat factories &ndash; plans have been made to increase this programme to 15,000 samples from 1 January 2002 and the necessary preparatory work has been going on for some time; a genotyping project, aimed at identifying the best means of breeding scrapie out of the national flock, has been undertaken since 1999 &ndash; this involves assessing the feasibility of breeding genetic resistance to the disease; a national sheep identification system which involves the individual identification and traceability of the entire national flock was introduced in June 2001 &ndash; this will facilitate more precise control and monitoring measures than ever before in relation to diseases, including scrapie, in sheep; restriction on the movement of sheep from flocks in which</P>
    <P>scrapie has been confirmed.</P>
    <P>The only definitive mechanism for differentiating between BSE and scrapie is the animal bioassay test which involves inoculating susceptible animals, usually mice with a particular susceptibility to BSE, with infective brain tissue from sheep infected with scrapie, and waiting for approximately two years until the mouse develops a TSE. This was the basis of well-publicised research in the UK, which appears to have been undermined by the revelation that the infective sample used was a bovine rather than an ovine sample. Strain-typing work carried out in Ireland has not given rise to any specific concerns about the possible presence of BSE in the national flock.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, and against the background of concern about TSEs in Europe, it is now being considered that we should depopulate those flocks in which scrapie has been confirmed in the past three years. To date 39 flocks have been movement restricted, 34 with a view to depopulation and five to be included in the scrapie research programme. The Department will be examining a further 87 flocks which were scrapie-positive prior to 1999. Depopulation of the 34 flocks will occur as soon as possible after the valuation process has been completed and suitable arrangements have been put in place to compensate flock owners affected by this decision.</P>
    <P>If new scientific research emerges which indicates the desirability of adjusting or augmenting any of these measures, any necessary actions will <Col N="1274" /> be taken, as has consistently been the case heretofore.</P>

      <P>The World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS, was adopted at the conclusion of the Uruguay round of trade negotiations in 1994. The GATS agreement, which came into force in 1995, sets out a framework of legally binding rules governing the conduct of world trade in services. It is supported by a number of schedules of specific commitments undertaken by individual WTO members which determine the level of access to their domestic market by foreign suppliers. Each member is free to choose the particular services which it wishes to liberalise.</P>
      <P>Ireland is already meeting its obligations under GATS. There is no obligation in the GATS which requires Governments to privatise public services or to sell off entities such as those mentioned in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain essential services currently provided by participants on community employment, CE, are being mainstreamed. The mainstreaming involves the transfer of CE funding for schools services such as secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants to the Department of Education and Science. After an appropriate transition period to allow participants work out their contracts in schools, such services will be solely the responsibility of that Department. Arising from these changes, an additional £46 million is to be made directly available to schools on an annual basis, phased in by 2003, for the purposes of providing replacement services in schools. It is envisaged that this additional funding will enable schools to substantially improve the level of secretarial and caretaking supports that are currently in place and will provide opportunities for employment for CE participants and other long-term unemployed persons. CE participants currently working in schools will be facilitated in completing their full engagement in their school project, which for some participants may be for a period of up to three years.</P>
      <P>I consider the phased reductions in the numbers employed on CE as set out in the PPF, and the reductions that will result from the mainstreaming of schools and certain other CE services to be appropriate. Every effort will be made to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>The events in New York on 11 September will lead to greatly increased costs for re-insurers and director insurers in both Europe and the United States. This can be expected to result in higher premiums for all consumers of insurance, both private and commercial. EU law prevents me from intervening in the pricing or underwriting decisions of insurance undertakings. The cost of insurance in Ireland has been the subject of extensive research by our Department. It is clear the high cost of insurance in Ireland is linked to the high cost of claims. The Government has decided to establish a personal injuries assessment board with a view to reducing the costs of delivery of compensation in personal injury cases. I understand that such costs are now running at more than 40% of the cost of claims. An interdepartmental implementation group is considering how the PIAB may be established. It is expected to report at the end of the year.</P>

The stocking rate for broad leafed trees ranges up to 250% of the conifer stocking rate and should be taken only as an indication that more broad leafed trees are planted by hectare. It has no bearing on planting targets.</P>
    <P>During October, my Department held two information days for stakeholders in the forestry sector on the application of the suite of five environmental guidelines, including landscape and biodiversity guidelines, launched last year. These information days had two primary objectives to inform stakeholders about the content and background to the suite of guidelines, and to receive feedback from those in attendance.</P>
    <P>The two days were very successful, both in terms of the number of people who attended and the quality of discussion. There was widespread support at the meetings for the general thrust and content of the suite of guidelines. As a follow up, an information note in relation to clarification of areas for biodiversity enhancement and the method of recording these is being prepared for issue across the sector. I will insist on uniform application of these procedures. Compliance with these guidelines is a condition of grant aid and is monitored by the Forest Service. It is worth noting that virtually all forestry planting in Ireland is grant aided under the afforestation grants and premium scheme and all payments under the scheme are contingent on compliance with the guidelines. Monitoring will be by means of site <Col N="1283" /> inspections by the Forest Service inspectorate of my Department.</P>
    <P>The issue of further afforestation in areas with poorly buffered soils is being addressed under new afforestation management and environmental procedures which are applicable from 1 October. These new procedures, including the issue of afforestation on poorly buffered soils, were the subject of an information day for all stakeholders in August last. Following consultations with the EPA and COFORD, a protocol on afforestation on poorly buffered soils is being developed and should be agreed shortly.</P>

      <P>On 3 October, I received a briefing from the US ambassador to Ireland on the investigation into the terrorist attacks of 11 September in the US. The ambassador disclosed to me certain information, gathered from intelligence and other sources, which appeared to link directly a number of the suspected attackers to the al-Qaeda group and Osama bin Laden. I am not in a position to say whether the information disclosed to me was similar to information disclosed to other states on a bilateral basis, although it was broadly the same as that outlined to representatives of EU member states in a briefing given that afternoon in Brussels. The Deputy will appreciate that, for obvious security reasons, I cannot go into detail as to the information I received.</P>

In addition, I have written to the Colombian foreign minister to ask him to request the competent authorities to expedite the case to the greatest degree possible.

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's involvement in Euratom stems from our membership of the European Union. Euratom was established in 1957 by one of the treaties of Rome. When Ireland joined the European Economic Community, as it then was, this country also acceded to the Euratom Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of successive Irish Governments has long been firmly opposed to nuclear energy because of the safety and environmental risks it poses. The Government's nuclear policy places a heavy emphasis on nuclear safety and on radiological protection. While recognising that certain European countries, including Britain, have <Col N="1285" /> retained nuclear energy as an option for power generation, and while one of the tasks of Eura-</P>
    <P>tom is to promote the establishment and growth of nuclear industries in the Community, Ireland has remained vehemently opposed to nuclear energy. I do not accept that Ireland's membership of Euratom is contrary to the Government's position regarding Sellafield. The Government's concerns about Sellafield have informed Ireland's priorities within Euratom, which have been to steer the Euratom programme of activities towards nuclear safety and radiological protection, and the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty and protocols. Euratom has been active in both of these areas. The Euratom treaty encompasses, in Chapter III, some important provisions in the area of health and safety. For example, Article 30 provides for basic safety standards, which must be laid down within the community for the protection of the health of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionising radiation. This article led to the Euratom Directive 96/29, major legislation that sets out new revised standards of safety in this field, and was in turn transposed into Irish law by S.I. 125 of 2000, the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000.</P>
    <P>Euratom is a contracting party to the 1998 additional protocol to the 1977 agreement on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons between the non-nuclear weapons states of Euratom, including Ireland, Euratom itself and the International Atomic Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>Another example of the work of Euratom is a recent report, Nuclear Safety in the Context of Enlargement, produced in June 2001 by a Euratom working party which sought to define the objective of a high level of nuclear safety in the candidate countries wishing to accede to the EU. Ireland took an active part in the deliberations leading to this report. The Euratom treaty contains other provisions, for example, relating to the disposal of radioactive waste and nuclear safeguards, which are designed to give assurance that nuclear plants within the Community are operated to the highest possible standards of safety and security. The Government will continue to work through the various Euratom groups to ensure, in as far as the treaty allows, that Euratom's focus is on nuclear safety rather than nuclear promotion.</P>

      <P>Since 1999, Dublin Bus has acquired a total of 375 new buses, 275 of which are additional to the existing fleet. These buses have increased capacity on existing routes and increased frequency of services in peak hours. In 2001 Bus Átha Cliath, as part of its renewal and expansion programme under the national development plan, placed an order for the delivery of a further 56 new buses. To date, 12 of the buses have been delivered with the balance of 44 due over the coming weeks. I understand from Bus Átha Cliath that these new buses will be used to withdraw older buses from the fleet.</P>

      <P>The policy at EU level on the co-ordinated introduction of a third generation mobile and wireless communications in the Union was determined by a European Parliament and Council Decision of 14 December 1999, Decision No. 128/1999/EC. This decision requires that member states take all actions necessary in order to allow, in accordance with the EU licensing directive, the co-ordinated and progressive introduction of 3G services in their territory by 1 January 2002. The responsibility for imple-</P>
      <P>menting the requirements of the decision rests with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. This is subject to any public service requirements for licensing spectrum that I may specify in accordance with section 4(9) of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, and to my consent to regulations under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts to establish the licensing of the spectrum to be used for 3G. I have not specified any public service requirements under section 4(9) of the 1996 Act and have not yet received any proposed regulations from the director for my consent.</P>
      <P>The determination of the appropriate number of service providers to licence for provision of 3G services and the award of licences is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. Following a public consultation, and analysis of the market and spectrum availability, the director decided to license four service providers and has outlined the licensing framework to be employed. The setting of licence fees is a matter for the ODTR and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for £300,000, all for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million. Following the usual contract negotiations, contracts of sale were forwarded to the purchasers solicitors in July last for completion. The return of the completed contract by Naas UDC is expected in the next two to three weeks. The legal formalities will be completed shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>Security costs to date amount to £316,636. Savings in relation to the costs of military security at the barracks are estimated at approximately £381,600 in addition to savings on maintenance, electricity, water and telephone charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the premium system in the cattle sector continues to <Col N="1290" /> favour extensive grass based beef production over intensive production. While the special beef premium for bulls was increased by a slightly greater percentage than that for steers in the context of the Agenda 2000 agreement, the total premium on steers, taking the two instalments together, is significantly higher than the single premium for young bulls. In addition, the majority of steers in Ireland are also eligible for the extensification premium at £52 per head where the stocking density it below 1.6 livestock units per hectare. Furthermore, under Agenda 2000, land under maize silage was excluded from the calculation of stocking density for the purposes of the extensification premium in order to ensure that intensive producers did not qualify for this premium. Grass based production is also encouraged through the REPS.</P>
      <P>Apart from the rates of payment, the stocking density limit on premium payments also favours extensive over intensive production. The recent decision by the European Union to reduce this limit from two livestock units per hectare at present to 1.8 livestock units per hectare in 2003 will impact much more severely on intensive producers of young bull beef than on grass based production. I will maintain the approach that EU policy continues to favour grass based beef production.</P>

      <P>Irish beef is predominantly produced from grass fed cattle, reared in an unpolluted environment and in animal welfare friendly conditions. Allied to this Ireland's BSE <Col N="1291" /> controls are among the strictest in the world, having been significantly enhanced in 1996 and 1997. The level and effectiveness of these controls has been recognised by the European Union's scientific steering committee's geographically based risk assessment which classified Ireland as very stable in 1997 and optimally stable &ndash; the highest level of stability that is achievable &ndash; since 1998. Optimally stable means that all three main stability factors &ndash; feeding, rendering and SRM removal &ndash; are in place, well controlled, implemented and audited. Very few countries have achieved this high level of stability.</P>
      <P>These factors are generally reflected in the range of international markets traditionally supplied by exporters of Irish beef. Following the BSE crisis in Europe late last year, a number of third countries took action to ban the import of European beef in general. The recent decision by the Egyptian authorities in relation to the beef trade indicates the acceptability of the Irish approach to controls in the sector and I am hopeful that other countries will soon follow suit.</P>

      <P>I announced to the House in March this year my intention to introduce a comprehensive system of identification and traceability for the national sheep flock. The first elements of the new system were in place within two months, with flock owners able to order and receive tags from approved suppliers. The national sheep identification system &ndash; NSIS &ndash; as a whole went &ldquo;live&rdquo; on 21 June. This means that, for the first time, Ireland has full traceability of all sheep, on an individual animal basis. Every sheep which moves from a holding within the State or which is imported into the State and every sheep carcass processed in any of our processing plants is now fully and individually identified. All sheep remaining on holdings are required to be individually tagged by 15 December next. I attach great importance to this development which is of significant benefit to the sheep sector, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheep meat forum. I believe that many flock owners are already beginning to appreciate the benefits of individual tagging for flock management purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is monitoring the implementation of NSIS on an ongoing basis and I am pleased to report that the system is working well and that sheep presented in marts and factories are properly tagged and documented. I look for<Col N="1292" /> ward to full compliance by flock owners with the requirement that all sheep remaining on holdings are tagged no later than 15 December next. To date more than eight million tags have been issued by approved suppliers to more than 40,000 flock owners. I have already said that while I regard the introduction of NSIS as a major achievement, I regard it as a system which can be built upon and which can evolve in line with technological advances and the requirements of the sector as a whole.</P>

      <P>The influence of the CAP on the Irish farming community can be most easily measured in terms of transfers from the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund to support incomes and assist development of farming structures. These have increased from £37 million in 1973 to £1,352 million in 2000. In the annual review and outlook, published by my Department, the overall net impact of the CAP is measured in terms of both a net budget effect, that is, EU receipts less Ireland's contribution to the CAP budget, and the trade benefits that result from Irish companies selling to EU markets where prices are higher than those on non-EU markets. These two figures are calculated to have yielded a combined benefit of £1.44 billion in 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the classification of land is concerned the position is that when the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance schemes were first introduced in Ireland in 1975 the disadvantaged status of all land in the country had to be determined. In general land was classified as non-disadvantaged, less severely handicapped and more severely handicapped. The criteria concerning the designation of areas as disadvantaged are set out in EEC Directive 85/350. These criteria relate to (1) Infertile land: (a) less than 7.8% of area must be ploughed, (b) less than one livestock unit per forage hectare; (2) farm income: (a) family farm income per male farm worker must not exceed 80% of national average; (3) population: (a) not greater than 27 inhabitants per square kilometre, (b) minimum of 30% of working population engaged in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of reviews of disadvantaged areas have since been carried, out most recently in 1996, resulting in some 75% of land in Ireland now being classified as disadvantaged. Some 59% of land is classified as more severely handicapped while the remaining 16% is classified as less severely handicapped. When the sheep headage element of the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance schemes was being introduced it was decided that certain sheep farmers who had mountain breeding ewes which were substantially maintained on mountain type grazings should be paid headage grants on such ewes. Mountain breeding ewes were defined as Blackface Moun<Col N="1294" /> tain &ndash; horny &ndash; and Cheviot, and first crosses between or on these breeds. No sheep headage grants were payable to farmers who maintained other breeding ewes. However, headage grants were also paid on hogget ewes maintained on mountain and lowland grazings.</P>
    <P>When the land parcel identification system was introduced in 1996 it became necessary to identify all land areas which were traditionally treated as mountain type grazings for sheep headage purposes in order that sheep headage grants could continue to be paid to those farmers who maintained mountain breeding ewes. In designating such areas on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place. However the designation of mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain breeding ewes.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulty which mountain classification causes for some farmers under the new area based compensatory allowance scheme and I have carried out a review of the scheme with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land. In this connection I have recently made a formal submission to the European Commission seeking approval for a revision of the scheme. I should point out however that many farmers with mountain type land particularly those with sheep only or those who, because of their farming enterprise, were limited to payment on 30 livestock units under the old animal based system, are in fact gaining substantially under the new scheme.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The new area based compensatory allowance <Col N="1295" /> scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped, lowland, £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; Less severely handicapped, lowland, £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; Mountain type land, £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>The person named was paid £1,971.06 on 24 September 2001 in respect of 43.8 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. This compares with his average headage payment of £1,157.67 over the years 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
    <P>Following a thorough review of the area based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

      <P>Depopulation of a herd due to brucellosis is considered where there is active infection in the herd and where veterinary opinion is that the herd cannot be saved by ongoing testing and is a serious risk to contiguous herds and to human health. Depopulations are only effected with the agreement of the herd-owners concerned. A herdowner whose herd is depopulated, totally or partially, may qualify for compensation payment by way of reactor grant or net differential valuation amount plus a depopulation grant for each animal removed as a reactor. The conditions attaching to payment and the payment arrangements which include special provisions in relation to pedigree animals are detailed in the documentation given to the herdowner at the time of the disease breakdown. The herdowner also receives payment of salvage price by the factory.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, <Col N="1300" /> in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: More severely handicapped &ndash; lowland, £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; Less severely handicapped &ndash; lowland, £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; Mountain type land, £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid £816.30 on 25 September 2001, in respect of 18.14 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare, together with an additional sum of £121.41 under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission for farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The additional sum is equal to 90% of the difference between the average sum of the headage payments, in this case under the 1998, 1999 and 2000 headage schemes and the amount paid under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first 10 hectares of mountain type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an agri-environmental plan in September 1999 showing just over 25 hectares as eligible for payment under the scheme. The area consisted of 21.01 hectares of commonage and 4.08 hectares of owned land and he was paid accordingly. The applicant has now submitted an agri-environmental plan in which he has declared the commonage as ineligible for payment in section 5 of the plan. This reduction in eligible area &ndash; as advised to my Department by the applicant &ndash; may mean that there has been an overpayment and it will result in reduced payments in future. The question of an overpayment is being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>I totally reject the <Col N="1302" /> assertion that consultants, farmers and local office staff are given no guidance, assistance, flexibility or discretion in the day-to-day operation of new farm schemes. Whenever major new schemes are being launched, my Department takes steps to provide information and advice for farmers, their professional advisers and staff in the Department's local offices so as to ensure that the schemes will operate smoothly. Depending on what is needed, the steps taken include published help-sheets and guidelines, information meetings for farmers, training sessions and seminars for agricultural consultants and training for departmental staff. When application forms, scheme documents and help-sheets are being drafted, the farming organisations are consulted to ensure that the documents are as simple and easily understood as possible. Staff in local offices get comprehensive instructions on the operation of those schemes in which they are involved. Regular briefing sessions are held to sort out any problems and monitor progress in processing applications. Departmental staff have flexibility and discretion in the operation of schemes, but they must at all times work within the terms of the schemes and of the EU regulations under which most of the Department's schemes are operated.</P>
      <P>Farmers applying for REPS have to engage the services of planners, who may either be employed by Teagasc or be in private practice. All such planners are approved and trained by my Department. The conditions and specifications of the new REP scheme were circulated to all approved planning agencies, and my Department arranged a series of introductory seminars for planners to coincide with the launch of the scheme at the end of November 2000. Virtually all REPS planners attended. Training courses for suitably qualified individuals wishing to establish their own planning agencies are also organised and presented by my Department. One such course was run in June last and another is planned for the end of this month. These seminars and courses are provided free of charge by my Department. My Department is currently engaged in a series of meetings with Teagasc and private planners to review the operation of the new REP scheme and identify issues on which planners may require further guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>REPS participants or prospective applicants for the scheme are provided with training courses. These courses are delivered by planning agencies, both Teagasc and private firms, in accordance with a syllabus prepared by my Department. The Department approves all courses, contributes to their cost and monitors their content to ensure participants get tuition of an appropriately high quality. Applications under the early retirement scheme are prepared by professional agricultural consultants and advisers. Since the introduction of the scheme in November 2000, a number of regional information seminars have taken place to which all advisers were invited. In addition, both professional and administrative staff in my Department have been given training through <Col N="1303" /> seminars, information sessions and on-the-job training. My officials have also met Teagasc and private agricultural consultants, as well as the farmer organisations, to discuss issues relating to the operation of the scheme. Local office administrative staff are not involved in the operation of the new early retirement scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not reject any application gratuitously. When the payment targets under the protocol on direct payments to farmers were being negotiated with the farming organisations, my Department emphasised that the onus lay on applicants to submit applications that conformed with the requirements of the various schemes and that the targets could apply only to valid applications. Under REPS and the early retirement scheme, an applicant is required to provide land parcel identification numbers and areas, or where such numbers are not available to provide evidence that they have been applied for. Cross-checking of land areas in area-based schemes is a requirement of EU regulations and the LPIS is the means by which this must be done. Where such information is not submitted my Department has no option but to return the application.</P>
      <P>In the early retirement scheme, my Department has to obtain a substantial amount of information so that it can establish the eligibility of both the transferor and the transferee. The information required relates &ndash; among other things &ndash; to age, income and farming experience. The application is a composite one and must be completed and signed by both parties. There is no intention to disclose information about a transferee to a transferor, as I would expect that a farmer intending to retire under the scheme would already have ascertained that his or her intending transferee meets all the conditions for eligibility.</P>
      <P>Some 2,500 applications have been received under the schemes of investment aid for farm waste management and for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards in the local farm development services office. The processing of applications has suffered serious delays arising out of the foot and mouth crisis. Just over 50% of these applications have been examined. Some 25% had deficiencies in the documentation and were returned to applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for all schemes are processed in accordance with standard procedures. These procedures are considered to be the minimum neces<Col N="1304" /> sary to ensure that applicants comply fully with the terms and conditions of the schemes and that my Department complies with its obligations as a paying agency of the EU. Applications for REPS, the early retirement scheme and the on-farm investment schemes require the input of agricultural consultants or other professional advisers, and this should minimise the risk of defective applications being submitted.</P>

    <P>These grants cover organisations active in 21 counties and an asterisk denotes those which deal specifically with cats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> As indicated a grant of £7,500 was paid to The Cat Protection Society of Ireland in respect of 2000. As the payment of such aid is invariably an end-of-year exercise depending on the resources available out of my Department's Vote any disbursements are entirely contingent on funds being available at year-end for this purpose. I will consider requests for aid in respect of this year from cat protection organisations in the light of any resources that may become available and having regard to any competing claims for grant assistance which may be submitted by other welfare bodies, many of which deal with various categories of animals, including cats. A formal statutory framework for cat control is already provided for under the Control of Dogs Act, 1986 which is administered by the Department for the Environment and Local Government. That Act provides for the introduction of regulations in relation to cats.</P>

      <P>The specific proposal referred to forms one part of a package of proposals recently brought forward by the European Commission in the context of a major reform of the EU legislation regulating both the human and veterinary medicines fields. This package of proposals falls to be dealt with under the co-decision procedure involving both the European Parliament and the European Council. As such, best estimates indicate that it will be at least two years before final decisions on the Commission's proposals will be taken by Parliament and the Council.</P>
      <P>At this early stage, the Commission's proposals have not been discussed in detail. In the context of such discussions, our approach in the first instance will be to obtain clarification from the Commission on its proposal to make all medicines for food producing animals subject to veterinary prescription, given that currently there is an absence of harmonisation at EU level as regards the operation of prescription regimes. Having obtained such clarification, my Department will be in a better position to assess the full implications of the proposals for Ireland. Ireland has already, prior to the emergence of these proposals, asked the Commission to address the harmonisation issue in order to improve regulation of the EU veterinary medicines market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that at this early stage in the EU decision-making pro<Col N="1307" /> cess, it would not be appropriate for me to take an absolute position on one aspect of the Commission's package of proposals affecting the veterinary sector. Without prejudice to the position which I may adopt on the various detailed elements, I can empathise with the overall stated objectives of the European Commission, which are fundamentally about enhancing the protection of European consumers and which also fully recognise the importance in this context of ensuring the availability of veterinary treatments. My Department will approach the detailed discussions with a view to ensuring that the EU legislative framework resulting from the reform meets these objectives. In this regard, the Deputy can be assured that the views of all stakeholders, including those of the person to whom he has referred, will be fully taken into account.</P>

      <P>Closed seasons are normally a requirement for hunted species whose numbers would otherwise be endangered. The only regions in Ireland where badger numbers have been significantly reduced are those comprising the four area project &ndash; part of counties Donegal, Monaghan, Cork and Kilkenny &ndash; and in east Offaly. While my Department's research suggested that there was no need for a closed season in the light of the reduction in badger numbers, nevertheless, in consultation with Dúchas, it was decided to introduce a three month close season &ndash; June to August &ndash; in the four area project and this is a condition of the licence. I have no proposals to extend these arrangements. The main strategic focus of my Department's current research programme relates to the assessment of the disease contribution of the badger to bovine disease levels and the development of a vaccine for badgers which should obviate the need for their removal in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The significance of the role of the badger in the spread of bovine tuberculosis is accepted by veterinary scientists who have examined the evidence in detail. They now generally accept that the reservoir of infec<Col N="1308" /> tion in the badger population is a major constraint to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in cattle.</P>
      <P>My Department has in the past evaluated various methods for capturing badgers. The method currently used is considered to be the most humane method available. Though commonly referred to as a snare, this is technically incorrect as the device is designed specifically to restrain rather than to squeeze on the target animal. The stop on the loop prevents tightening and there is also a runner on the loop which prevents loosening and subsequent escape of the restrained badger.</P>
      <P>To date there are no reports to give rise to concern about the use of these devices. I am conscious of the welfare aspect and alternative methods of capture, including cages and leg cuffs, have been examined but not adopted as no welfare advantage has been found with any of these methods.</P>

I have, however, recently decided to accept the central thrust of a report from the Irish Medicines Board to the effect that intramammary antibiotic medicines should be brought under prescription control. My Department will now consider in detail the implications of this decision in terms of existing legislation. In this context, all stakeholders will be afforded an opportunity to put forward their views and suggestions on the operation of a prescription control regime in relation to intramammaries, while retaining the essential elements of a prescription control regime. My Department is currently in the process of writing to interested parties in this regard.  </P>

      <P>Measures have been introduced in this jurisdiction since 21 February last to prevent the spread of the disease from Britain where to date there have been 2,030 cases of the disease and more than 3.9 million animals have been slaughtered.</P>
      <P>There may be increasing grounds for a degree of optimism in the fact that the most recent confirmed case of FMD in Britain was on 30 September last. Given that we know that FMD can re-emerge in areas which have apparently been cleared of the disease, it is too early to conclude that we have seen the last case of FMD in Britain. We must therefore maintain both our sense of vigilance and the controls and precautionary measures which have played a critical role in our success to date in combating the FMD threat.</P>
      <P>While the range of measures introduced since 21 February has been adjusted on an ongoing basis, a number continue to apply in the interests of safeguarding animal health. The main additional measures still applicable are the following: bans remain on imports of susceptible animals and certain products from Great Britain; imports from Northern Ireland of pigs and sheep are subject to full compliance with EU trading rules; controls continue to apply at ports-airports with mobile patrols at the Border; with some exemptions, animals purchased must be retained by buyers for 30 days; farm to farm movements of cattle must be notified in advance to SWS; various events involving animals are permitted under specific protocols agreed between the Department and organisers; sheep shearing and AI are regulated.</P>
      <P>Apart from these measures, I have continued to emphasise the need for retention of effective bio security and disinfection measures at farms, marts and agricultural premises. I would take this opportunity to again urge all farmers and those in charge of agricultural related premises and events to maintain all the required precautions.</P>

      <P>My colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is responsible for the administration of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species &ndash; CITES. While internationally there is a significant trade in endangered species, there is only a small trade in such species into Ireland. This is borne out by the total number of certificates and permits issued by the national parks and wildlife division of Dúchas in 2000 &ndash; 42 such permits in total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The import of live animals, including exotic, as opposed to endangered species, to this country from other EU member states is governed by a number of EU directives, which establish the animal health conditions for such trade. Any such animals imported into Ireland must comply with the terms of these directives and, where appropriate, must be accompanied by the health certificate laid down in the relevant directive certifying freedom from stated diseases. Such trade is limited in the main to zoos, wildlife parks and pet shops. Imports by individuals are rare, are usually due to a change of residence and must in any <Col N="1317" /> event comply with the health certificate requirements laid down in the Council directives.</P>
    <P>In relation to the import of such species from third countries, bilateral rules apply. In all instances these are as a minimum to the health rules which apply to intracommunity trade in such species.</P>

A feature of the 2001 harvest was a considerable drop in winter wheat sowings up to the end of December, due to particularly wet weather during the latter part of 2000. This resulted in some 25% of winter wheat being sown early in the new year.</P>

      <P>Products of animal origin imported from other member states and from third countries must comply with certain standards of production as provided for under EU legislation in order to protect animal and public health. Before any such trading is permitted consideration is given by the Commission to a number of factors which are: the health status of the livestock, both domestic and wild, especially in regard to exotic diseases; the swiftness of the country to report the existence of infectious diseases; the country's preventative controls for animal diseases; the structure of the veterinary service and laboratory service; and the country's control measures on prohibited substances.</P>
      <P>In relation to countries with particular incidences of animal diseases, such as BSE and foot and mouth disease, additional measures are taken by requiring specific veterinary certification in relation to the product with regard to its production and processing procedures.

      <P>The most recent assessment of the situation of the pigmeat sector and its relative competitive position was carried out as part of the strategic study of the pigmeat industry in Ireland. This study was jointly commissioned by me and Minister Bríd Rodgers and involved the development agencies on both sides of the Border. The purpose of the exercise was to assess the current state of the industry on the island of Ireland, to consider the future outlook for the industry and to ascertain the main steps that need to be taken to ensure future competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The report identifies rationalisation of slaughter capacity, scaling-up of plant size and better capacity utilisation as necessary prerequisites to positioning the industry to compete on both the national and international markets. Other recommendations are also made in regard to improving the reliability and consistency of supply to the secondary processing and catering sectors, development of the value added sector and promotion of supply chain agreements.</P>
      <P>While most of the findings of the study are very much matters within the control of the industry, Enterprise Ireland has been discussing the report findings with the industry over recent months and Enterprise Ireland and my Department will continue to progress the issues raised.</P>
      <P>While international competition will continue to increase, I believe the Irish pig industry can make the necessary adjustments to ensure its future viability and prosperity.</P>
      <P>The pig sector is doing well at present. Producer prices are about 18% higher than the price levels of 2000, and it is expected that there will be market stability over the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 249 together.</P>
      <P>Beef and lamb exports for the first six months of 2001, the most recent period for which statistics are available, amounted to 123,000 and 27,000 tonnes respectively. These figures compared with 273,000 and 25,000 tonnes for the same period in 2000.</P>
      <P>Clearly beef exports have been adversely affected by the drop in beef consumption within the EU and the loss of third country markets arising from the BSE crisis in mainland Europe late last year. Every effort at political, diplomatic and technical level has been taken to secure the reopening of these important third country markets. My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia has worked intensively to point out to the authorities in those markets the level and effectiveness of the controls in place in Ireland and to emphasise the guarantees in relation to food safety we can offer to consumers of Irish beef. As the Deputy will be aware, this strategy has had a most recent success in Egypt where the controls in place in Ireland have been acknowledged as being acceptable to their experts and I am hopeful that other markets will follow suit.</P>
      <P>France is by far our major market for sheepmeat and the returns from that market have been extremely satisfactory this year. Third country trade in sheepmeat does not feature due to the fact that the EU is deficit in the product and the export refund mechanism does not apply.</P>
      <P>As regards the competitiveness of Irish meat exports, I am satisfied that within the context referred to of reduced beef consumption within the EU and import bans on European beef by certain third countries, Ireland is nevertheless performing very well. Beef exports to the UK, for example, are considerably above last year's level and the prognosis for the year as a whole is for this to continue. The Russian market is also performing substantially better in the latter half of this year than in the same period last year. Overall, the trend in the beef sector is positive as consumption recovers from the low levels seen in the wake of the BSE crisis last year.</P>
      <P>The performance of the sheepmeat sector is extremely positive this year, a factor which is linked to the absence of the UK from the French market.</P>

      <P>The development of the sport horse industry is primarily the responsibility of the Irish Horse Board, which has, since its formation in 1993, been implementing a development plan for the sport horse sector. In co-operation with the board, my Department has provided a wide range of horse breeding improvement grants under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-1999 and, more recently, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which have focused on quality to encourage farmers to breed marketable sport horses and other non-thoroughbred horses. Funds have also been provided for the marketing and promotion of such horses.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Equestrian Federation of Ireland has appointed a task force to make recommendations in relation to the establishment of a strategic plan for the development of the non-thoroughbred horse sector and I await their findings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has always enjoyed a high animal health status and various arrangements are in place to control and eradicate animal diseases that exist here. With the confirmation of a single case of foot and mouth dis<Col N="1321" /> ease in Proleek in County Louth on 22 March, however, Ireland lost its FMD free status and a number of restrictions were imposed in relation to the export of Irish livestock and of certain</P>
      <P>animal-based products.</P>
      <P>As a result of the immediate action taken by my Department and in particular the strategic slaughter of susceptible animals in the region surrounding the infected premises, the EU Commission lifted its restrictions on Ireland at the end of April, 2001. This meant that Ireland was again free to trade in EU markets at that time.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, on 19 September 2001, I announced that the World Organisation for Animal Health &ndash; OIE &ndash; had restored Ireland's FMD free status. The OIE decision reflected satisfaction on the part of the OIE that the measures undertaken by the Irish authorities following the confirmation of a single case of foot and mouth disease had been effective. Such measures included extensive serological assessment of the national sheep flock, which entailed the testing of 160,000 individual samples.</P>
      <P>This outcome is the product of the efforts of all sections of the community over a period of many months to ensure that we rid the country once again of FMD and that we prevent the disease being re-imported. The major impact of the OIE decision is to entirely remove the basis for any restrictions on the trade of animals and animal products from Ireland which were imposed by other countries as a result of the FMD case here.</P>
      <P>Finally, there remains a market difficulty in relation to the sale of beef arising from concerns about BSE in Europe generally. This is not a problem specific to Ireland where there is a low incidence of the disease, and indeed the product of the stringent controls adopted in Ireland in 1996 is that while the number of BSE cases has risen this year, no animals born after 1996 have yet been identified with the disease. This contrasts with the experience in a number of other member states where stringent feed controls were introduced only in 1999, and where younger animals have been identified with the disease.</P>
      <P>The effectiveness of the Irish controls now appears to have been accepted in our main beef markets, and I am satisfied that these controls provide a sound basis for confidence in Irish beef.</P>

      <P>It is policy to compensate herdowners for the value of their herd or animals as soon as possible after BSE has been diagnosed on completion of processing of documentation etcetera.

      <P>On some occasions, delays can occur due to difficulties with valuations while there may be cases where doubts exist as to the identification or origin of the infected animal, of other animals in the herd, or in relation to other factors which may have given rise to the disease. It is the policy of my Department to investigate such issues prior to payment to ensure that there is no question of culpability on the part of the herdowner in relation to the introduction of the disease into the herd. Such investigations give rise to delays in payment in a very small minority of cases.</P>

In addition, some animals were slaughtered in other parts of the country as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>Some 280 flocks and herds were depopulated on the Cooley Peninsula in the course of the cull along with 24 flocks-herds in the rest of the country. More than 50,000 sheep were culled during the foot and mouth crisis together with 1,880 other susceptible species. A total in excess of £7.3 million has been issued in compensation to herdowners in respect of these flocks.

      <P>A great deal of research has been carried out in the United Kingdom in relation to the cause of BSE. The overwhelming weight of evidence is that the disease is caused by the feeding of concentrate feed contaminated with the infective agent. In Ireland ongoing epidemiological investigation in respect of each case of BSE case identified supports the conclusions of the UK research.</P>

      <P>Under the EU purchase for destruction &ndash; PFD &ndash; scheme which ended on 30 June last, 278,025 animals were slaughtered at a total cost to date of approximately £198 million. This amount includes purchasing costs of £160 million and expenditure on operating costs, to date, of £38 million. A sum of £77.8 million has already been claimed from the EU under the terms of the co-financing arrangements laid down in the EU regulation governing the scheme. The balance of the EU contribution <Col N="1324" /> will be received when the meat and bone meal produced under the scheme is destroyed.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the new early retirement scheme in November 2000, 575 farmers have applied to join the scheme. Of these, 371 have been approved for payment and 142 applications are currently being processed. Of the remainder, 11 have been definitively found to be ineligible and two cases are under appeal. The rest have been returned as defective, but if the deficiencies are rectified there is the possibility that they can be successfully re-submitted.</P>

No area aid application was received from the person named for the year 2000, and consequently no cattle headage payments can be made for the year in question.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers relates to a paper published in the Journal of Veterinary and Human Toxicology in 1998. This paper described the post mortem findings in six horses submitted to the Equine Centre from a farm in Askeaton, Co. Limerick between December 1995 and July 1997. The authors of the paper claimed that lesions were due to aluminium toxicity and that the uptake of the latter had been facilitated by acid rain in the area.</P>
      <P>The claims raised were discussed at a meeting in 1998 between the authors of the paper, representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and the other agencies. At that meeting it was pointed out by Environmental Protection Agency representatives that intensive environmental monitoring had shown no evidence that the region has been subject either to acid rain or aluminium pollution.</P>
      <P>My Department, in the Journal of Veterinary and Human Toxicology in 1999, gave a detailed response to the claims in the paper. This response highlighted the lack of credible evidence presented by the authors in support of their claims regarding aluminium involvement and suggested that many of the lesions described could be attributed to the effects of parasitism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, officials of my Department offered to meet with the authors in 1998 and 1999 <Col N="1327" /> to discuss this issue in further detail but to date, the authors have been unavailable for a meeting.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will know, it is the established practice that a Minister for Finance does not answer a Parliamentary Question about the tax or PRSI affairs of an individual or a company, other than when the Deputy asking the question was acting on behalf of the company concerned. As this does not appear to be the case in the present instance I regret that I must accept the advice of the Revenue Commissioners that the information should not be divulged on grounds of confidentiality.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Revenue Commissioners, however, that they take all appropriate action in individual cases to recover sums owed to the State.</P>
      <P>While not commenting on the particular case, I can assure the Deputy that under the relevant social welfare legislation the obligation to deduct and account for PRSI contributions is that of the employer. Where evidence is available that the employer did deduct PRSI &ndash; e.g. on the employer's P35 return, or the employee's form P45 or P60 &ndash; the employee will be given credit for the contributions in determining his or her entitlement to social welfare benefits notwithstanding that the contributions are not paid over to the State in whole or in part or are paid late.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the existing position in relation to business relief in respect of CAT on the transfer of family businesses involved in the operation of caravan parks is as set out below.</P>
      <P>The availability of relief depends on the particular facts in each case. Each case is approached by reference to the type of letting activity involved, i.e. how much of the letting relates to furnished caravans owned by the business and how much to pitch sites, that is a site for a caravan. As a general guideline, where a business's own furnished caravans account for at least half the total number of lettings the business will be accepted as primarily trading and therefore eligible for business relief, irrespective of the facilities provided. Conversely, where most of the lettings relate to pitch sites and facilities are restricted to the provision of electricity, water, toilets and a shop, business relief will be denied on the grounds that the business was mainly engaged in the exploitation of its property rights as opposed to carrying on a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> I have no plans to change the legislation in this area at present but I shall keep the matter under review in the context of the 2002 Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's return of income was received by the inspector of taxes on 26 July 2001. A notice of assessment was issued to the taxpayer on 8 August 2001 showing a refund due of £1,252.47 (1,590.31).</P>
      <P>The notice of assessment was issued during the peak processing season. Owing to pressure of work, repayments were delayed during this period as the processing of returns was treated as a priority. A new Revenue computer system was introduced in September 2001 to streamline the refund process. The taxpayer's refund was entered through this system on 27 September 2001 but, due to a technical difficulty with the new system, the repayment cheque was not issued. The difficulty has now been rectified and the taxpayer's refund will be issued within the next ten days.</P>
      <P>The inspector of taxes is writing to the taxpayer to outline the sequence of events and to apologise for the delay in issuing the refund.</P>

    <P>*This figure is provisional and subject to revision.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>It should be noted that some of the figures of income and tax included in the table for years up to 5 April 1988 were estimates subject to revision and are upwardly distorting the average rates of tax.</P>
    <P>The recent upward trend in the table may have been due to an increasing proportion of income tax becoming liable to tax at the top rate. Notwithstanding this, the income tax concessions announced in budgets 2000 and 2001 have had the effect of reducing the tax burden with tax as a proportion of income projected to fall to 24.4% (tax year 2000-01) and 22.7% (short tax year 2001) respectively in the tax years affected by the changes.</P>
    <P>Total income is the total income of taxpayers from all sources as estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts. It is net of such items as capital allowances, allowable interest which is not subject to relief at the standard rate, losses, allowable expenses, retirement annuities and superannuation contributions.</P>

      <P>It is not entirely clear to what the Deputy is referring.</P>
      <P>Economic growth in Ireland has averaged almost 9% &ndash; GNP basis &ndash; since the mid 1990s. Most commentators had expected that Ireland's economic growth would slow from these high levels of growth to the economy's medium-term potential growth rate of 4.5%-5%. As a result of the poorer global economic environment and the terrorist attacks in the US, Ireland's economic performance in the short term will be weaker than previously forecast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy at this juncture must be geared towards ensuring that when the international economy recovers, Ireland is positioned to benefit fully from that recovery. Only then can we return to <Col N="1331" /> a strong growth path in line with our economy's medium-term growth potential.</P>
    <P>In particular, we must avoid any weakening of Irish competitiveness on the cost front, sustain investor and business confidence through continued prudent management of the public finances, prioritise public spending towards programmes which improve the long-term capacity of the economy to benefit from the eventual improved conditions and make further progress on structural and regulatory reform.</P>

      <P>In the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, I made significant changes to the stamp duty regime on transfers of residential property arising from the recommendations of the third Bacon report into the housing market. The Act introduced a three tiered stamp duty structure for first time buyers, owner occupiers other than first time buyers and investors. Many first time owner occupier buyers of second hand houses are now either exempt from stamp duty or pay at a reduced rate. However, owner occupiers, who are not first time buyers, also benefit generally from the revised stamp duty rates </P>
      <P>The Act introduced a flat 9% stamp duty rate on all categories of investors buying new or second hand residential property. In the light of developments in the housing market since last year, the Government decided to reduce the rate of stamp duty for investors in new property from this flat 9% and an amendment to this effect was introduced on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2001 which applies to conveyances made on and from 27 February 2001. However, the investor rate for second hand properties remains at 9%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the reasons for the change in investor rate of stamp duty for the purchase of new prop<Col N="1332" /> erty in the Finance Act, 2001, was that the imposition of the 9% flat rate on non-owner occupied residential properties had resulted in some negative impact on developers and potential investors. There was evidence that this could have had adverse consequences on the prospects for overall housing supply and particularly for apartment developments, because reduced investor demand makes apartment developments unviable. There was also evidence that applications were being made to local authorities for a change in planning permission from residential to commercial.</P>
    <P>The change to the stamp duty regime left the investor rate unchanged in the second hand market while reducing it for new property, thus providing a supply incentive in this area. Limiting the concession to new housing maintains the relative advantage of first time purchasers in the second hand market which accounts for two thirds of first time purchaser transactions.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that new house completions are up by 4.8% in the first eight months of this year compared with the same period last year. At the same time the estimated stamp duty yield from investors in respect of new housing was £7 million for the first nine months of this year &ndash; compared to £3 million for the whole of last year from investors and owner occupiers alike. These data represent good news for both new home owners and, by extension, the housebuilding sector.</P>
    <P>I have no plans, at present, to introduce any further changes to the stamp duty structure. However, the position will be kept under continuous review in the light of developments in the housing market.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on recent changes to tax relief on moneys covenanted to schools by parents; the reason the minimum amount allowable has been raised; if he has considered the implications of these changes for the funding of secondary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, I decided to look at the whole area of tax relief for donations. At that time there were 13 different reliefs for donations to various bodies with widely different qualifying conditions. Having considered the area carefully, I decided to simplify and rationalise the various tax reliefs for donations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you will be aware, in this year's Finance Act, I introduced a new scheme of tax relief on donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to certain organisations. This includes charities, first and second level schools and third level institutions including universities. The minimum donation that must be made in any one year to a qualifying body is £200 (250) and this is <Col N="1334" /> £148 (185) for the short tax year in 2001. From 1 January 2002, the minimum donation will be 250. There is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated and the tax relief is available at an individual's marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, in the case of covenants to second level schools, while there was no minimum amount, these donations could only be used for the teaching of the natural sciences. The new scheme has no such restriction.</P>
    <P>As part of this simplification process, most of the existing tax reliefs for donations, including covenants for the teaching of the natural sciences in schools were allowed to lapse.</P>
    <P>I would also make the point that during the passage of the Finance Bill this year through Dáil Éireann, I reduced the minimum contribution from £250 (315) to £200 (250). However, I will bear the Deputy's comments in mind in relation to the minimum donation during the preparations for this year's budget and Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 and 333 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health services in counties Cork and Kerry is a matter for the Southern Health Board. The Southern Health Board's strategy for the development of services for older people is detailed in the document entitled, Ageing with Confidence. My Department will continue to liaise with the Southern Health Board on progressing the board's development plan for services for older people within the context of the annual estimates process, the national development plan and the forthcoming health strategy. The new health strategy which is being prepared by my Department will encompass a number of specific areas for priority service development, including services for older people.</P>
      <P>The Government has significantly increased the levels of additional revenue funding provided for the development of services for older people, from an additional £10 million &ndash; 12.69 million &ndash; in 1997 to an additional £57.427 million &ndash; 72.91 million &ndash; in 2001, including nursing home subvention funding. My Department has allocated more than £13 million &ndash; 16.5 million &ndash; in additional funding to the Southern Health Board in 2001 for the further development of services which affect older people throughout Cork and Kerry. This additional funding includes more than £7 million &ndash; 8.88 million &ndash; for <i>inter alia</i> improvements to support services in the community, support to carers, day care centres and community hospitals, £5.299 million &ndash; 6.72 million &ndash; for home help pay, and almost £1 million &ndash; 1.26 million &ndash; to support clinical services in community hospitals. This funding is being used to progress the implementation of the board's Ageing with Confidence strategy in accordance with regional needs and national policy.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2001-2006 a total of £35.487 million &ndash; 45.05 million &ndash; indicative funding has been notified to the Southern Health Board for capital investment in the development of services for older people. It is a matter for the board to decide its priority developments within the national development plan.</P>

      <P>The pre-hospital emergency care council has developed proposals for the creation of an emergency medical technician advanced grade, EMT-A. The council has identified a core group of drugs to be used by EMT-As. These proposals <Col N="1337" /> will require clarification of the legal position in the administration of drugs by EMT-As in defined clinical circumstances. As a first step, the council has recommended a feasibility study to explore the clinical, operational and managerial issues arising from the introduction of such a service. The proposals are being examined by my Department and will be the subject of further discussion with the council in the near future.</P>

It is an important EU initiative which is supported by the IMB, IBTS and my Department. I assure the Deputy that resources necessary to implement the provisions of the directive will be made available.

      <P>Under paragraph 3.10.6 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a commitment was given that the health board chief executive officers would examine the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is to be placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review has been completed recently and I understand the chief executive officers will present a report of their findings to my Department shortly. The report will be considered as part of the existing examination of the issue of eligibility that is taking place in the context of the new health strategy being prepared in my Department.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of medical treatment to residents of County Monaghan rests with the North Eastern Health Board. Accordingly, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the position in this case and reply to the Deputy directly.</P>
      <P>The need for hospital treatment is usually determined by the patient's general practitioner, who also determines the point of referral for the patient based on his or her knowledge of the service which will best meet the patient's medical need. Equity of access geographically is one of the key principles underpinning health policy. This means patients should have access to a wide range of hospital services in reasonable proximity to their homes and, in the case of specialist services, such services should be provided in designated national or supra-regional centres, with equal access for patients, irrespective of their place of residence.</P>
      <P>I have recently given approval to the North Eastern Health Board to proceed to design team selection and appointment in respect of the development of facilities at the Monaghan General Hospital. The project will include the development of the special care unit, accident and emergency facilities and ward accommodation upgrading. Funding for these developments is being provided from the indicative funding for capital developments notified to the board under the national development plan and will be of the order of £5 million &ndash; 6.35 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are three maximum rates of subvention payable, £90 or 114.28, £120 or 152.39, £150 or 190.46, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum, which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>On the particular case raised by the Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Cork area is a matter for the Southern Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the case and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertook a survey of nursing vacancies on 31 July 2001. I am arranging for a copy of this survey to be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The survey contains a summary of the vacancy position in each health board area. It found that a total of 4,653 nurses were recruited in the year ending 31 July 2001 and that a total of 2,951 nurses resigned, retired or moved to another employer in the same period. Accordingly, the recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving with a net increase of 1,702 nurses in the system.</P>
      <P>The total number of nursing vacancies reported was 1,251. This is a decrease of 5% when compared with the previous survey. A total of 416.75 agency nurses were employed every day during the month of July 2001. Excluding three health boards for which figures were not available, it was reported that nationally a total of 2,895.05 hours overtime by nurses was used each day during the month of July 2001.

      <P>Between October 2000 and September 2001 19 cases of group C meningococcal disease have been notified in children under five years of age, compared to 66 cases in the same period the previous year, October 1999 to September 2000. This represents a 71% reduction in group C meningo-</P>
      <P>coccal disease in those under five years of age.</P>
      <P>Between October 2000 and September 2001, 33 cases of group C meningococcal disease have been notified in children under 18 years of age, 19 of which in children under 5 years and 14 in children in the five to 17 age group, compared to 131 cases in the same period the previous year. This represents a 75% reduction in group C meningococcal disease in those under 18 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since October 2000 there have been four deaths due to group C meningococcal disease, <Col N="1342" /> three of which were in the under 22 age group, compared to nine group C deaths in the same period the previous year. The four group C deaths that occurred in the past year were in individuals who had not been vaccinated.</P>
    <P>In the year since the meningococcal C vaccine was introduced in Ireland it has had a very positive impact in reducing both morbidity and mortality due to group C meningococcal disease. Overall, the incidence of the disease has been reduced by 72% in respect of the population as a whole compared to the previous year and the number of group C deaths has also been reduced.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months there has been a 7.9% reduction in the incidence of group B meningococcal disease. Between October 2000 and September 2001, 234 cases of group B disease have been notified compared to 254 cases in the same period the previous year.</P>

      <P>I am committed to the introduction of a system of State regulation for alternative and complementary therapists who work in the area of health and personal services. As a first step in this process, I convened a forum, which took place on Wednesday, 20 June 2001, comprised of relevant representative groups and training providers, to examine and explore the practical issues involved in preparing a system of registration for these therapists. The Institute of Public Administration, which facilitated the forum, prepared a report of the discussions that took place on the day. The report was forwarded to the participants and other interested parties for consideration. I subsequently asked the Institute of Public Administration to prepare a report on proposals for the way forward. On receipt of this report, which I hope to receive over the coming months, I hope to be in a position to progress the issue further.</P>
      <P>In regard to the possible inclusion of homeopathy under the general medical services, I presume the Deputy is referring to the inclusion of homeopathic products in the common list of items reimbursable under the community drug schemes. In order for this to occur, the products must comply with a list of criteria. These range from the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. The product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. In addition, the product should be an allopathic medicinal product and subject to a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board. Homeopathic products do not meet these criteria and, accordingly, are not eligible for inclusion on the common list.</P>

      <P>There is no specific legislative requirement that doctors keep themselves indemnified against the cost of claims for personal injury arising from the practice of medicine. All doctors working in the public health service are required to be indemnified against the cost of such claims. Doctors in private practice are independent contractors and it is a matter for themselves, or for the hospitals in which they practice, as to how they finance the cost of any successful claims made against them. A doctor who is unable to meet the cost of such claims and has neglected to ensure satisfactory indemnity cover could be considered to have behaved in an unethical and unprofessional manner. The issue of requiring doctors to produce evidence of holding satisfactory indemnity cover is being considered in the context of a new medical practitioners Act.</P>

Means are <Col N="1350" /> assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. I am advised by the board that the number of new applications for contract bed-enhanced subvention awaiting decision is 179 with a further 56 applications awaiting decision in relation to increased rates of enhanced subvention. The board estimates that the additional cost of meeting the claims would be £400,000, 507,895, in 2001 and £2.5 million, 3,174,345, in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact <Col N="1351" /> that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. A solution has been found to meet the most immediate individual problems and discussions are continuing in an effort to reach agreement on a more long-term approach to the issue.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that the process of drug procurement requiring the placing of advertisements is bypassed to the extent that a basic supply of iodine tablets is immediately acquired in the interests of national security; and if sufficient supplies of drugs and medications are widely available to meet potential problem with anthrax and other bio-chemicals.</Quest>

      <P>Only the most severe nuclear accidents will require the use of iodine tablets. Ingestion of iodine tablets may be effective in preventing thyroid cancer in certain populations, especially children exposed to radioactive fallout. I am advised that the Eastern Regional Health Authority has approximately 720,000 iodine tablets in stock at present which are still effective. The necessity of continued stocking of iodine tablets as part of the health input into the national nuclear emergency plan was reviewed as part of an update of the overall plan which is co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise. It was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I have accepted this recommendation and my Department is making the necessary arrangements as a matter of urgency for tendering and purchasing of new stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> The procedures laid down under Directive 93/36/EEC which allow for an accelerated tendering process with regard to the award of public supply contracts are being followed to purchase these stocks at the earliest possible opportunity. The European Commission has been notified of our invitation to tender for the supply of ten million iodide or iodate tablets. The deadline for submission of tenders is 13 November 2001. Furthermore, it is proposed to amend the relevant statutory instrument regarding the necessity for a product authorisation for this type of product to allow for quicker replacement of existing stocks.</P>
    <P>At my request a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, director of the Virus Reference Laboratory, was recently established to prepare an operational plan which would be implemented in the event of a biological attack on this country. The committee agreed that in preparing a plan it will be necessary to identify the level of risk of such an attack and that the plan should reflect the risk identified.</P>
    <P>The committee considered that as the risk of a primary attack on this country was low a plan should therefore be prepared to cater for a secondary attack. One of the targets identified by the committee as being central to developing a plan to deal with a secondary biological threat is to determine the availability of the necessary supplies of antibiotics and vaccines. The Irish Medicines Board has confirmed that sufficient quantities of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin have been secured to treat patients in the event of exposure to anthrax. The Irish Medicines Board has further confirmed that it has also secured 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccine which can be used in the event of a smallpox attack. In addition, other relevant antibiotics which may be necessary are available in adequate supply.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tÁrd Chláraitheoir &ndash; Registrar General &ndash; of Births and Deaths and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. The primary responsibility for the registration of births rests with the parents of the child.

      <P>The birth referred to by the Deputy has now been registered and a certified copy of the entry has been issued. An application was received for the late registration of the birth referred to by the Deputy on 7 September 2001. The brother of the person concerned, being a qualified informant in relation to the birth in question, has made the required statutory declaration and would also be required to attend at the office of the registrar to sign the entry. I understand that the person whose birth was to be registered rang the General Register Office on 3 October and it was explained that the necessary authority was ready to issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> However, I understand that the question of the availability of his brother to sign the entry in the register arose and he was told that in such circumstances he could apply in writing for the authority of An tÁrd Chláraitheoir for the registration to be effected under the provisions of section 3 of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1972. This would allow the registration of the birth to be completed without the attendance of the informant at the office of the registrar to sign the register. I understand that when no further correspondence was received by An tÁrd Chláraitheoir his authority issued on 8 October and the birth was duly registered on the signature of the register by the qualified informant. A copy of the entry was issued to the informant.</P>

The Government also decided that it would consider the proposed development of a consultant delivered public hospital service following quantification of the resource and cost implications involved.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department, in consultation with Mr. David Hanly, independent chairperson of the national task force on medical manpower, have been working on the draft terms of reference and working structures of the task force over the summer months, and I intend to proceed with the establishment of the task force and the holding of its inaugural meeting shortly.</P>
      <P>The forum report sets out proposals for the structuring of consultant posts both in the context of changed work patterns and a consultant delivered service.

Among the matters to be addressed are the core issues arising from the forum report and the report of the national joint <Col N="1357" /> steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, including flexibility and cover arrangements, teamworking and the issues highlighted in report No. 38 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public service.</P>

      <P>My Department does not support the funding of research on embryonic stem cells that might involve the creation of an embryo for research purposes. While this area of activity is not currently governed by any specific legislation, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council.

      <P>I am aware that there are concerns about the absence of a statutory framework for regulating this area.

The issues involved are complex with legal, ethical, social and medical implications. Accordingly, the commission is required to consult with interested parties, including philosophical and theological experts, so as to ensure that all perspectives are considered and reflected as appropriate. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

      <P>On 1 August 2001, I published the new Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001 to give effect to the proposals in the Government's policy document, Towards a Tobacco Free Society. I propose to introduce the Bill in the Dáil at the earliest possible date. I am particularly concerned over the levels of smoking among children and unrestricted access by under age persons to cigarettes from vending machines. About 30% of the adult population are severely addicted to nicotine in tobacco products and the vast majority of smokers become addicted in their childhood and teenage years. Many vending machines are located in areas of premises, often out of sight of staff, where there is no form of supervision.</P>
      <P>The new Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001 provides for much tighter controls on all aspects of tobacco retailing, including access to vending machines. I have informed the representative body of cigarette machine operators of the need for much tighter controls on cigarette vending machines. I have confirmed to them that future regulations in this area will be drafted in such a way as to provide for the sale of tobacco products in licensed premises only from vending machines activated for each sale by a unique coin or token available only from staff on the premises. The machines, which will have a locking device, will be located beside, on or behind the bar counter, under the direct supervision of staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical assessment and granting of a primary medical certificate for the purpose of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme is carried out by the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board. This function is to assist the Department of Finance which has statutory responsibility for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme. Accordingly, I have asked the chief executive officer, South Eastern Health Board to investigate this matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I also wish to draw the Deputy's attention to two other schemes which come under the aegis of my Department. The motorised transport grant is a means tested payment administered by the health boards. The purpose of this grant is to provide assistance for persons with a disability who may need a car to obtain-retain employment or to provide assistance for persons with a disability who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> To be eligible to receive the motorised transport grant applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving licence; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; the motorised transport must be a necessity in order for the person to obtain-retain employment or the person must have a transport requirement because of very isolated circumstances.</P>
    <P>Applications may also be considered in cases where persons with severe disabilities are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and therefore they must be driven to and from their place of employment. In such cases, the car must be purchased by the person with a disability and the name of the person who will drive this person to and from his or her place of employment must be notified to the relevant health board. The maximum motorised transport grant is currently £3,300, 4,190.14, with effect from 1 April 2001.</P>
    <P>The mobility allowance is a means tested payment which is administered by the health boards. The purpose of the allowance is to provide financial support for severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport, for example, to finance the occasional taxi journey.</P>
    <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings; an eligible person who is benefiting from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme receive the mobility allowance up to a maximum of £45.60, 57.90, per month. If an eligible person is not benefiting from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme, he or she may avail of the mobility allowance up to a maximum of £90, 114.28, per month.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. If a person feels that he or she may qualify for the motorised transport grant or the mobility allowance, he or she should contact the relevant health board for further details and an application form.</P>

The courts have already clarified on a number of occasions since 1992 that there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to any secondary market value of licences. There are no current proposals for mitigation measures beyond those provided for in the Finance Act, 2001, and in the scheme of taxi licence fee refunds by certain local authorities.</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to this position, I had requested from SIPTU at a meeting on 25 July 2001, a submission categorising cases of specific hardship which may not be fully covered by the current mitigation measures and I understand that this submission is being prepared by SIPTU.

      <P>Many effective measures to improve energy efficiency in houses can be achieved at negative or zero equivalent annual cost to the householder. The national climate change strategy, adopted by the Government, provides for intensification of educational and awareness programmes being undertaken by the Irish Energy Centre to promote these options and to fill the existing information gap for consumers. This is being undertaken on an ongoing basis through my Department's environmental awareness campaigns and the work of the Irish Energy Centre. The centre currently provides financial support to the fuel poverty charity, Energy Action in Dublin, to implement energy efficiency measures in both private and local authority dwellings. In addition a new research and development programme called the House of Tomorrow was launched by the centre in September last which has a specific target of superior energy efficiency in social and local authority housing. While individual householders are excluded from applying, it will be open to local authorities and other social <Col N="1370" /> housing providers to apply for funding under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since 1976, all new local authority housing has been built with wall cavity, attic and floor insulation. The standards of insulation required for new housing have been progressively improved in 1982, 1991, and again in 1997 under the building regulations. I envisage that further improvements will come into force with effect from 1 July 2002.</P>
      <P>My Department financially assists local authorities in upgrading, renovating and redeveloping their housing stock through the remedial works scheme and funding for regeneration and redevelopment projects. Works under the remedial works scheme must comply with the building regulations. The extent of works carried out to dwellings varies from project to project. Where an extensive programme of refurbishment works is carried out, measures are taken to improve thermal insulation in accordance with the building regulations. Some 14,500 dwellings have been refurbished since the inception of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to introduce an insulation grant for local authority tenants.</P>

      <P>The driver theory testing service is operated as a public private partnership project. The tendering process determined the test fee of £25.20 or 32.

    <P>Payment for the test may be made in a variety of ways, including payment by credit card, debit card, cheque, postal order and, in exceptional cir<Col N="1372" /> cumstances, by cash.

This latter arrangement facilitates the quick booking of a test appointment without the necessity of having to post a completed application form.</P>
    <P>A key performance standard contained in the customer charter for the driver theory testing service is that tests are to be offered at centres undertaking more than 250 tests per annum within two weeks of a candidate's preferred date.

    <P>The introduction of the test is a significant road safety measure and the costs to individuals must be viewed in the context of the benefit of the test to them in ensuring knowledge of good driving principles and road safety in general.</P>

The regulations governing the operation of this scheme currently provide for the following maximum loan limits for improvement loans: £15,000 or 19,046 &ndash; £20,000 or 25,395 on offshore islands where the loan is secured by a mortgage on the house, and £6,000 or 7,618 where the loan is not secured. It is a matter for the individual local authorities to specify whether or not a contribution is required from the borrower. I have no proposals, at this time, to change the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Rent supplements paid under the SWA scheme are administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Deputy is interested in the situation as it applies to all SWA rent supplement recipients and not just SWA rent supplement recipients who are asylum seekers. The position is that accommodation is not provided in the private rented sector by the State to asylum seekers or to any other groups. The individuals <Col N="1376" /> concerned locate their own accommodation in the private rented sector and enter into a contract with the landlord in their own right. They claim rent supplement subsequently when they are already the tenant of the accommodation in question.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must satisfy a means test. Health board must also satisfy itself that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need, that the property being rented is suitable to those needs and that a <i>bona fide </i>tenancy exists between the applicant and their landlord.</P>
    <P>It is not a requirement that the landlord is registered with the relevant local authority. To introduce such a requirement would inevitably lead to a restriction in choice of accommodation for applicants for SWA as only a minority of rented property is registered with local authorities. It would also lead to difficulties for tenants who have been living in unregistered accommodation for some time before the need to claim rent supplement first arose. Responsibility for enforcing both the housing standards and housing registration regulations rests with the local authorities. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance which will also be operated by the local authorities. This will increase the level of contact that local authorities have with the private rented sector and place them in a better position to enforce both the standards and registration regulations. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>Under a Government decision in July 2000 Departments and offices were required to commit their organisations to principles of quality customer service. One of these is &ldquo;Timeliness and Courtesy&rdquo;. Included in this principle is the requirement to &ldquo;give contact names in all communications to ensure ease of ongoing transactions&rdquo;. This example of good customer service has been a feature of our approach for some years now. The most recent reiteration of this can be found in my Department's customer action plan 2001-04 which was published in May 2001. The plan includes our commitment to quality customer service &ldquo;What You Can Expect From Us&rdquo;. On the subject of correspondence, we state that &ldquo;we will ensure that all letters and e-mails will carry a legible contact name and telephone number&rdquo;. This commitment can be seen in <Col N="1377" /> leaflet and poster form in our local and public offices. The provision of high quality correspondence to our customers is featured in a number of our staff training programmes. In particular, this issue is an integral element of our customer service training programme which has been delivered to more than 2,500 staff who deal with the public.</P>

      <Quest>the reason essential household expenditure on a mortgage is not taken into account when assessing applicants for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear &ndash; BSCF &ndash; allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year. An allowance of £63 or 79.99 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78 or  99.04 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.</P>
      <P>A person may qualify for payment of the BSCF allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain prescribed levels. Details of the income levels, which vary depending on the composition of the household, are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>These income levels relate to gross household income, net of PRSI and work related travel expenses. Mortgage costs are taken into account in certain circumstances. If the person applying for back to school clothing and footwear allowance is in receipt of a mortgage interest supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, then the amount of any such supplement is not counted as income for the purposes of the means test. The value of any exceptional needs payments made is similarly disregarded when assessing household income levels for the purpose of deciding entitlement to a BSCF allowance. However, if a person does not qualify for a SWA mortgage interest supplement, for example, on means grounds or because they are in full-time employment, then mortgage costs are not taken into account for the purposes of the BSCF means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by low income households when faced with providing <Col N="1378" /> clothing and footwear for children at back-to-school time in September each year. I am also very conscious of the importance of supporting low income families so that their children can participate fully in the education system to the maximum extent possible. In that regard, I have established a working group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is examining all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well as the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. I expect to have the working group's report early in the new year.</P>

      <Quest>if he will detail, of the 10,300 people in receipt of reduced pensions from his Department and who also have retirement pensions from the UK, the number of such pensioners who had their payments reviewed in the past 12 months; the number who have had their pensions reduced due to those reviews; and if he will compare these figures to those who received pension increases as a result of reviews when the punt/sterling ratio was reversed.</Quest>

      <P>Some 5,500 of the 10,300 pensioners receiving British pensions in addition to Irish non-contributory old age or a non-contributory widow/er's pension have had their entitlement reviewed this year. Of these, 3,430 pensioners or 62% had their Irish pensions reduced due to increases in their means; 110 pensioners or 2% had their pensions withdrawn as their means exceeded the statutory limits for entitlement; 1,680 pensioners or 31% experienced <Col N="1379" /> no change and a further 280 pensioners or 5% received an increase in their Irish pensions.</P>
      <P>Reviews of this nature are carried out periodically to ensure that the correct entitlement is being paid in cases where the pensioner has not requested a review in the light of a change in means. The reductions in pension where they occurred arose largely from the annual increase in British pensions over a number of years rather than any change in the punt/sterling relationship as such. Apart from these periodic reviews, the Department carries out some 2,000 pension claim reviews routinely per year, about three-quarters of which are undertaken at the pensioners' request. Of these routine reviews some 40% result in an increase in pension rate, with a further 35% resulting in no change. The balance of 25% of these reviews result in rate reductions or cessation of entitlement in cases where pensioners have significant increases in other means. Information is not available on the extent to which British retirement pensions are in payment in the cases reviewed in this way. It is, of course, open to any pensioner to request a review in the event of a reduction of means due to currency fluctuations or for any other reason.</P>

However, the person with whom she resides is not in receipt of a qualifying payment for the purposes of the scheme and her application for fuel allowance had to be refused.

      <Quest>the way in which the decision to transfer the family resource centres to the proposed family support agency may be reconciled with the commitment in his Department's White Paper, Supporting Voluntary Activity, that voluntary organisations have a right to be consulted about policy in relation to the design and delivery of services and programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 to 383, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium form the basis for the establishment of the family support agency. The Family Support Agency Bill was published on 13 July 2001 and is at present before Dáil Éireann. The new agency will bring together the main programmes and pro-family services introduced in recent years in line with the Government's &ldquo;Families First&rdquo; approach &ndash; to support families, promote continuity and stability in family life and prevent marital breakdown and foster a supportive community environment for families at local level. Some £12 million or 15.24 million has been allocated this year by the Government for the development of family services in the <Col N="1382" /> Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs &ndash; up from £1.5 million or 1.9 million in 1997. The family support agency will provide a family mediation service, support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationship counselling and other family support services, support, promote and develop the family and community services resource centre programme, provide information on these services and parenting issues, undertake research and advise me as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs about family matters.</P>
    <P>Thus the family support agency will provide a comprehensive and coherent response for families in need of these services and for families generally. All of these separate activities are currently taking place in my Department but it is my own view and that of the Government that a State agency affords the opportunity to bring a coherence into this complex area. The family and community services resource centres are an essential component of the Families First approach in building neighbourhood solidarity and responding to families locally. That is why they have been singled out by Government in recent years for radical improvement and expansion.</P>
    <P>In 1997, there were ten centres. In the Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to the establishment of 100 centres. To date there are 75 centres either operational or approved for inclusion in the programme. The family support agency legislation provides an enabling framework within which the Government has decided that the family and community services resource centres programme can be further developed. The family support agency will be an important resource to the work of the centres enhancing the role and capacity of these local community initiatives in responding to families at neighbourhood level. Reassurances about all of these matters, clarification of the Government proposals as set out in the Family Support Agency Bill, the promotion and development of the centres' ways of working and identification of the administrative and practical issues to be addressed to ensure a smooth transfer of the programmes to the new agency when it is established are the focus of ongoing discussions between officials of my Department and the FRC forum.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department met with representatives of the family and community services resource centres on 6 July 2001. A meeting with representatives of the FRC forum took place on 26 September and a further meeting at official level is planned for 13 November. I plan to officially launch the forum later this week. All of these events are taking place in the spirit of participation and co-working in pursuit of a common aim &ndash; in this case the well being of families &ndash; as envisaged in the Government White Paper on supporting voluntary activity which also affirms the fundamental responsibility of Government for setting the direction of policy in social and economic issues. The Government plans for the <Col N="1383" /> family support agency were first announced on 15 May 2001 &ndash; UN International Day of Families. Representatives from over 300 voluntary and community groups providing family support services, the social partners and public representatives were invited to the launch.</P>

      <P>Details of the grant aid offered on a county basis under the ACCESS schemes are outlined in the following table. The Deputy will note that grants have been allocated in 21 counties. Grants may be drawn down over the period 2001-04.</P>
      <P>The centre in question applied for ACCESS funding but unfortunately was not recommended by the independent committee established by me to assess all eligible applications. Only applications recommended by the independent committee were considered by me for the purposes of grant allocations.</P>
      <P>A total of £36 million, 46 million, is available for the ACCESS scheme from 2001-04, but applications for grant aid of £224 million were received. Difficult decisions therefore had to be made, with many worthwhile projects having to be refused.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to his question of 3 July 2001, proposals for the provision of visitor facilities are at a very early stage and it is not possible at this point in time to give a timetable for this major project. However, I can assure the Deputy that, notwithstanding the substantial funding which I have already provided for this project to date, I have ensured that Castletown will benefit from the funds allocated to me under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 which will, <i>inter alia,</i> enable my Department to press ahead with the provision of visitor facilities. I am confident that the proposed provision of visitor facilities <Col N="1386" /> will greatly enhance the attraction of this historical property as a tourism destination of significant importance.</P>

      <P>An application was submitted by the theatre company concerned for ACCESS funding. All eligible applications were evaluated by an independent committee established by me for that purpose. As the application in question was not among those recommended to me by the committee, it was not successful. Only applications recommended by the independent committee were considered by me for the purposes of grant allocations. Total funds available for ACCESS come to £36 million, while applications were received for grant aid totalling £224 million. Difficult decisions therefore had to be made, with many worthwhile projects having to be refused.</P>

      <P>Various schemes to assist the trans<Col N="1388" /> port sector in the Gaeltacht have been operated by Gaeltarra Éireann and its successor Údarás na Gaeltachta since 1971. Among those schemes, for example, were schemes for the transport of fish for fish farming and fish processing projects and the transport of wood in areas where the forestry industry is strong. In total, assistance was approved for 41 projects and £530,494, in all, was paid in grants since 1971. The following table sets out the details of these grants. It should be noted that some payments may still have to be made in respect of cases that had been approved prior to the discontinuance of the schemes.</P>

My Department has had in place, for some time, administrative arrangements designed to facilitate the exercise of these rights, subject to the provisions of the agreements. Advice is currently being sought from the Office of the Attorney General on whether the findings of the court have implications for any aspect of current practice in this regard.

To this end, the United Nations, with strong support from Ireland, is drawing up a comprehensive convention on terrorism, aimed at maximising the effectiveness of the international response to terrorist offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 govern the mechanisms employed to determine an application for refugee status under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its related 1967 protocol. The criteria governing the grant of refugee status in the State are contained in section 2 of the 1996 Act. These criteria apply equally to all applications for a declaration as a refugee having regard to the subjective fear of an applicant and to objective country of origin information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain classes of person are excluded from the definition of a refugee under the terms of the 1951 Convention. These include persons who have committed a crime against peace, a war crime, a crime against humanity or a serious non-political crime and the provisions of the Act of 1996 reflect those exclusions. However, it is a requirement of the Act of 1996 that any person who approaches the frontiers of the State and makes an application for asylum must be given leave to remain in the State for the purposes of having his or her asylum claim determined. The same applies in the case of an asylum applicant who is already in the State. In each case and prior to a final decision being made regarding eligibility for status, an asylum applicant is entitled to benefit from the asylum determination process as enshrined in the 1996 Act. Each applicant is <Col N="1391" /> entitled to have his or her case determined by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, where appropriate, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal who make a recommendation to the Minister in relation to applications for asylum, depending on the circumstances applicable in each case, which includes consideration of detailed country of origin information. In that context it is open to the Refugee Applications Commissioner to seek additional information from the Garda Síochána and for the Garda Síochána to make additional information available to that office where it is considered that such information may be relevant to the circumstances of the case. If a positive recommendation is made to the Minister he is entitled under the 1996 Act to have regard to the interest of national security or public policy prior to granting a declaration of status. The mechanisms employed to address the circumstances comprehended by the Deputy's questions are kept under constant review but I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the application of those mechanisms. I assure the Deputy that arising from the dreadful attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, international co-operation in the fight against terrorism has been enhanced. Ireland will not be found wanting in this regard and the Garda Síochána are co-operating fully with the current world wide investigations into these atrocities. At EU level, the meeting of the special Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held on 20 September 2001 invited the European Commission to examine urgently the relationship between safeguarding internal security and complying with international protection obligations and instruments. I understand this examination is being undertaken at present. In addition, the Security Council of the United Nations has adopted Resolution No. 1373 which, <i>inter alia</i>, calls on states to take appropriate measures in conformity with the relevant provisions of national and international law, including international standards of human rights, before granting refugee status, for the purpose of ensuring that an asylum seeker has not planned, facilitated or participated in the commission of terrorist acts, and ensure, in conformity with international law, that refugee status is not abused by the perpetrators, organisers or facilitators of terrorist acts. At national level, having due regard to our obligations under international law including our obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention and the related 1967 protocol, and to ongoing developments at EU level and at the United Nations, we will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the State is properly protected including when meeting our obligations in the area of international protection.</P>

      <P>Prison records over the entire life of Mountjoy Prison since 1850 are incomplete. The indications are, however, that the remains of everyone executed there between 1900 and 1954, with the exception of remains of persons executed during the period of Civil War, were buried in the grounds of the prison in unmarked graves. The only graves in respect of which a precise record was kept were those of the ten volunteers executed in the 1920-21 period and exhumed in recent months at the request of their families. There is no request from any quarter for the exhumation of the remains of any other person interred at the prison. Even if such a request were to be made, there would be significant obstacles to the successful exhumation and identification of such remains.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 402 and 403 together.</P>
      <P>Section 15(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 1924 penalises the unlawful possession of Garda clothing and equipment. It also makes it an offence for someone who is not a Garda to wear Garda clothing or any &ldquo;colorable imitation&rdquo;, or for a person to falsely assume the name, designation or description of a Garda. Consideration is being given to improving the protection of Garda insignia and emblems through legislation. Details of these plans will be made known in the usual way when the Government has decided on its approach to the matter.</P>

    <P>I am further informed that licensed premises are strictly monitored and regulations enforced in the Donegal division and, as a result of the campaign, licensees are becoming more aware of their responsibilities in relation to under age drinking.</P>
    <P>I believe that the current age card scheme <Col N="1395" /> coupled with the substantial changes provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, is proving an effective deterrent against under age drinking. However, I am keeping the scheme under continual review and, in that context, I have recently established a review group within my Department which, in consultation with the Garda, will examine the operation of the scheme with a view to identifying any defects coming to light and, if necessary, make appropriate recommendations. I expect that this group will report to me by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Conroy Commission have, in the past 30 years, to a large degree been fully implemented. Further major improvements over and above those recommended by the commission have taken <Col N="1396" /> place in those years. The commission's report has now been overtaken by the strategic management initiative which conducted a fundamental review of all aspects of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. That review was completed in November 1997. The Government appointed a steering group in February 1998. Implementation of the SMI recommendations will position the Garda organisation to respond efficiently and effectively to the challenges it faces in this new millennium.</P>

It is estimated that as many as 25% of patrons are from Northern Ireland, but I understand that the Garda authorities do not consider that there is any substantial difference between their behaviour and local patrons. The Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources are deployed to meet the requirements in this area.</P>

A technical assessment of this application was carried out before the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, considered this application. On foot of the recommendation of the programme appraisal committee, I approved a capital grant of £40,000, 50,789.52 to the applicant on 10 October 2001. My Department's equal opportunities child care section has notified the applicant of my decision.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that Celbridge <Col N="1398" /> Garda station is in the Carlow-Kildare division with its district headquarters at Naas station. The current personnel strength (all ranks) of Celbridge Garda station as at 1 October 2001 is 19, compared to a figure of 12 on 31 December 1997. This represents an increase of seven or 58.33% in the personnel allocated to Celbridge during that period. There are 18 vehicles attached to the district of Naas, with two vehicles assigned to Celbridge station. The allocation of vehicles to Celbridge station is comparable to areas with similar size and population throughout the country. Garda manpower assigned to the greater Dublin area, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, is continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the situation will be kept under review and, when additional manpower next becomes available, the needs of Celbridge will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 139 states have signed the statute and, of these, 43 have ratified it.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary for my Department to bring forward implementing legislation to give effect to the terms of the Rome statute in Irish law following the successful outcome of the constitutional referendum on the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. The Rome statute is a very complex instrument that requires detailed consideration to establish exactly what will be required by way of legislation to enable us to ratify it. The legislation required to give effect in Irish law to the statute will be very substantial considering the complex issues that arise to be dealt with. A careful and detailed examination of the statute is taking place in my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office, to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be taken so that we will be in a position to meet our obligations under the statute, and substantial progress is being made in this regard.</P>
      <P>The legislative changes needed to give effect to the statute in Irish law, following completion of this examination, will be introduced as quickly as possible having regard to other high priority legislative requirements. At an international level, the Rome statute is being discussed in a number of fora, for example, the Council of Europe, with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner and we are taking an active part in those discussions.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 9 October 2001 in which I detailed the current status of the application in question. I assure the Deputy that there has been no undue delay in dealing with this funding application. In March 2001, I approved a capital grant of IR£12,424, 15,775, to the persons in question. Following my approval of a grant, an applicant must enter into a contractual agreement with ADM Limited, acting on my Department's behalf. Prior to entering into a contract, ADM may seek additional information such as evidence of planning permission or evidence of matching funding. These issues are addressed in a pre-contract letter, which I understand issued to the applicants on 18 March 2001.</P>
      <P>A reply was received from the applicants in May 2001. I understand that a number of contacts were subsequently made with the applicants to clarify certain points, in particular the issue of matching funding. Details of matching funding were received from the applicants on 1 August 2001 and ADM Limited issued the contract the following day. I understand that the signed contract was received from the applicants on 9 August 2001. A payment of IR£9,318, 11,831, which amounts to 75% of the total funding approved, was made to the applicants in September 2001. Once again, I would like to assure the Deputy that there has been no undue delay on the part of my officials in dealing with this particular case and I hope that the above clarification is of assistance to the Deputy.</P>

      <QRef>[25246/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): With regard to best practice regarding the search for missing <Col N="1402" /> persons, the Garda authorities assure me that the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases are continually reviewed. On an international level, the Garda Síochána liaises with Interpol and relevant non-governmental organisations, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>At present, where the gardaí consider that a person is genuinely missing, a full Garda investigation takes place under the supervision and direction of the local district officer. An investigation team is immediately convened, which draws together any specialist resources which the district officer considers are necessary to locate the missing person. In addition, every district has a specially trained search team which is familiar with the locality. At division level, investigations are co-ordinated by the relevant Chief Superintendent. I assure the Deputy that all files on missing persons remain open until there is a conclusion to the case and each case is kept under continuous review. Many searches have taken place and further searches will be carried out if new evidence or information comes to hand. The deployment of Garda resources and the investigative methods used in missing persons cases are matters for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed that the Commissioner considers that such investigations are more effective when they have the kind of local focus that is achieved under existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>Internationally, the support mechanisms in place to support the families of missing persons are usually through a number of charitable and voluntary organisations. One example is the national missing persons helpline UK, which provides information and support to family members and missing persons. The funding of a dedicated helpline, counselling service and other support facilities for the families of missing persons is not a function that would normally fall within my functional remit. However, in deference to concerns expressed on this matter, I have instructed my Department to examine the issue and it is currently in discussions with a state-funded organisation in relation to the provision of a helpline. Moreover, I understand that health boards may be in a position to offer appropriate counselling and support services to those members of a declared missing person's family who are identified as being in need of such services. I further understand that the provision of these services is, in the first instance, a matter for each health board, having regard to needs in individual cases.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of persons who were untraced at the end of each year, from 1990 to 1999 (the last year for which published figures are available) is as set out in the following table, together with provisional statistics for the year 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the introduction of the &ldquo;Integrated Title Registration Information System&rdquo; (ITRIS) in July 1999 was a major step forward for the Land Registry and its customers. This system, which is designed to electronically store and manage Land Registry information, is being rolled out on a gradual basis across the organisation. ITRIS is currently available in nine counties &ndash; Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow, Cork, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Clare and Roscommon &ndash; serving over 60% of the applications lodged in the Land Registry. It will be extended to County Waterford in the next few weeks, to counties Kerry and Limerick during January 2002 and it is planned to have it operational in all counties by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that there has been no delay in extending the ITRIS system. The Land Registry's stated policy has, at all times, been to introduce the system strategically and on a gradual basis. The introduction of the ITRIS system has also been communicated to the registry's customers via its customer group. As the Deputy will appreciate, there are a number of reasons for this introduction strategy, including the essential training of staff who operate the new system; the provision of information to, and having ongoing liaison and discussions with, solicitors and other customers prior to its roll out in each county and the making of the necessary infrastructural and technical changes and alterations to allow the system to function. These have been accomplished, to date, and have been managed effectively and successfully in challenging circumstances whilst dealing with record levels of intake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that a key element of this new system is its &ldquo;electronic access service&rdquo; (EAS). This enables customers of the Land Registry, who subscribe to the service, to conduct on line searches of folios and names index records through the Internet, where the folios are held in electronic format and to order copies of certain documents electronically. The EAS is one of the flagship initiatives undertaken under the information society action plan and electronic Government programme. The Deputy may wish to note that the Land Registry was the first Government Department or office to go live with such a system. The EAS is already operating very successfully and over 2,500 customer accounts are currently in operation. A measure of its success is that almost 1,000 business trans<Col N="1405" /> actions are being electronically undertaken by customers of the service each day.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that there is also a need to convert all existing ownership records into electronic format and the Land Registry is currently implementing a strategy to systematically capture all paper folios and their associated maps. This project is being undertaken on a county by county basis, over a three year period, and when complete, all folios and filed plans held by the Land Registry, estimated at over 6.4 million images, will be available to customers in electronic format, both directly from the Land Registry offices and over the Internet.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the situation in relation to the processing of Land Registry dealings is as set out in the following tabular statement. As the Deputy will appreciate, the length of time taken to complete cases varies, depending on a number of factors including the complexity of the case, the completeness of the documentation forwarded by the solicitors, the need for further documentation, etc. The volume of business being transacted at any stage would also have a bearing on matters. The Deputy may also wish to note that any cases involving urgency are, in accordance with the customer service policy of the Land Registry, dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>I should also point out to the Deputy that the statistics provided in the first column of the tabular statement, not requiring subdivision/creation of a new title, represent almost 70% of the total intake of cases by the Land Registry.</P>

    <P>*The figures shown for Kildare/Wicklow and Cork represent the time frame for any case lodged since the roll out of ITRIS. I have been informed by the Land Registry that pre-ITRIS cases in these areas are taking approximately 22 months to complete in Kildare and Wicklow and 14 months in Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> As the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the increased activity in the property market, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds has grown to an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. From current figures available it appears that the intake of applications for 2001 will be approximately 160,000. The Deputy will be aware that last year, in order to address the increasing intake of applications, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing compliment of the Land Registry by 77. Most of these appointments were made during the past year and the training of the new staff is now beginning to pay dividends. Already this year, to the end of September, over 112,000 dealings, representing an increase in output for the same period of almost 47% over year 2000, have been completed. I can also inform the Deputy that I have recently received sanction for a further 19 temporary posts, and a recruitment drive to fill these posts is at present in progress.</P>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that the ITRIS (Integrated Title Registration Information System) is now operational in nine counties which represent over 60% of all dealings lodged. The ITRIS will be extended to all counties by the end of 2002. I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the situation. The Land Registry management are implementing some proactive measures, including improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps. I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will continue to improve.</P>

In addition to the accommodation provided to asylum seekers by the reception and integration agency of my Department &ndash; currently 5,000 places in 77 centres in 24 counties &ndash; health boards throughout the country are also involved through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in providing accommodation to asylum seekers who they deem are not suitable to have their needs met under the system of direct provision.</P>

    <P>When procuring accommodation facilities, the reception and integration agency, has regard to the requirement to achieve to the greatest extent possible a balanced distribution of asylum seekers <Col N="1407" /> throughout the State commensurate with, <i>inter alia</i>, availability and capacity of services such as health, welfare and education as well as local population and infrastructure. The provision and resourcing of statutory services to asylum seekers are matters, in the first instance, for the appropriate Government Departments and the agencies operating under their aegis. Moreover, officers have been seconded to the reception and integration Agency from the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Environment and Local Government and from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Dublin Corporation so as to co-ordinate service delivery to asylum seekers at local level and to liaise with local statutory service providers and the appropriate Government Departments.</P>

The proposals submitted by these projects will be considered for funding under initiatives aimed at tackling educational disadvantage. Resources allocated under these programmes are used for the provision of a range of holistic supports to enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in school. These initiatives include the fund for the development of targeted educational responses to certain children at risk. The objective of this initiative is to develop preventative and supportive programmes, which are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. The key focus is the empowerment of local communities to develop innovative and flexible programmes that address identified needs of intended participants. A committee comprised of relevant sections within my Department will meet shortly to consider proposals received. A large number of applications have been received, from which the selection committee will recommend a list of projects to be funded, together with the amount of grant in each case, having regard to the overall funding available for the purpose. A response will be communicated to all concerned as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment (CE) schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes (CE) come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £100 &ndash; 126.98 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £60 &ndash; 76.18 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 &ndash; 3,047.37 &ndash; to £4,800 &ndash; 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; to £40,000 &ndash; 50,789.52 &ndash; per annum. My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on <Col N="1410" /> transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash; 2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the recommendations of the consultants. The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 432 and 458 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to a recent ruling of the European Court of Justice which held that the provisions of the relevant Community directive, concerning non-discrimination and European citizenship, preclude entitlement to non-contributory social benefits from being made conditional on a criterion which need not be satisfied by nationals of the host member state in question. The ruling, which relates to the case of a French national studying in Belgium and his entitlement under the social welfare system of that country, appears to have implications for the social welfare systems in all EU member states. It is not possible, however, at this point to state what the implications are with regard to each individual state. The Court did point out that member states may require students wishing to benefit from the right of residence on their territory to declare that they have, in accordance with a community directive, sufficient resources for themselves and, in relevant cases, for their family, in order to avoid becoming a burden on the social assistance scheme of the host member state. The Court accepted, however, that a student's financial position may change with the passage of time for reasons beyond his/her control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards supports available from my Department for Irish students studying in other EU member states, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third <Col N="1411" /> level courses in other EU member states. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years' duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are however a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses, including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education. In order to qualify for grant assistance, a candidate must satisfy the relevant conditions of the student support schemes in regard to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 433 and 465 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year. Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £100 &ndash; 126.98 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £60 &ndash; 76.18 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 &ndash; 3,047.37 &ndash; to £4,800 &ndash; 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or <Col N="1412" /> more will increase from £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; to £40,000 &ndash; 50,789.52 &ndash; per annum.</P>
    <P>My Department provides funding to the centre referred to by the Deputies in respect of the special school which forms part of the centre and I am increasing the funding to all special schools over and above the increases that will apply to mainstream schools as outlined above. The rate of grant for special schools will increase from its current level of £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £130 &ndash; 165.07 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £105 &ndash; 133.32 &ndash; per pupil in January. My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash; 2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    <P>Finally, schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a school bus pick-up point. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently received a report regarding a re-routing of the school transport service for the children from the area referred to by the Deputy. The children reside between 0.3 miles and 0.9 miles from the route of the existing bus service. This is within current guidelines and accordingly it is not proposed to re-route the service in question.</P>

I further understand that the detailed planning scheme for the area is currently in preparation.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 440, 477 and 479 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding to primary and second level schools on the basis of <i>per capita</i> grants with additional grants towards ancillary services such as caretaking and secretarial. Responsibility for the operation of CE schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40, 50.79, per pupil per annum to £100, 126.98, per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40, 50.79, to £60, 76.18, per pupil. This will be further increased to £80, 101.58, per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37, to £4,800, 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76, to £40,000, 50,789.52, per annum.</P>
      <P>At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20, 25.40, per pupil to £50, 63.49, per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70, 88.88, per pupil next September. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita </i>grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. These increases are in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000, 5,078.96, to £15,600, 19,807.91, per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000, 12,697.38, to £39,000, 49,519.79, over this school year and the next. In the case of second level schools receiving grants of £55, 69.84, per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to maximum of £19,250, 24,442.46, per school, the annual grant of £78, 99.04, under the services support fund will bring the combined total for a 500 pupil school to £58,250, 73,962.24, per year. My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the <Col N="1417" /> new funding arrangements. It is intended that payments will issue to schools shortly.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million, 2,539,476, to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that took place in connection with the transfer of funding, I agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools. I am aware that FÁS has issued guidelines to its regional offices that reflect the agreement that I have referred to above.</P>

      <P>Under present arrangements my Department provides funding to meet the special equipment needs of pupils with disabilities in primary, post-primary and special schools. The funding is allocated to school authorities to purchase the relevant equipment for use of the pupils concerned, including those with specific learning disabilities.</P>
      <P>Allocations of equipment grants are based on an assessed level of need of individual pupils. Applications from schools for such equipment must be supported by the relevant assessment reports, for example psychological assessment, occupational therapy/physiotherapy reports. A report from the relevant school inspector is also required.</P>

      <P>The process by which an educational institution may be established as a university is as set out in section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997. There are no plans at present to initiate this process with a view to upgrading the Institute of Technology Tralee to university status. In July 1996, the Government approved in principle the <Col N="1418" /> recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector subject to regular review. The steering committee report endorsed the maintenance of a diversified system of higher education to meet the varying needs of students, society and the economy. The report did not recommend any change in status for the Institutes of Technology.</P>
      <P>On 11 June last, I commenced the remaining parts of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999. Under the provisions of this Act, it is open to Institutes of Technology to apply for delegated authority to make awards within a national qualifications framework.</P>
      <P>My policy is to continue to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level systems of university and technological education. The diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements. The Institute of Technology, Tralee will continue to play a major role in Irish higher education.</P>

      <P>The distribution and time-tabling of teaching hours across subject areas is a matter for the VEC to determine in the light of student demand and programme coherence. My inquiries into the matter raised by the Deputy show that any re-distribution in the teaching hours involved in the vocational training opportunities scheme courses in Dungarvan has been minimal and arose from the dropping of some modules to <Col N="1419" /> ensure an improved certification mix. There was also a change in the number of hours that the VTOS co-ordinator was required to teach, in accordance with arrangements introduced for the management of VTOS centres. There has been no reduction this year in the overall amount of 90 hours tuition per week provided last year.</P>

      <P>I have investigated the case arising from the Deputy's question. The National Educational Psychological Service Agency provides a psychological service to this school. The child concerned receives and will continue to receive learning support in a small group. This child was the subject of a consultation between the learning support teacher and the psychologist in September 2001. The school did not consider the child as a priority for referral to the psychologist at that time. In view of the Deputy's concern, however, the psychologist will review the matter on her next visit to the school, which will take place this week.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding to secondary schools on the basis of<i> per capita</i> grants with additional grants towards ancillary services such as caretaking and secretarial. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of secondary schools, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund, which I introduced last year. With immediate effect, schools will receive an increase in the annual support grant from £20, 25.40, per pupil to £50, 63.49, per pupil, with a further increase to £70, 88.88, per pupil next September and to £78, 99.04, per pupil in January 2003. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to<i> per capita </i>grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for smaller schools will increase from £4,000, 5,078.96, to £15,600, 19,807.91, per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000, 12,697.38, to £39,000, 49,519.79, over this school year and the next. In the case of schools receiving grants of £55, 69.84, per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to a maximum of £19,250, 24,442.46, per school, the annual grant of <Col N="1423" /> £78, 99.04, per pupil under the services support fund will bring the combined total for a 500 pupil school to £58,250 (73,962.24). My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million, 2,539,476, to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this school is a principal and seven mainstream class teachers based on the enrolment of 205 as at 30 September 2000. This is the authorised staffing for the school. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher and a resource teacher.</P>
      <P>All eligible pupils in the school in question are in receipt of resource teaching support through their inclusion on the caseload of a full-time resource teacher which the school shares with two other school in the area. The level of resource teacher support currently allocated for pupils in the school is based on their assessed needs. These did not warrant the allocation of a full time resource teaching post solely to this school. The organisation of classes within the school is a matter for the board of management in consultation with the school principal.</P>

      <P>In relation to the income thresholds prescribed under the student maintenance grant schemes, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. Last June, in line with this policy, I approved an increase of 6.5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2001-2002 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the reference period, March 1999 to March 2000, which was 5.9%. I also increased by 6.5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of assessing reckonable income under the schemes, a candidate's reckonable income is defined as all income for the previous tax year, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being disregarded.</P>
      <P>For the 2002-03 academic year, reckonable income will be based on the short transitional tax year running from 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001. In general, for revenue purposes, all allowances, credits, bands, exemption limits and other annual amounts will be adjusted, where relevant, from their full year value to take account of the short tax year. Similarly, it is intended that the reckonable income thresholds, to be prescribed in my Department's schemes of student support for 2002, will be adjusted accordingly. The schemes of student support, with prescribed reckonable income limits, are normally issued in May-June of each year and it is intended that the issue of the 2002 schemes will adhere to this practice.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The current staffing of Holy Cross Primary School is a principal and 15 mainstream class teachers, which is based on the enrolment of 444 as at 30 September 2000. The school also has a learning support teacher. The enrolment of the school as at 30 September 2001 will determine the staffing levels for the 2002/2003 school year. The only deviation from the agreed arrangements is in the case of developing schools. The increase in enrolment between 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2001 does not satisfy the criteria for the allocation of an additional post for the 2001-02 school year.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is one of two schools currently serving the post-primary needs of the area concerned. The combined enrolment of these schools, currently at around 720, has declined significantly in recent years. Projections indicate that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. In the circumstances, the issue of rationalisation of post-primary facilities in the area was raised with both sets of trustees last year. A decision regarding the accommodation needs of the school concerned awaits the outcome of these deliberations. The school authorities have been advised, however, that any works required at the school on health and safety grounds will be considered for grant aid.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy applied to my Department in 1997 for capital grant aid in respect of additional accommodation. Similar applications have since been received from the four other post-primary schools which share the same catchment area. As a direct result of these applications, and in view of the projected long-term enrolment of the five schools concerned, which indicates that post-primary pupil numbers in the catchment area are in decline, my Department decided to examine the scope for rationalising post-primary education provision in the centre. Letters issued to the trustees of the five schools concerned in August 2001 inviting them to consider the issue of rationalisation. One of the trustees has replied stating they are interested in participating in discussions regarding rationalisation. The remaining four trustees have replied stating that they are considering the matter. As soon as definitive replies are received from the other trustees, the scope for rationalisation will be considered further. In the meantime, the building project at the school in question has been put on hold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the concerns of the group referred to by the Deputy. My Department provides funding for primary and secondary schools on the basis of <i>per capita </i>grants with additional grants towards ancillary services such as caretaking and secretarial. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million, 40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40, 50.79, per pupil per annum to £100, 126.98, per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40, 50.79, to £60, 76.18, per pupil. This will be further increased to £80, 101.58, per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37, to £4,800, 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76, to £40,000, 50,789.52, per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of secondary schools, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund, which I introduced <Col N="1433" /> last year. With immediate effect, schools will receive an increase in the annual support grant from £20, 25.40, per pupil to £50, 63.49, per pupil, with a further increase to £70, 88.88, per pupil next September and to £78, 99.04, per pupil in January 2003. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for smaller schools will increase from £4,000, 5,078.96, to £15,600, 19,807.91, per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000, 12,697.38, to £39,000, 49,519.79, over this school year and the next. In the case of schools receiving grants of £55, 69.84, per pupil for secretaries and caretakers, up to a maximum of £19,250, 24,442.46, per school, the annual grant of £78, 99.04, per pupil under the services support fund will bring the combined total for a 500 pupil school to £58,250, 73,962.24. My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million, 2,539,476, to respond to the recommendations of the consultants. In the discussions that took place in connection with the transfer of funding, I agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools. I am aware that FÁS has issued guidelines to its regional offices that reflect the agreement that I have referred to above.</P>

      <P>Admission to the Higher Diploma in Education course is a matter in the first instance <Col N="1434" /> for the authorities of the university concerned. However, admission to the course is generally confined to those applicants who hold a third level qualification that is recognised for the purposes of teaching in a second level school. The Registration Council is a statutory body charged with the recognition of qualifications for the purpose of teaching in secondary schools. In this context, it is necessary for a teacher to hold a degree or equivalent qualification and a teacher training qualification both of which must be recognised by the Registration Council.</P>
      <P>In order for such qualifications to be considered for general recognition, the awarding authority must apply to the Registration Council for recognition. I understand that, to date, the Registration Council has received no such application in respect of the qualification in question. If the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, wishes to apply for recognition of the qualification, the Registration Council will process the application in accordance with the council's normal procedures.</P>
      <P>In relation to the postgraduate diploma in primary teaching, part of the academic requirements for admission to the course is that applicants are required to have an approved third level degree. As is the case with the Higher Diploma in Education, admission to the postgraduate diploma is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the colleges of education.</P>
      <P>In addition to an approved third level degree, persons applying for the postgraduate diploma in primary teaching must also have secured an honour in Irish and a pass in both English and Mathematics in the leaving certificate examination or approved equivalents.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently increased the number of psychologists in NEPS from 43 to 88. At my request the Civil Service Commission has recently advertised for further educational psychologists for appointment to NEPS. A high priority will be given to assigning successful applicants to regions that are currently under-staffed, including the mid-western region. I have been concerned for some time about children with special educational needs in schools that do not yet have access to the psychological service provided by NEPS. I have, therefore, recently made funding available to NEPS to allow such schools to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has drawn up and issued to all schools, including those in County Limerick, guidelines on how to avail of this scheme.</P>
