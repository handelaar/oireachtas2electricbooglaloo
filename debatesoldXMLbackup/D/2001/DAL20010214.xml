      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following issue of public importance: how the Government proposes to implement the latest measures proposed by the EU Commission to make beef production less intensive and how it intends to address the need to internalise the costs to the environment of food production methods which would, in turn, make organic production more competitive.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 25, Motion re. Functions of Select Committees; No. 5, Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 52, Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Order for Report Stage and Report and Final Stages; No. 6, Valuation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage and No. 7, Local Government Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order of Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 25 shall be decided without debate. Private Members' business shall be No. 112, Motion re. Report of the Ombudsman on Nursing Home Subventions (Resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>Before I indicate agreement or disagreement to the Order of Business, I would like the Taoiseach to inform the House where his party stands on the amendment of Standing Orders, along the lines of Motion No. 129 on the Order Paper, to allow leaders of Opposition parties to raise a matter of topical interest with the Taoiseach each morning on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on the Order of Business yesterday, as per the Ceann Comhairle's suggestion last week that there should be a meeting of the Committee on Dáil Reform, a meeting of the committee took place last night. I understand it was a lengthy and difficulty meeting but progress was made. Those talks will continue this morning and during the day. As the Ceann Comhairle suggested last week, it is his preference that the House would bring forward a standing order. This has my support and we should work to achieve this in the committee. We should also agree some basis on how to deal with other Dáil reform issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach. Progress was made last night. My party wants to deal with this issue as a stand alone issue without prejudice to any further decision which might be made on the wider issue of Dáil reform. I acknowledge the <Col N="699" /> progress made and will not oppose the Order of Business. The Fine Gael Whip will be available for further talks during the day.</P>

      <P>That is what the Government is trying to do. I want to inform you, a Cheann Comhairle, in your capacity as Chairperson of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to which the so-called sub-committee would report in the first instance, that we were not at the meeting last night and will not be at the meeting today. The House should be aware that if a proposal comes from these discussions it will come from joint co-operation between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on this matter.</P>

      <P>The new Fine Gael Party has much to learn about romance and the art of seduction because last night it spurned the advances of the smaller parties and the Independents and it now seems that it will hop into bed with Fianna Fáil.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Yesterday the Leader of Fine Gael said he would not be silenced in raising matters of importance on the Order of Business. There is no chance of this happening as Fine Gael has sufficient numbers to ensure that the Government has to agree. Shamefully, Fine Gael and the Government agreed last night that the group of small parties and Independent Deputies who do not support the Government would be silenced and excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposal from six Deputies &ndash; the Deputies from the Green Party, the Socialist Party and Sinn Féin and Deputies Gregory and Healy &ndash; which is only one short of the formal seven required under Standing Orders to form a group. We put forward a reasonable proposal that, along with the Leaders of the Opposition <Col N="700" /> parties being called on topical matters on the Order of Business, one Deputy from that group of six would also be selected on a daily basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Procedures are laid down in Standing Orders for changing Standing Orders. These procedures are cast in such a way as to ensure that a simple majority of Members cannot impose their will on the House. That is as it should be.</P>
      <P>A meeting took place last night effectively between the Government parties and our new socialist friends in Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is signed by Deputies Flanagan and Seamus Brennan. That presumptuous proposal would require the Labour Party to take part in a committee in which we have decided not to take part until changes are made to legislation regarding the funding of elections. It is presumptuous of the main Opposition party to table this kind of motion. I am sure the Government is happy to go along with Fine Gael which will put Members into a straitjacket the result of which will be much worse than that about which we complained previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither do I wish to take away rights or privileges which other parties have or had. I wish to restore the <i>status quo ante</i> whereby my predecessor was able to raise matters on the Order of Business under your ruling, a Cheann <Col N="701" /> Comhairle. You, for reasons you have explained, have withdrawn the extension of that privilege and we require an amendment to Standing Orders to restore it.</P>
      <P>I have no problem joining the leader of the Green Party or any other group to extend the <i>status quo</i> to include them. However, Fine Gael is a distinct and separate party. I am going to lead the party in this House and I am going to restore the <i>status quo ante.</i> I seek the co-operation of all Members to do so. I will ensure that I am not silenced in the House. I am going to have the same rights enjoyed by my predecessor to raise matters of public importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach told the House that I was wrong in claiming that the practice required of him is different from that required of his predecessors. Last night I examined the <i>status quo ante.</i> I found one instance in which, on 12 occasions in one hour, the Taoiseach, when leader of the Opposition, was afforded the same latitude given to Deputies Quinn and John Bruton but which is being denied to Deputy Noonan.</P>
      <P>On 15 October 1996, Deputy Bertie Ahern raised a matter which went on for 50 minutes and involved 12 members of his front bench. The same happened on 12 other occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The same situation applied on 12 other occasions within one hour. Will the Taoiseach have the good grace to acknowledge that he was wrong? On two occasions in this House he accused me of being wrong. The evidence is on the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of deteriorating industrial relations, will the Taoiseach establish a Cabinet sub-committee to ensure that the re-negotiated Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is protected in any negotiations to relieve the pressure that now exists right across the industrial sectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of potentially serious disputes, as Deputy Noonan mentioned. There will be talks today with the Aer Lingus group of unions that is back in the Labour Court, and I hope progress will be made on those issues. Also today, the implementation group formed as part of the 4 December agreement under the PPF will be dealing with the construction and related industries, and BATU. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach take the point that industrial relations problems are now spreading across the economy, from the teachers to the construction industry and the Aer Lingus group of unions? While individual Ministers have responsibility, taking into account how busy Cabi<Col N="705" /> net Ministers are, there is not an overview or a controlling group in Cabinet that is responsible. When one looks forward one can see that it will be a very rocky road on industrial relations for the next few months, so I am suggesting that a Cabinet sub-committee might be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet continually monitors this. In fact, there was a meeting this morning concerning one of the disputes, which was attended by a number of Ministers and me. The monitoring of the PPF, however, particularly under the 4 December agreement, is a specified implementation and control plan that was set down in that agreement. The difficulty is in making sure that is adhered to. I admit there are some difficulties surrounding a range of disputes but we are trying to ensure that particular section of the PPF, which was only agreed a little over two months ago, is adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Taoiseach to convene a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in light of the statement made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party that he would like to have the <i>status quo ante</i> restored. As the Taoiseach has properly said, this would require writing into the Standing Orders of the House the convention that previously prevailed. I suggest that the Taoiseach might consider that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. I also raise the stifling of democratic developments within this House, whereby two Bills which have passed Second Stage have been effectively stymied. One has been vetoed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; that is the Bill to regulate and prohibit corporate donations to political parties. Later today, the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government will meet and will discuss correspondence from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. That correspondence instructs a so-called Independent Member of the House, Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae, not to proceed with Committee Stage of a Bill that passed Second Stage unanimously in this House last December. On the Order of Business tomorrow, will the Taoiseach accept motion No. 131 on yesterday's Order Paper, that would end forever the corrupting of the political process in this country by the extension of the continued funding of political parties by corporate donations? Has the Taoiseach learned anything from the tribunals in relation to this matter? Does the Tánaiste still go along with corporate donations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Quinn is serious about this matter. He usually is, so I assume that is the case. If so, I would ask him to reconsider why he refused last Easter to join with other parties in examining these issues so that all of them could be dealt with. At that time Fine Gael was prepared to do so, as were other Opposition parties. I tried to bring that about and Deputy Quinn and I had continual correspondence about it so that we could perhaps deal with those issues. As the Deputy knows, I said at the time that for constitutional and legal reasons it was not so simple. I cited what the Honourable Mr. Justice Brian McCracken had said in the conclusion of his findings. He said that the tribunal did not consider it practical to prohibit all political contributions and rely solely on public funding of political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To do so might give rise to serious constitutional difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at that time that we were going ahead with the public office commission legislation and the Electoral Act, and that there were issues to be dealt with. I note again that Deputy Quinn will not answer my question. When he mentions the pollution of corporate donations, as if every business person in this country was corrupt, he does not go on to explain what exactly corporate funding is. Does it incorporate companies, partnerships or wealthy individuals who could spend £20,000 or £30,000 out of their back pockets? I do not know any of those.</P>

      <P>If there is such a desire by anybody, and I think there is by some parties, I would again ask Deputy Quinn to join with the other parties. I cannot answer for Deputy Noonan but last year his party agreed to co-operate with that all-party committee. We could deal with this issue. If we are really worried about people being corrupted, both the Tánaiste and I are ready and willing to deal with these issues, <Col N="707" /> but we need other people to do so. We will not succeed in doing it by giving one liners on the Order of Business. The way to do it is by way of an all-party committee. Again I take the opportunity to say to Deputy Quinn that I am prepared to address the issues raised by the Honourable Mr. Justice Brian McCracken and the other advice given to me by the Attorney General, which he gave to Deputy Quinn the day of the meeting in my ante-room, and to try to deal with this issue. I am ready to do that at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has stated that he has received constitutional legal advice to the effect that it would be unconstitutional to ban corporate donations. The Labour Party is not proposing to ban all donations. That is quite clear. We are talking about corporate donations. The proposal from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is to put a limit of £20,000 on corporate donations.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach inquired from the Tánaiste if her party has moved position on this issue because there is an indication that it may have? Is there anything in his remarks to Deputy Quinn which would indicate that he is willing to engage in serious discussion which would arrive at a point where corporate donations from bodies as defined in a series of Companies Acts &ndash; so there is no problem with the definition &ndash; would be banned? The difficulty &ndash; the Taoiseach seems to misunderstand it &ndash; is that the public can no longer distinguish between clean money and dirty money, it is the perception rather than the reality and the Taoiseach must change it if he is to renew politics. In the first instance, it is the Taoiseach's job to restore democracy and renew politics. We are showing the Taoiseach how to do it and we are going to carry this case forward. It is a very serious issue.</P>

      <P>Last week on the Order of Business the Taoiseach informed my colleague, Deputy Sargent, that provision for a tax on plastic bags would be contained in the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill and not in the Finance Bill. On 5 October last year, the Taoiseach was quite explicit when he said that it would not require separate legislation. On 25 October last year, he repeated that assertion, saying that it would not require separate legislation, despite the fact I got a parliamentary reply from the Department of the Environment and Local Government informing me that it was drafting separate legislation. Why did the Taoiseach misinform the House? Why did I have to be thrown out of this House, quite unjustly, because I brought up this point? Does the Taoiseach still have confidence in the Minister for litter because the litter louts all over this country certainly have confidence in him?</P>

This convention was signed by Ireland in 1997 and four years have elapsed since then. Why do we drag our heels in relation to ratifying into domestic law protocols and agreements that we sign willy nilly? We are the first in the queue to sign up and the last to ratify.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Social partnership involving employers, employees and the Government has been the driving force of change in the workplace in recent years, although I appreciate a number of significant disputes have recently required attention. The social partnership process has been backed up by a well balanced mix of employment rights and labour legislation, which, together with measures designed to stimulate employment, provides an appropriate framework for the purpose of achieving an efficient and competitive business environment.</P>
      <P>Employment rights legislation covering a range of areas, such as conditions of employment, has an important role to play in promoting labour market stability and minimising conflict. In keeping with Ireland's voluntarist tradition, collective agreements are generally the primary method of determining conditions of employment. The role of statute law has generally been limited to that of setting minimum levels of protection or entitlement.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 or 30 years Ireland has been to the forefront in ensuring that reasonable conditions of employment exist which set out clearly for both employers and employees their respective entitlements. Successive Governments have enacted legislation in the area of employment rights reflecting changes in society and the work place at both national and international levels, through, for example, the transposition of EU directives and reflecting in domestic law the standard setting activities of the International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe. Such legislation has covered a wide range of areas including minimum notice and terms of employment; protection against unfair dismissal; payment of wages; organisation or working time; safeguarding of employees' rights on the transfer of undertakings; protection of young persons at work; safety, health and welfare; redundancy entitlements; and minimum wage entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisation of working time is an area where employment rights legislation has dramatically affected people's work and lifestyles. This area covers issues such as holiday entitlements, rest periods, maximum working time and night work. For example, 100 years ago people were primarily concerned with the industrial rev<Col N="718" /> olution, especially the mechanisation of industry. Scientific and technological advances have in the interim greatly improved how we work while at the same time changing social needs and demands have influenced the length of time in terms of days and hours per week spent in the work place. In the 1930s the State set the maximum number of hours per week people worked, at 55 hours. This has been reduced over the years and in 1997 the Organisation of Working Time Act, which implemented EU Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993, set the maximum number of hours that may be worked in a week at 48.</P>
    <P>All of these changes in employment rights legislation have also influenced employment trends and the numbers in employment, which have risen from 1.22 million in 1994 to 1.67 million today, an increase of one third. Part of this number includes 281,000 part-time workers. This represents 17% of the work force, with the majority being women. In 1997 women accounted for more than three quarters of all part-time workers and the incidence of part-time working among women increased from 16% of all women at work in 1983 to 23% in 1997. The numbers of part-time workers are expected to rise in the coming years and estimates suggest that for Ireland these figures could be as high as 500,000 by 2005.</P>
    <P>The growth in part-time employment in the EU has continued up to 1998, the latest figures available. Total numbers of part-time workers in the EU have risen by an average of 14% overall during the period 1994-98, with 6% of men in employment and approximately 33% of women working part-time. However, these figures vary greatly from country to country. In the Netherlands the figure was 39% in 1998 while it was 6% in Greece, these being at the higher and lower ends of the scale respectively.</P>
    <P>Despite the welcome trend in Ireland the economy is experiencing severe skills shortages. This is happening across Europe and to address this major problem the European Commission and the Council of Ministers have since 1998 and under the Luxembourg Process, each year requested member states to prepare an employment action plan setting out their respective Governments' proposals on how to improve the overall economic environment in terms of people at work. As part of this process member states' respective annual employment action plans are required to set out policies which, <i>inter alia,</i> facilitate opportunities for women who have raised their families and are keen to return to the work place, and formulate family friendly policies which facilitate, in particular, greater female participation in the work force. The European Commission guidelines for 2001, the fourth year of this process, set out a number of horizontal objectives aimed at building conditions for full employment in a knowledge based society. These detailed guidelines require member states to formulate policies involving a more employment friendly approach through a review, where necessary, of benefits, taxes and training systems and positive <Col N="719" /> measures to maintain the skills and working capacity of older workers in particular, through sufficient access to education and training and flexible working conditions, such as part-time work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taxation system, the Government has in recent budgets substantially reduced the burden on the PAYE sector, thereby making the option of working more attractive. Furthermore, the Government, recognising the need for improved family friendly policies, introduced a series of initiatives, including the extension of paid maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks and unpaid maternity leave from four to eight weeks, announced in last December's budget. Last July the Government also increased parental leave. Last week I moved the Second Stage of the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000, which provides for up to 65 weeks unpaid leave from employment to care for persons requiring full-time care and attention. This social legislation is a first for Europe and I expect its early passage through the House in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>With regard to developing policies to facilitate older workers, recent research indicates, for example, that by 2020 the numbers of people in Ireland aged 65 and over will be approximately 700,000. At a recent conference held under the auspices of the Swedish EU Presidency, entitled Work Life, 2000 &ndash; Quality of Work, a number of speakers highlighted the need for Governments across Europe to fill job shortages through innovative policies which would involve people working beyond the current retirement age of 65 on a part-time basis. In this connection three types of measure have been introduced in some member states in recent years to reduce the extent of early retirement and to encourage people to remain longer in work. These include increasing the official age of retirement or eligibility to a full pension; the introduction of partial retirement schemes which enable older employees to work part-time while receiving a partial pension and so withdraw gradually from employment; and the provision of incentives to encourage businesses to retain older employees in work for longer.</P>
    <P>The scenario I have just painted set us all both a challenge and an opportunity. In this context the timing of our discussion on this Bill is, therefore, opportune. The Bill seeks to implement the provision of EU Directive 97/81/EC of the Council of the European Union concerning the Framework Agreement on Part Time Work concluded by the general cross-industry organisations at European level &ndash; the UNICE, the Union of Industrial Employers Confederations of Europe, the CEEP, the European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation, and the ETUC, the European Trade Union Confederation. The directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 15 December 1997 and was to have been implemented in member states not later than 20 January 2000. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment notified the European Commission of the intention to postpone the <Col N="720" /> implementation date by up to one year, that is, 20 January 2001, as allowed for by the directive, to take account of special difficulties.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the directive are to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers, to improve the quality of part-time work, to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and workers. A tripartite working group, including representatives from the social partners, IBEC and the ICTU, and relevant Departments, the Departments of Finance, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, was established to discuss the measures necessary for the implementation of the directive in this country. The deliberations of the group have contributed to and influenced the composition of the Bill. I thank ICTU and IBEC for their work at European and national level in framing the Bill, which will have a major social impact in Ireland in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The scope of the directive is expressed as applying to part-time workers who have an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by the law, collective agreement or practice in force in each member state. In this context, Irish labour law covers persons employed under contracts of service and agency workers. The directive provides that, after consultation with the social partners, member states may, for objective reasons, provide for the exclusion wholly or partly from the proposals of part-time workers who work on a casual basis. The directive requires the implementation in member states of measures guaranteeing that part-time workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers. It also requires the removal of discrimination against part-time workers where such exists and contains measures aimed at improving the quality of part-time work.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are influenced by the terms of the directive. In addition, we have had detailed discussions with the social partners, ICTU and IBEC, and both support the intent of the Bill. ICTU and IBEC have both raised a number of issues, mainly of a technical nature, which are being considered and which we can discuss further in committee. In this context, I would like to mention specifically the pension entitlements of part-time workers. The Bill honours the Government's commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the definition of remuneration in the Bill would include occupational pensions. However, in terms of practicality, section 9(4) provides that, in so far as it relates to a scheme or arrangement, the entitlement of a part-time employee under section 9(1), that is, not to be treated in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee, shall apply only to such part-time employees who normally work more than eight hours in a week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> I will outline in detail the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision dealing with the short title, collective citation and construction of the Bill. Section 2 provides that the Bill will come into operation on a day or days to be prescribed. Section 3 sets down the main definitions associated with the Bill. Section 4 empowers the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make regulations and orders prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in the Bill as prescribed or to be prescribed or for the purpose of enabling any provision of the Bill to have full effect. Section 5 repeals the Worker Protection (Regulator Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991. Section 6 is a standard provision in legislation stating that the expenses incurred by the Minister in connection with the administration of the Bill shall be paid out of money provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the definitions associated with Part 2 of the Bill. Section 8 provides that each relevant enactment, as defined in section 3, shall apply to a part-time employee in the same way as it applies, other than by virtue of the Bill, to an employee to whom that enactment relates. Section 9 provides that, generally, a part-time employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee in respect of his or her conditions of employment. Section 9(2), however, provides that a part-time employee may, in respect of a particular condition of employment, be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee provided that treatment is based on objective grounds. Also, section 9(4) provides that a part-time employee who normally works less than 8 hours per week may be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee in relation to pensions.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that a benefit accorded to a part-time employee under section 9(1) shall be on the basis of the principle of <i>pro rata temporis,</i> that is, shall be related to the proportion which the normal hours of work of that employee bears to the normal hours of work of the full-time comparator concerned. Section 11 provides that a part-time employee who works on a casual basis, as defined in the section, may be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee if objective grounds exist to justify such less favourable treatment. Section 11(6) provides that the Minister shall, from time to time, review the operation of this section and may, following such a review, prescribe a class or classes of such employee to be a class or classes of employees to whom this section shall not apply.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that a ground for treating an employee less favourably shall not be regarded as an objective ground for that purpose unless it is based on considerations other than the part-time status of the employee. The less favourable treatment involved for the employee must be for the purpose of achieving a legitimate objective of the employer, and such treatment must be appropriate and necessary for that purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> Section 13 provides that the Labour Relations Commission may, and at the request of the Minister, in order to identify obstacles to a person being able to perform part-time work, study every industry and sector of employment and make recommendations as to how obstacles identified in such study could be eliminated. The commission shall report to the Minister on any study and shall publish such study and recommendations. Section 13(4) provides that, in drawing up recommendations, the commission shall invite oral or written submissions from appropriate organisations representative of employers and employees and shall take account of such submissions in preparing its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that a provision in any employment agreement shall be void in so far as it is inconsistent with any provision of the Bill. Section 15 provides that an employer shall not penalise an employee for having lawfully opposed an Act which is unlawful under this Bill. Section 15(2) states that penalisation for this purpose includes dismissal, unfavourable change in conditions of employment or any unfair treatment, including selection for redundancy. An employee may now seek relief against such penalisation under this Bill and under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that a complaint by an employee, or by a trade union of which the employee is a member, that the employer has contravened sections 9 or 15 of the Bill in relation to that employee, may be presented to a rights commissioner. The rights commissioner shall issue a written decision in the matter and communicate that decision to the parties. The decision of the rights commissioner may require the employer to pay compensation, subject to a limit of two years of the employee's remuneration. A complaint to a rights commissioner must be made within six months of the date of contravention of the Bill. This period may be extended by a further 12 months if the commissioner is satisfied that failure to refer the case within six months was due to reasonable cause. The hearing before the rights commissioner shall be conducted in private.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that a decision of a rights commissioner may be appealed to the Labour Court within six weeks of the date of the decision. The Labour Court shall issue a determination in writing affirming, varying or setting aside the decision of the rights commissioner. The Labour Court may request the Minister to refer a question of law arising in proceedings before it under this section to the High Court for final and conclusive determination. Where a decision of the rights commissioner has not been carried out by the employer, and an appeal against the decision has not been brought within the time allowed for doing so, the employee may, within six weeks after the expiry of that time, refer the complaint to the Labour Court and the Labour Court shall, without hearing any evidence, make a determi<Col N="723" /> nation to the like effect as the decision of the rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that, where an employer fails to implement a determination of the Labour Court within six weeks from the date it is communicated to the parties and the determination has not been appealed within the appropriate time limit, the Circuit Court shall, on application to it by the employee concerned, a trade union of which the employee is a member, or the Minister, and without hearing any evidence, make an order directing the employer to implement the determination.</P>
    <P>Section 19, relating to prosecution, is a technical section relating to the evidence of a person's failure to attend before, to give evidence or to produce documents to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Section 20 confirms that Irish employee protection legislation conforms to the requirements of Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. In this regard, the section provides that a range of employee protection legislation applies to workers posted to work in this country, both within the meaning of the directive and otherwise, in exactly the same way as it applies to Irish workers covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for an amendment of section 14(2) of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 &ndash; relating to collective redundancies &ndash; to increase the amount of the fine provided for therein from £3,000 to £10,000 in regard to an indictable offence.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for labour affairs, I am satisfied that the right to reasonable conditions of employment should and will continue to be enshrined in employment rights legislation. It is our duty as elected and accountable legislators to play a proactive approach in ensuring any such future legislation reflects the needs and expectations of both employers and employees, is framed in such a way as to respond to the needs of society as a whole and reflects the ongoing changes taking place at an enormous pace in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000 is, without doubt, a major change in our employment rights legislation and will change the employment landscape in the years ahead. There is an obligation on us as legislators to move ahead with its swift passage through the Houses. Right now there are some 270,000 part-time employees waiting for its enactment so that they can continue to work in the knowledge that they now, for the first time, will have statutory entitlements which will facilitate their continuation in employment and encourage even higher numbers of part-time workers onto the labour market in the years ahead, for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is strong evidence that part-time work will become more common in the years <Col N="724" /> ahead. Some of the figures I outlined, particularly in relation to older people returning to the workforce, are revealing. There has been much debate about our role in Europe but in this regard we are in tandem with Europe. I regularly attend the Social Affairs Council and I am conscious of the strong influence Europe has on Ireland in this area. It is a positive influence and is in accord with the way Ireland is developing.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be able to bring forward this legislation. I explained in my replies to various parliamentary questions the reasons for some of the delays. There are also issues my colleagues in the House will be anxious to deal with on Second and Committee Stages and I will be happy to listen to their contributions. I commend the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction, at last, of this Bill. It affords Members an opportunity to address some of the issues in relation to part-time workers. These workers have been largely ignored in the past but they will become more important in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The Irish business sector has undergone a remarkable transformation in the 1990s. Private sector non-agricultural employment has increased by 400,000 or by more than 50% in the last decade. Almost 80% of employment growth has come from indigenously owned companies in the manufacturing or services sectors. In the more open global marketplace where Ireland must now compete, competitiveness will be more important than ever. We must protect the competitive strengths we have carefully built.</P>
      <P>Despite our economic success, Ireland still exhibits certain structural weaknesses. To succeed a small open economy must be more nimble than its competitors. It must anticipate and master change and build on its long-term competitiveness on the basis of high skills, innovation, quality and flexibility. This is the route to high paid employment which Ireland must take.</P>
      <P>The Government failed to meet its commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to give 270,000 part-time workers new rights to pensions, holidays and other entitlements. This legislation was due to be presented in June but is only now before the House. Part-time workers, as a consequence, have lost 12 months' pension entitlements, pay and so forth. Sadly, the Minister did not mention the issue of retrospective pay and entitlements for the workers who missed out due to the 12 month delay in introducing this legislation. I hope the Minister will give a commitment that at least the Government Departments that employ part-time workers will make up those contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was obliged to implement the 1997 EU Council directive on part-time working by 20 January 2000 but received a derogation until 20 January this year. During the negotiations on PPF, commitments were given that the Bill would be before the Oireachtas no later than <Col N="725" /> last June. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, gave a number of commitments that the legislation would become law by 20 January this year, the final deadline permitted by the European Commission. Alas, the standard practice of this Government, to drag its heels on vital legislation, is again evident.</P>
    <P>This Bill will replace the 1990 legislation under which part-time employees had to work at least eight hours per week for 13 weeks to be eligible for protection. Only a fraction of part-time employees, therefore, benefited from it. The new Bill is expected to cover most of the 280,600 people classified as part-time workers as it provides for no hourly or weekly threshold except in regard to pension entitlements. When it becomes law it will entitle part-time workers to occupational pensions, holiday pay, sick leave and other benefits on the same basis as full-time employees. They will also be covered by unfair dismissals, minimum notice and redundancy legislation.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 the ratio of part-time workers has increased from one in 15 of the workforce to one in eight. Furthermore, a recent study shows most employees are working fewer hours than before. Over the past 17 years, the average working week in Ireland has fallen from 44 hours per week to 38. The study found most full-time workers want to shorten full-time weeks and most part-time workers want to work longer part-time weeks. While the debate to date has been about women's labour force participation becoming closer to that of men, it would be more accurate now to see women as leading the way towards a greater fragmentation of the time structure of all those at work.</P>
    <P>Labour shortages are one of the greatest current threats to the continued prosperity of many businesses. Firms are now reporting vacancy rates approaching 10% across all grades. The tightest grade is computer professionals where more than 15% vacancies are recorded. New forms of flexible employment relationships, particularly part-time work, are becoming increasingly important to the Irish labour market to provide for the consolidation and expansion of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Arrangements regarding employment and social insurance legislation have failed to keep in step with this development, since the organisation of such arrangements continues to be based on open ended, full-time employment relationships as the norm. That is far from the reality of employment in Ireland today. Part-time workers are discriminated against by comparison to full-time workers with open ended contracts in respect of terms of employment, such as protection against dismissal, paid annual leave, continuation of pay in the event of sickness, parental leave, vocational training and so forth, and in respect of social insurance, such as unemployment, pension and sickness insurance.</P>
    <P>This is further compounded by the fact that more than 80% of part-time workers are women and that this legislation does not contribute to <Col N="726" /> making part-time work more attractive. The Minister referred to the European Commission guidelines for 2001 which state that a more employment friendly approach with necessary benefits in tax, training and so forth was needed. However, he made no further mention of the matter. Perhaps he will deal with that in his reply and enlighten the House on the discussions he has had with ICTU and IBEC in that regard. This legislation sets a minimum, not a maximum, standard but many employers could see it as a maximum target. If that is the case our economy will groan due to the lack of staff to fill the labour shortages. While the Bill will guarantee that part-time workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers, employers will, in order to fill vacant posts, have to treat part-time workers more favourably than set out in this legal requirement.</P>
    <P>We must introduce targeted measures for women in employment in the areas of training and equal pay for equal work. A large number of women &ndash; 32% of the female workforce &ndash; are in atypical or casual work and there is a need for practical measures to bring this division in the labour market to an end. Efforts should also be made to create more part-time jobs covered by social contributions, offering women both social security and the possibility of combining employment with child rearing. This requires measures to facilitate the reintegration of women into working life and measures designed to make family life and work more compatible.</P>
    <P>For my generation the debate is about equity, fair play for all and how we use the wealth we have created in the interest of all our people. The most successful economies are ones that are competitive and have flexible labour markets. Fine Gael aims to support the role of women both in the home and in the workplace. We will not support policies that seek to conscript women into the labour force, as this Government does with the introduction of individualisation. We will respect the choice of individual women to work in or outside the home. Depending on family circumstances, the choice to work within the home or outside of it must be reversible. While female participation rates in the work force have increased dramatically, the failure to develop an adequate public child care policy has made it difficult for many women to participate. It is estimated that child care costs in Ireland represent 20% of average earnings compared to 8% in the rest of Europe. In many cases, both parents work outside the home as the prohibitive cost of housing leaves them no other choice. Of the mothers of younger children, 42% are in employment. For working parents, the stress of rearing a child commences within weeks of its birth when maternity or paternity leave ends.</P>
    <P>It is now almost impossible to obtain quality child care at an affordable price in many areas. The implementation of health board regulations has already resulted in the loss of at least 4,000 child care places nationally. The quality of child <Col N="727" /> care is an increasing concern for parents. Existing regulations concentrate on the physical features and staff ratios of child care facilities. Greater attention must be given to improving the quality of child care provision. This must not be achieved by setting rigid qualification requirements, as these will only drive out existing providers, but through the provision of access to support and training for child care providers through local networks.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes five key steps &ndash; two local and three national &ndash; which must be taken in the area of child care provision. Local authority planning guidelines should facilitate the provision of child care in residential areas. It is wrong for planning authorities to insist that a house in a residential area cannot be used as a crèche for children in the immediate locality. Unused primary school rooms should be franchised for the purposes of child care provision in after-school hours. Child benefit payments should be significantly increased for children under five years of age and a smaller increase should be provided in regard to children between five and ten years. That would guarantee the equal treatment of all children, be they in receipt of paid child care or care in the home by a parent, grandparent or relative. Paid child care should not be a privilege over unpaid child care or <i>vice versa.</i> Individual families should have the resources to make their own choices.</P>
    <P>Additional mortgage relief up to £500 per child should be provided to reflect that a child takes up as much housing space as its parents, space which is becoming increasingly expensive. Extra mortgage relief would increase the disposable income of families on whom mortgage and child care costs are a heavy burden. A proper capitation system for child care providers, placing special emphasis on low income families, should be introduced. Payments of the order of £10 per week must be considered if we are to have a range of quality child care services.</P>
    <P>To date, part-time workers have been excluded from company pension schemes. This legislation will entitle them to the same provisions as full-time workers, once they work more than eight hours. However, the legislation is not retrospective, a fact the Minister failed to mention in the course of his speech. Will the Minister enlighten us on the implications of a recent ruling from the European Court of Justice which may entitle part-time workers to backdate their pension rights to 1976? In the British Preston case, part-time workers were discriminated against on gender grounds by not being allowed to join their employer's pension scheme. Only full-time employees were eligible to join and most of the part-time workers were female and most of the full-time workers were male. Therefore, the full-time requirement indirectly discriminated against part-time workers. How will such developments in European equality law on part-time workers impact here and will these developments need to <Col N="728" /> be tested in Irish courts before the rights of Irish workers are clarified? The Minister will be aware that pension litigation is quite rare in this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the issue of pensions in his speech and pointed out that some European countries have raised the official retirement age for eligibility for full pensions. In some of these countries, people over 65 years of age can remain in full-time or part-time employment and receive a partial pension. Does the Government intend to introduce similar measures here and, if so, does it intend to inform pensioners or those approaching pension age of its objectives? This is a fundamental question which the Minister must address.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of an occupational or non-contributory old age pension experience a sizeable drop in income on leaving employment. Many elderly people would welcome the opportunity to work part time. Some of them need to work to subsidise their pension payments. The Minister seems to be indicating that such people will be penalised. They will not be able to avail of their occupational pensions at 65 years of age and, even if they can, they will not be able to subsidise their pension payments because they will be subject to a claw-back if they take up part-time work.</P>
    <P>Early retirement pensions have created obstacles to people who wish to return to the work force. Nurses, particularly psychiatric nurses, availed of early retirement and were prevented from returning to the system. The Western Health Board cannot get sufficient psychiatric nurses for some of its services, yet such staff were offered early retirement as recently as five years ago. The nurses are willing to return to the work force but the legislation is putting obstacles in their path. Does the Minister propose to create further barriers in this area through a claw-back provision rather than encourage people to return to work? That is what I understand from his speech.</P>
    <P>An increased age limit on pensions will not increase flexibility in the area of employment. People in their late fifties and early sixties are crossing off the days until they can get out of the rut in which they find themselves. These people may have experience to offer to other employers if they could avail of part-time employment and receive their occupational pensions. It is important that the Minister clarifies his position on this matter. I know many people in receipt of occupational pensions who are returning to the work force with a heart and a half&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy but I would be happy to clarify my position. The message I sought to convey was that I favoured older people returning to the work force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not indicated in the Minister's speech and I would welcome further <Col N="729" /> clarification on this issue which is of concern to many people.</P>
      <P>I would also like the Minister to address the treatment of substitute teachers. Temporary and qualified teachers perform the same duties as their permanent counterparts yet there is a discrepancy in the remuneration paid. Will the Bill resolve that? Furthermore, what impact will this legislation have on the so-called unqualified substitute teachers? Many of them have the same qualifications, and some are even more qualified, than their counterparts in full-time employment in the teaching profession but because they do not have the required Irish, they are severely discriminated against in terms of remuneration, earning just over half the salary of those doing the same job but who have Irish. Will that be defined as objective grounds under this legislation?</P>
      <P>While in general terms these measures will be welcomed by the farming community, where part-time work helps to support small holdings, serious implications arise from part-time work which should be brought to the attention of both the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the European Commission. The main one is the exclusion from certain EU sponsored schemes, for example, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development debars applicants from the EU's early retirement scheme if they are found to be engaged in part-time work for a period prior to their application. At the same time the Commission, through this directive, is attaching great significance to the need for proper provision of social security and pensions for part-time workers. This seems to be a contradiction in terms in relation to pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>Those farmers with holdings of 15 or 16 hectares who simply must supplement their incomes with off-farm work in order to survive are currently being discriminated against. Surely it was to these farmers that schemes such as the early retirement scheme were directed. Furthermore, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development excludes these part-time workers from certain premium payments by making an assessment against them of their off-farm income. I hope the Minister will address that issue also in his response because on the one hand the EU is talking about promoting part-time work while on the other, through its arm in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, it is discriminating against part-time workers. As the Minister knows, coming from the west, many of the holdings are not viable. A farmer, especially under the current regime, cannot survive in agriculture and farmers need to supplement their incomes through part-time work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also hope this legislation will now support home helps who have been a key element in the provision of services to the elderly in the community. These people have been blatantly discriminated against in the past and I hope that not only will the Department of Health and Children <Col N="730" /> fulfil the legislative requirements immediately but that it will make provision for the back payment of moneys to this vital sector of our health services.</P>
    <P>Last night and tonight we debate the issue of the scandal surrounding the nursing home subventions. There is a similar scandal in relation to home helps. We have talked about the abuse of part-time workers here in the past and this legislation is to protect their rights. However, one of the biggest culprits involved in the abuse of part-time workers has been the Department of Health and Children in relation to home helps and I hope it will now give a commitment to repay those moneys and ensure that their rights are protected and that those people are encouraged to stay in that sector.</P>
    <P>With regard to sections 9 and 12, will the Minister elaborate on the type of objective grounds which would debar part-time workers from being treated as favourably as their full-time colleagues? Section 9(2) provides for such discrimination on objective grounds but the Minister in his contribution did not outline those objective grounds or give an example of what we are talking about. Is it the case that the example I have already given in relation to substitute teachers will be considered objective grounds, where people are doing the same hours and the same work but because they are not full-time or permanent employees they are being discriminated against and paid, on an hourly rate, much less than their full-time or permanent colleagues? Is that the type of objective grounds we are talking about? Is section 9(2) a loophole for the Government to get out of paying people their just entitlements? Will the same thing happen in relation to home helps? Will they be left behind because of this clause in section 9(2), and the same issue is addressed in section 12 in relation to causal work? That issue should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Will these objective grounds discriminate against part-time farmers? I want to make sure that we do not leave loopholes in this legislation so that Departments can continue to ignore the rights of part-time workers. I want a commitment from the Minister of State today that that will not happen in relation to this section because it is futile for us to come in here and talk about protecting the rights of part-time workers if an opt-out clause is left in the legislation for various Departments, some of the major employers in the country, to avoid paying part-time workers their full entitlements.</P>
    <P>Section 20 protects the rights of posted or contract workers in employment outside Ireland and foreign workers posted in Ireland. Will the Minister expand on this section to specifically deal with the abuse of foreign workers on work permits in Ireland? I welcome section 20, which will protect the rights of Irish workers doing posted or contract work abroad, but I will make one point in relation to that. If the going rate for a tradesman here is £500 a week and we bring in German employees or people from anywhere else <Col N="731" /> in the EU or outside it to deliver on our national development plan, where the going rate is £600 or £700 per week, what will happen in that situation? They are guaranteed £500 but they will not come to Ireland for £500 per week if they can get £600 or £700 per week working in Dusseldorf. I would like the Minister to address that point.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the issue of work permits, I have raised in the House on a number of occasions media reports that eastern Europeans are being paid less than the minimum wage in a company in the midlands, that a Filipino national was threatened with deportation because she worked a day and a night shift for 18 hours without any meal breaks and that six nurses coming here had their contracts changed on arrival. A further report was of an Irish-based agent who is an employee of a semi-State company and who charges a 10% fee on individual Romanian salaries. Sixty people are under such a contract. I was amazed that when these reports were published in the media, the individual involved who works in a semi-State company had no problem admitting that he was charging this 10% levy, which is totally contrary to the 1971 Employment Agency Act. I would be surprised if this individual is even registered with the Department under the Employment Agency Act.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can enlighten us on the types of investigations that have taken place in this area. He has said that he is reviewing the legislation. There is no question that there are loopholes in it in regard to people who come to this country being abused by citizens or residents of this State. I fully accept it is more complex in terms of the country of origin, but we have a certain amount of control in relation to problems which arise here and in fairness we should deal with them. I know the Minister is dealing with other issues &ndash; it is a complex matter and I fully support him. What investigations are taking place and what progress has been made on these matters? The only way employers and employment agencies will change their ways is if these investigations are conducted and prosecutions take place.</P>
    <P>What progress is being made in the departmental investigation into the sale of work permits for £6,000? It is claimed that a group of businessmen involved has secured dozens of work permits. This is a fundamental issue which questions the integrity of the entire work permit system and of the staff working in that section. The investigation should be completed as soon as possible and the results published for the sake of those staff who are doing a very difficult job under huge pressure.</P>

      <P>A year later the Government enacted the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, which provided certain minimum conditions for part-time workers. Therefore, I am well disposed towards this Bill and entirely accept the Minister's unscripted remarks. At the end of his speech the Minister referred to the positive influence the EU has had on matters such as our employment law and social change in general, saying this Bill derives from that same force and that he thinks that force is positive, as I do. Certainly one can see its influence on the character of this Bill. I do not know why the Minister chose those few remarks for his unscripted contribution because that is not the view of his senior Minister, the Tánaiste, who takes a different view on the influence of Europe. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to the ranks of the Berlin as compared to the Boston quartet, but the Tánaiste is very firmly in the Boston camp. I presume there was a purpose in the Minister of State sending out a signal today that he lines up with the Berlin social contract approach.</P>

      <P>He is correct in that Europe has had a considerable, positive influence on our social legislation and employment law dating back to the 1970s, and this Bill is in keeping with that tradition.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech traced the fact that part-time or atypical working is a growing phenomenon in society. It could be summarised in terms of the more developed the economy, the more we find the existence of part-time or atypical working. If memory serves, the Minister in his speech compared the Netherlands, for example, with Greece, which tends to bear out this conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister are very interesting, including the fact that as recently as 1997 there were fewer than 170,000 part-time workers in the workforce while three years later this had increased to 280,000. Notwithstanding the expansion in employment in recent years, that is a fairly rapid acceleration in the rate of take-up of part-time or atypical employment. There is no reason this will not continue to accelerate as there have been dramatic changes in society and a dramatic increase in the participation levels by women, for example, in the workforce. Matters which caused us great angst only a few short years ago, such as Sunday trading, have now come to be accepted phenomena. Perhaps there were people in all parties who agonised as to whether Sunday trading was desirable for society, depending on whether one fell into the Sabbatarian camp or otherwise. If it was the last option on earth open to me I would not engage in shopping on Sundays &ndash; I do not engage in it any day of the week. However, the majority in society now engage in shopping on Sunday, and it is clear <Col N="733" /> that section of business could not function without part-time workers.</P>
    <P>In the years ahead it is likely part-time working will prove an accelerating phenomenon. Where within the State will the additional labour come from to fill our skills shortage? It seems there are a number of very limited possibilities, one being women in the home who have skills and who left the workplace because of the obligations and responsibilities of raising children, which are taken on not exclusively but predominantly by women. Those women have acquired significant skills and retraining, if necessary, would be a very brief exercise. Given family friendly workplaces, more women would return to the workforce, and that is one area towards which the Bill is directed, though we still have a long way to go. For example, Deputy Naughten dealt with child care and he is correct in what he said. Parents are immensely concerned about the quality, and the absence, of child care facilities. Women working part-time is likely, therefore, to be an area of continued expansion and will be a source of domestic labour which is necessary to the economy.</P>
    <P>Another area where we can find domestic labour is older people. No more than lifelong learning, the notion of having to quit one's job at 60 or even 65 years of age is not necessarily absolute. If the workplace arrangements are flexible, older people with immense experience can be induced to return to the workforce in circumstances which suit them.</P>
    <P>There are areas of acute need in some professions. Deputy Naughten dealt with nursing, for example. It is incumbent upon us to facilitate, even if only for one night a week, the re-entry of nurses who have acquired valuable skills and who, because of child and family responsibilities, cannot return to the hospital service. It is happening in the teaching area. In the teaching area, it is quite common that teachers contribute what are described as part-time hours. In that regard, I am disappointed that the Minister has gone out of his way in the Bill in section 9(4)&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the face of it, people listening to this debate at 2.15 a.m. tomorrow morning when RTE broadcasts it may ask why I complain about people on eight hours not getting a pension. If one examines this, one sees that for instance the Teachers' Union of Ireland would consider eight hours to be a significant teaching burden for a part-time worker. There are many people in universities who do not teach for 16 hours per week. They teach for considerably less, so eight hours is a significant complement of teaching hours. To remove the entitlement of those people to pensions is wrong. Will the Minister of State think about it again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. If we must leave in some kind of threshold it would be better to express it as a proportion or a percentage. If one works in the normal 40 hour week workplace environment, eight hours may seem to be a low threshold and it would only be a fraction of the normal working week. However, in an area like teaching, if it was expressed as a proportion, it would bring teachers over that threshold and that would be a positive contribution.</P>
      <P>From time to time, a Bill comes before this House, whose language is incapable of penetration. Such a Bill has now come before the House. I have no idea why it is necessary to present a not too complex issue in such impenetrable, opaque, obtuse language. This beats all, in terms of the unfortunate people who might be expected to benefit from it.</P>
      <P>For example, to examine something as fundamental to the Bill as the definition of part-time worker, &ldquo;part-time employee&rdquo; according to section 7, means &ldquo;an employee whose normal hours of work are less than the normal hours of work of an employee who is a comparable employee in relation to him or her.&rdquo;  What does that mean?</P>
      <P>It defines that &ldquo;comparable employee&rdquo; shall be construed in accordance with subsection (2);&rdquo;. Subsection (2) is utterly incapable of understanding. What is a &ldquo;comparable employee&rdquo;? For example, subsection (2) states &ldquo;For the purposes of this Part, an employee is a comparable employee in relation to the employee firstly mentioned in the definition of &ldquo;part-time employee&rdquo; in this section (the &ldquo;first mentioned employee&rdquo;) if&ndash;&rdquo; paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are there. Paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are similarly circular and difficult in the language.</P>
      <P>The learned lawyers and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government have good reasons for many of these things but this is as difficult a Bill in that sense as one would meet in a long day. The persistent use of double negatives throughout, the use of circular language that brings one back to where one was before and so on, makes it a very difficult area.</P>
      <P>In terms of the definition of a casual employee, for example, he or she is defined as a person who works on a casual basis and does not fall within a class of employee prescribed under subsection (6). Section 11 (2) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding <i>section 9</i><i>(1),</i> a part-time employee to whom this section applies may, if such less favourable treatment can be justified on objective grounds, be treated, in respect of a particular condition of employment, in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no definition in the Bill of a &ldquo;comparable full-time employee&rdquo;. There is no such thing <Col N="735" /> in the Bill. There is a &ldquo;comparable employee&rdquo; and a &ldquo;part-time employee&rdquo;. There is no such thing as a comparable, full-time employee.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Naughten said, I hope much of this is not for the purpose of providing loop-holes and escape hatches for when the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the commitment the Minister of State has given to produce intelligible brochures or leaflets for trade union officials and others that will be concerned with this, explaining what these circular terms mean. Certainly, in so far as the transposition of Directives of European Union law into Irish law is supposed to pass the intelligible language test, this does not and on occasions the language is so circular to make it difficult to define what is intended by it.</P>
      <P>It is not accessible to the majority of employees who are likely to benefit from it. That the Minister uses this circular language, which departs, for example, from the definitions used in the Directive, makes it more difficult. For example, a &ldquo;full-time employee&rdquo; in the Bill means an employee &ldquo;who is not a part-time employee&rdquo; and a &ldquo;part-time employee&rdquo; is someone &ldquo;whose normal hours of work are less than the normal hours of work of a comparable employee&rdquo; who, in turn, is only defined in terms of his relationship with the part-time employee. This kind of definition succeeds only in bringing us around in circles.</P>
      <P>The Bill appears to create three classes of part-time worker &ndash; first, a class of part-time employee who cannot be treated less favourably or discriminated against, second, a class of part-time employee, against whom the employer may discriminate in certain circumstances and third a class of casual part-time worker who would appear to have no rights under the Bill. Since the Bill purports to repeal the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, it is not clear whether there is any class of worker who had some entitlements under that Act and who now loses those entitlements. I hope the Minister of State can say there is no such class of worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11, for example, differentiates between a &ldquo;part-time worker&rdquo; and a part-time worker who works on a casual basis, although the difference between the two is not clearly set out. Section 11 (3) seems to state that part-time employees who work on a casual basis are still entitled to the protection of employment legislation, that is, the relevant enactments. Does this mean that part-time employees who may be described as regular part-time employees and part-time employees who <Col N="736" /> work on a casual basis have the same entitlements in terms of the existing employment legislation?</P>
    <P>For example, if I work four hours per week for one year, I should now have the protection of the unfair dismissals legislation. However, if I work for 15 hours most weeks in the same year but am not offered any hours of work during some weeks of that period, am I still protected under the Unfair Dismissals Act even though my employment might be considered by my employer to be part-time on a casual basis?</P>
    <P>Section 11 attempts to define a part-time employee working on a casual basis. However, the following points seem to emerge. To be part-time on a casual basis the employee must have been in the continuous service of the employer for a period of less than 13 weeks. In addition, that period of service and any previous period of service with the same employer must not be of such a nature as may reasonably be regarded as regular or seasonal employment. Service is deemed to be continuous unless it is terminated by dismissal of the employee by the employer or by the resignation of the employee. People can be part-time employees working on a casual basis if they fulfil conditions specified in a collective agreement that applies to them and designates them as working on a casual basis. Presumably this will be a matter for trade unions and employers to agree on.</P>
    <P>These points serve more to provoke questions than to provide answers. Is it safe to presume that a part-time employee with 14 weeks' service cannot be considered to be working on a casual basis? What if that employee only worked 12 weeks during the 14 week period? Given that service is continuous unless broken by dismissal or termination, this would still appear to be 14 weeks' service. Do these provisions allow an employer to terminate employment after 12 weeks, rehire the same employee some weeks later and claim this part-time employee is working on a casual basis on the assertion that his or her employment is not regular or seasonal? </P>
    <P>These provisions do not appear to explain the position of the part-time employee who may not be offered work every week by the employer. If they have over 13 weeks' service they are not casual. If they have not been dismissed, their service is continuous even though there may be gaps in their employment. The question is whether a part-time employee who works on a sporadic basis would be entitled to bring, for example, an unfair dismissal claim if they have been in the job for over a year without being dismissed even though they may not have worked every week.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Minister and his officials a commentary on the Bill prepared by FLAC. It raises questions the answers to which are not clear from the legislation as it stands. These people work at the coal face in terms of welfare and employment rights in this area. They have a good deal of experience on the ground and made a valuable commentary on the Bill dealing with minimum pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> Section 13 seems to relate to clause 5 of the directive which is entitled &ldquo;Opportunities for Part-time Work&rdquo;. The Minister has omitted parts 2 and 3 of clause 5. I wonder why. Part 2 states that a worker's refusal to transfer from full-time to part-time work or <i>vice versa</i> should not in itself constitute a valid reason for termination of employment subject to national law and practice. In this respect given that in Irish employment and contract law, a contract cannot be unilaterally varied without consent, such a refusal should not be allowed to give rise to a valid termination of employment. However, part 3 appears to be the more serious omission. It requires that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time to part-time work that becomes available in the enterprise; requests by workers to transfer from part-time work to full-time work or to increase their working time should the opportunity arise; the provision of timely information on the availability of part-time and full-time positions in the establishment in order to facilitate transfers from full-time to part-time work and <i>vice versa</i>; and measures to facilitate access to part-time work at all levels of the enterprise, for example, the provision of appropriate information on part-time working in the enterprise to existing bodies representing workers.</P>
    <P>These are very important omissions. I have no idea why the Minister chose to exclude them. I do not differ with many of the sentiments he expressed but if he is serious about his aspirations towards a more flexible, family friendly workforce, why should he want to excise from the provisions of the directive the facility to transfer from part-time working to full-time working and <i>vice versa</i>? For example, one of the main purposes of those parts is to encourage job sharing. As I understand the thrust of the directive, where a suitable job sharing opportunity exists it requires the employer to facilitate that arrangement. We heard many fine words from the Minister and I do not impute any lack of genuineness to him. We heard about the nature of the modern workforce, the responsibilities of families, the duties of, most frequently, the mother and the desirability of increasing the rates of participation by women in the workforce. Yet a pivotal section of the directive that is designed to facilitate the transfer from full-time to part-time working and part-time to full-time working and facilitate job sharing is not in the legislation. I am sure the Minister will deal with that issue in his reply. There may be a good explanation but it escapes me. We should re-import that into the legislation as was intended. It would be in keeping with the Berlin as distinct from the Boston model and I know that recommends itself to Deputy Kitt even if he has difficulty in getting it past his senior Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that legislation was enacted in the 1930s to cap the working week at 55 hours. It is remarkable when you look at developments here over the past 20 years. A <Col N="738" /> number of experts wrote booklets explaining the difficulty we would have coping with our leisure time in 2000. We would be working four day weeks, just like journalists, and would find it difficult to fill our leisure time. It is remarkable that we work more hours now than we did 20 years ago. The advent of new technologies and the information age were supposed to bring about a situation where we could earn greater income for half the time at work. It has not turned out that way for a variety of reasons. Twenty years ago a great many clerical white collar employees worked a 35 hour week, whereas the trend has been the other way in recent times. When one takes into account the length of time it takes one to travel to and from work the working week is much longer now than it was then.</P>
    <P>This is an additional reason for us as a society and for those in charge of managing the economy to plan for the participation in the workforce of irregular, atypical and part-time working. We ought to do everything we can to facilitate these on a flexible basis. Therefore, the two parts of the directive not enshrined in the Bill ought to be brought on board.</P>
    <P>There are many other points I would like to make but time does not permit me to do so. Nevertheless I will have the opportunity to do so on Committee Stage. For example, the number of areas remitted to the rights commissioner is narrow. There are other matters the rights commissioner could reasonable be asked to adjudicate on. Congress raised a point about the provision under which workers shall not be treated less favourably as distinct from the directive which prohibits the less favourable treatment of workers. I will examine that nuance and a number of other points on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Last week we debated the legislation dealing with carer's leave, while prior to that we debated the minimum wage legislation. Tomorrow we will debate European directives and the impact they have had on domestic legislation. If Deputy Rabbitte is interested, I prefer Berlin to Boston for a range of reasons.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt that there has been a dramatic change in the profile of the workforce during the past number of years. I will not recite the statistics given by the Minister as we can see evidence of this all around us. The opportunities created by the Government have made it easier for workers to participate in the workforce at different levels. There has been a huge increase in the number of women who are opting to return to the workforce. They are doing this for a variety of reasons, for example, pure economic reasons, career reasons and self-development reasons. Many older people are remaining in the workforce. This is an issue I would like to return to. Younger people and students are entering the workforce in a unique way. In ways they are almost para-workers as they are neither fish nor fowl. Hopefully the legislation will take account of these categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> We talk about the need for family friendly policies, flexibility, etc., and the Bill goes some way towards addressing these issues. Section 9 states that part-time employees should not be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee if that treatment is based on objective grounds. This is an important provision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the teaching profession, in which I was involved for a number of years during the early stage of my career. There has been an increasing level of &ldquo;part-timeism&rdquo; in the teaching profession during recent years. As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Coughlan, knows from her involvement in vocational education committees, part of this has been regulated and EPT teachers have made significant progress in terms of their conditions of employment. However, as others have rightly said, there is an increasing number of teachers who work very few hours. They may be providing home tuition for difficult students who have been excluded from school, working on a specialist basis in schools or working across a number of schools. I was happy to hear the Minister say that a provision would be introduced under section 9(4) to deal with people who work less than eight hours per week. The number of these people will increase in the future. Agency care workers are being employed by residential homes, child care centres, etc., on a low threshold. These workers need to be protected.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of categories of work which are mainly related to women and are all related to part-time working, that is, contract catering and contract cleaning. Hundreds, if not thousands, of women in my constituency get up at 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. to clean office blocks in town, universities, etc. They work extremely hard for a not very good reward. There is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that the conditions under which they work are extremely poor and much less favourable than the conditions for day-time workers and those in the normal workforce. An investigation into the alleged practice by some contract cleaners to hire people under assumed names would be merited. The implications of this practice are enormous both from a moral point of view and its significant impact on the workers' entitlements under their real names. This issue has been brought to my attention and I am concerned about it. As I understand it, this practice is not confined to smaller companies. I have a similar concern about outdoor catering and to a lesser extent about the security industry. A Bill which will regulate the security industry will shortly be brought before the House.</P>
    <P>Another category of worker is second and third level students. Some third levels students work a great number of hours of necessity. The Minister has publicly expressed concern about this on a number of occasions. We must make the point to employers who recruit third level students that they must abide strictly to the hours these students are allowed to work. In many cases uni<Col N="740" /> versity or third level education is a rest from employment for students. Many students have significant disposable income. Only yesterday I came across a case where students who live away from home and look after themselves are working virtually full-time. I question how they will achieve a third level qualification which is commensurate with their ability.</P>
    <P>I have previously expressed this concern in regard to second level students. Last night I attended a school board meeting at which we were advised of the very high absentee rate among junior certificate, transition year and leaving certificate students. On some days of the week the rate can be as high as 30%. These days are Monday, when students are too tired after working the weekend, and Friday, when they are preparing to work the weekend. It went as far as the board asking that the approach to educating these young people be looked at by way of modular provision or part-time or continuing education. This is worrying. There is a shortage of workers but we are in danger of repeating the mistakes of the late 1960s when I first started teaching. The economy was booming at that time and young people took the first available job and worked as helpers on milk lorries and bread vans or took apprenticeships in what appeared to be fairly secure employment. However, these people were the first to lose their jobs when there was a downturn in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should reinforce the message to young people to stay in school and obtain the best possible qualifications. If necessary he should embark on a campaign aimed at employers, many of whom are small employers such as shopkeepers, restaurateurs and so on, not to exploit young people, even when they are willing to work long hours.</P>
    <P>I also wish to address the issue of the employment of older workers. The Minister of State referred to this in his speech and the matter is also referred to in the employment action plan under the Luxembourg process. There is a significant pool of talented workers who are prepared and anxious to remain in the workforce. However, these people are being asked to retire at 65 years of age. Last weekend I was approached by someone who works in a Department who could not understand why she was being advised that she could not work beyond 65. When I started working one could teach up to 68 years of age. There is no reason that option should not be available to people if they wish to remain in the workforce for a few extra years and build up their pension entitlements. Not everyone is burnt out by the time they are 55 or 65.</P>
    <P>Many older people aged 59 or 60 years of age are involved in CE schemes or have completed three years on these schemes. At that stage these people leave the schemes and have nothing to do between the ages of 60 and 65. These people sit at home and suffer serious loss of self-esteem. The Minister of State and the Minister should re-examine ways whereby such older people can <Col N="741" /> remain on CE schemes. Voluntary organisations, meals on wheels, sports clubs and football clubs all over the country would benefit from these people's expertise as they are good at a variety of work. It would be preferable if these people were working 20 or so hours per week rather than sitting at home. There is a limit to the number of times one can paint the windows, cut the grass or walk the dog. It would be far more productive, and it would not cost the State much money, if these people were allowed to remain in the workforce as CE workers.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant decrease in the level of long-term unemployment. However, large numbers of people still have very poor or no skills. I am not sure which section of the Bill to address in this regard but the Chair will advise me if I am wandering from the subject of the Bill. The Government's action plan on employment and local employment services are providing a wide range of courses for such people and a task force has been set up to deal with them. We need to upskill workers who have recently entered the workforce and who, with some in-service training, could move up and make way for workers waiting to enter the workforce. Such people have low skills and low levels of literacy or numeracy but are waiting for the opportunity to enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>A number of measures will enhance people's capacity to avail of this legislation. One such measure is the Government's policy on the provision of child care places. There has been a significant improvement in this area. However, one further provision would be worthwhile. Last year's Finance Act allowed employers to set up child care facilities and crèches. However, very few employers did so. In the interests of good worker relations and promoting family friendly policies, would it be possible to allow workers to contract out the provision of a crèche in a workplace where only a limited number of employees need to be catered for? We contract out many other services. I am not suggesting that because one contracts out catering or cleaning one can also contract out child care. I do not wish to reduce child care to such a mundane level but it might be possible to get people who would otherwise not be interested in setting up a child care facility to set one up in a workplace. The extension of paid maternity and adoptive leave is another significant improvement which will make a difference.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be an expert in the area of the rights commissioner which is dealt with in sections 16 and 17 but we must revisit the issue of access to a rights commissioner and the grievance procedure for part-time workers. I am not sure whether the Bill is too convoluted or whether, like Deputy Rabbitte, I find it difficult to understand the terminology used in these sections. However, I am concerned that the legislation is skewed in the direction of the rights of employers more than the rights of employees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> Part 3 of the Bill deals with miscellaneous issues and outlines that the legislation applies to posted workers. An increasing number of agency workers are coming from countries such as Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. I come across quite a number of such workers in north County Dublin working in the horticultural and construction industries. I am concerned that we do not always accord these people the same living, working, employment and pay conditions as Irish workers. If for no other reason than to protect this category of workers, I am glad the Minister of State is bringing forward this legislation.</P>
    <P>This is enlightened legislation which will be teased out forensically on Committee Stage. I would ask the Minister of State to address my concerns, particularly the issue of those working less than eight hours and older workers. Can we be as enlightened as regards the continuation of employment opportunities for older workers as we are for younger and other workers? Can we ensure that employers are made to adhere rigidly to the provisions of this legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. This House has introduced more legislation than any other European parliament. What is the point introducing legislation in this House when we do not have people to implement it? Many Bills have been introduced here over the past 12 months but we have not seen any action. If this legislation is passed &ndash; I am sure there will be amendments on Committee Stage &ndash; will we have the people to implement it?</P>
      <P>Many changes have taken place in the past ten years. The biggest change is the shortage of workers in the workplace. In the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s women did not get the credit they deserved. They stayed at home during the day, got the children out to school and made the dinner and tea. They worked at night-time to help raise their families. However, the State did nothing for them. It put every obstacle it could in their way. For many years women, like the Irish when they went to America and England &ndash; I am glad the trend is changing and that people now want to live in this country &ndash; got the most menial jobs and the worst pay. In some cases Irish people who did well abroad did not pay other Irish people they employed or look after them. Women had to work in hotels, guesthouses and restaurants because they needed money to raise their families. The State did not help or protect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care about employers, although I am one. I am glad the tide has turned. I am glad to see advertisements in major restaurants which state that they will pay £7 and £8 an hour. This is not because they want to pay it but because there is a shortage of workers. Thank God the tide has turned. Women were treated like dirt for long enough. They were paid only £2 an hour while home helps, which I will mention later, were paid £1 an hour. In some cases if they did not smile at an employer at the end of the week, they would <Col N="743" /> not be paid. These women had no one to turn to because there was no protection for them. If they told anyone, they were laughed at. If employers want people to work for them, they must treat them properly and pay them. Thank God these workers are now protected in legislation. The minimum wage is a step in the right direction. It took a long time but I am glad it is in place. People, particularly those in part-time jobs, were badly treated for too long because employers did not have any difficulty getting people to work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey is right when he speaks about older people. Gardaí can retire at 55 years of age. However, while some of them go into full-time employment they can still retain their pension. Will that pension now be taken from them if they accept full-time employment? Pensions should be made available to people who want to retire. However, if people want to stay in the workplace when they reach the relevant retirement age, depending on the company in which they are employed, they should be allowed to do so on a part-time basis and to pay tax. I have seen many fine men and women, who do not look the pension age, give up work and become old overnight because their structure has changed. They are used to getting up in the mornings, working five days a week and planning their lives. When their lifestyle suddenly changes, some of them feel there is nothing left for which to live. It is fine for those who have planned their retirement, are self-employed or have families in business whom they might be able to help. However, we should accommodate people who, when they reach pension age, want to work specific hours and take their pension. The tax code should reflect that these people have made a major contribution to society and they should be helped and encouraged to stay in the workplace.</P>
    <P>As regards part-time workers and women who have stayed at home but who want to go back into full-time employment, every advertisement for jobs includes a sentence that if they do not qualify under a FÁS scheme there will not be any work for them. Women, whose husbands may be working and who stay at home to raise their families, may not want to sign for social welfare or to go into the dole office. They should be assisted and given the same rights and benefits in terms of PRSI as someone who is unemployed for more than 12 months and is on social welfare. These people have made a sacrifice for this country by staying at home to raise their families. However, when they want to get back into the workplace, they should be helped not hindered. I hope legislation is introduced in the near future to change that.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the minimum wage means things are not as they were 20 years ago. Everyone wants everything to be right. They want their employers to pay tax and they want to pay their PRSI. The time has come when people believe that everyone in the State should pay tax. It is only right that employees are looked after. Part-<Col N="744" /> time workers get a few hours of work per week and some of them are on low incomes. If, for example, a woman who is separated and has a few children, receives the lone parents allowance and has a part-time job in the local chip shop or hotel, looks for a medical card, she will be disqualified because the income limit is £95 for her and £16.50 per child. That woman's income from her part-time job should be disregarded. It should not be calculated as means for any scheme, whether it is lone parents allowance or the medical card. These people are only subsidising their income to help their children and to live from day to day because they cannot live on social welfare. I hope the Minister considers that.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned farmers' wives. They have also been discriminated against. They have not got the recognition for the work they do on the farm. Every obstacle is put in the way of some of these people who want to go into full-time employment. They are penalised because their husbands are receiving headage payments or payments under the farm retirement scheme. The Minister should deal with that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As regards part-time teachers who are employed by the Department, which is the biggest offender, they worked a number of weeks of the year. When the school was closed at Easter or Christmas, it was degrading to see them going into the social welfare office and signing for social welfare. They did not get a pension or any rights from the State. I know some changes have been made in that regard. If someone works on a part-time basis, they should get part-time rights and contributions and their pension entitlements. They should not be discriminated against. We saw a case a number of years ago where the State discriminated against women. They won their case in Europe and the State had to pay them millions of pounds. That will happen in the area of pensions at a future date, particularly for people who worked on a part-time basis and who should have got their part-time rights and pension entitlements. These people should be looked after.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is a woman in the Chair, and I mean that sincerely. I came from a big family and I have to say the women of the house do not get the credit, respect or honour they deserve. In the west of Ireland, when husbands, like my own father, had to go to England, the mother had to play the role of father and earner. She did everything that had to be done. In the past, these women did not receive the respect and honour they should have had. Women today would not put up with what women had to in the past, and they are right. I compliment the women of the past, however. They were great women to put up with what they had to do. They were loyal, did the job, worked hard and raised good families.</P>
    <P>We are living in changing times now, however. Every day I listen to Ministers telling us how well we are doing and what a great lifestyle we have, yet we were never as unhappy and never had less time off. Not only in politics but in every other <Col N="745" /> walk of life, people see less and less of their families and they do not seem to be any happier. They are working harder and have more commitments, including bigger mortgages, yet if they get £1 million they want more. If they are given a house they want two, and if they are given two houses they want three. There seems to be no way of satisfying people now. I never had any great love for money, although I always wanted to have enough.</P>

      <P>I would not deny that I always wanted to have enough to be able to pay my bills, but I did not ever wanted to be a millionaire. I always wanted to be secure in the hope that I could educate my family and do whatever else had to be done. We seem to be becoming more unhappy, however, and people are becoming more violent. We are drinking more than ever before and we have less and less social life. Even sporting organisations cannot get anybody to bring young people out to play sports. My town of Westport has three great clubs catering for rugby, soccer and GAA games. Last week, however, we could not get people to take up officers' positions in the soccer club. We cannot get anyone to take people out on a Saturday to play football. We cannot get people to look after children in sporting organisations. We can no longer get them to assist in any voluntary capacity.</P>
      <P>We have become mean, greedy and selfish, like people in America. I heard Deputy Noonan saying at his press conference that while he would like to live in America he would not like to grow old there. I would hate to see this country becoming like America. We have our own special qualities. There was a time when one could go into a neighbour's house to sit down and talk. There was a time when one would know everybody in the street. There was a time when one could have a chat and talk to people, but now they are speeding around in motor cars or they are flying up and down by plane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody knows who is living beside them. Recently, three people were found dead in a house where they had remained for three or four months and nobody knew about it. That would not have happened 50 years ago. At that time, people may not have had much but they had pride in their families and their local areas. That has all gone now and it is like America. I would not like to live in America. They have no sense of humour, they go to bed at 7 p.m. and are up at 6 o'clock in the morning. They are like machines, all computerised, and there is no bit of fun in them. There was always a bit of life in this country and we always liked to be able to live here. Wherever we went in the world we were able to sell the message of Ireland. I hope that does not change, but I think it has been changing in recent years. People may consider that they are better off, but I do not think they are. We are worse off and we are becoming more selfish, viol<Col N="746" /> ent and unhappy. I do not know what the answer is.</P>
    <P>People who work on a part-time basis should be protected and I hope the Bill will achieve that because they were unprotected for long enough. I hope those who need protection will be protected. Is the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act actually working? Are officials of the Minister's Department examining the situation? Young people were abused for a long time, working in places for 16 or 17 hours. This happened simply because they came from poor families and needed the money to supplement the family income. I welcome the Bill and hope it will help part-time workers who have been abused for too long. They should be protected and given every assistance they need. I hope that whatever amendments are required will be tabled on Committee Stage so that the legislation will protect people working on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the women of the country. They are not honoured or looked after enough.</P>

      <P>In reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 7 to 10 from the Deputy on 8 November 2000, I outlined the specific recommendations in the Nally report on the public prosecution system relating to the Chief State Solicitor's office. These were the transfer of the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the transfer of the State solicitor services from the Attorney General to the DPP. An appointment to the post of solicitor to the DPP has recently been made.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, a group comprising representatives from the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General, including the Chief State Solicitor's office, and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, was set up to oversee implementation of the recommendations. Some progress has been made but, notwithstanding extensive negotiations by the group, agreement has not been reached with the staff side on the subject of additional staff resources and structures in the enhanced prosecution service. Efforts to find a solution are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparation for the transfer of the criminal division, regular meetings are being held at a high <Col N="749" /> level between the DPP's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of questions arise from the Taoiseach's reply. We had a comprehensive exchange of views on 8 November. Given that the Taoiseach said the appointment to the post of solicitor has been made, can I take it that that person is <i>in situ</i> and working or has there been agreement to establish the post? Perhaps the Taoiseach would clarify that point. Why has it taken so long, notwithstanding the extensive consultations and negotiations? In the subsequent reply on 8 November he revealed that there was a virtual exodus of staff from the Chief State Solicitor's office, not to mention his own. Clearly there is a problem in relation to the recruitment and retention of people in the public service. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the post is actually occupied and the person appointed is working there? Will he outline the difficulties and when he hopes to have them resolved? Is it a matter of salary scales, job description or other factors of which we do not know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first question, I am nearly certain that the individual has actually taken up office. If that is incorrect I will inform the Deputy but the process finished a number of weeks ago. If the person is not in place he or she is about to be. However, I will confirm the position for the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of the question is not so easy. The Deputy will recall that through the summer there were detailed negotiations. An offer giving what were considered significant improvements, promotional outlets and starting scales was put to the union in the summer. That offer was rejected by a substantial majority of union members. The negotiations resumed after the holiday period and new significantly enhanced proposals were put in November. This improved offer was also rejected and strike action was threatened. Almost at the strike date it was agreed by both sides to have a third party report and intervention on all the negotiations that had taken place. John Dowling, former director of the Bar Counsel, took up that task acting as an independent mediator. He has reviewed all the outstanding issues. The strike action did not commence. His report is due at the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations dealt with staff resources, grading issues but the issue of numbers was a significant problem. The November offer which was rejected allowed for the creation of 75 additional posts which was well up, as Deputy Quinn will recall when we discussed this matter here in the <Col N="750" /> summer. We await the outcome of this final effort. I have given every encouragement, support and resource to try to resolve this issue. In the meantime some progress has been made but not as much as one would have wished pending the additional staff required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a few brief questions on what action might have been taken on other recommendations? With regard to the appointment of the solicitor to the DPP, has a decision been made on the transfer of power to that solicitor to take decisions on whether to prosecute? One of the recommendations in the report is not only to appoint a solicitor to the DPP but to delegate power to that solicitor to take decisions on whether to prosecute specific categories of cases. At present the Attorney General appoints/ nominates State solicitors. The report recommends that in future State solicitors be selected by the Civil Service Commission. Has that happened? Has the common pool of staff been established through the various legal offices under the Taoiseach's jurisdiction &ndash; the Chief State Solicitor's ffice, the DPP, the Attorney General &ndash; so that staff members can seek promotion and transfer between those offices? There is a strong recommendation, in page 36 of the report, that a substantial extension of the range of fines, not confined to traffic offences which can be dealt with in the same way as on-the-spot fines, should be dealt with on a strong recommendation from the Garda Commissioner. That would require legislation. What progress has been made on that with a view to making more effective use of Garda time and our court system?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the administrative and technical issues have been dealt with; some of the other issues have not. Responsibility for the State solicitors has been transferred from the Attorney General to the DPP. That has been agreed with a legislative provision to enable the DPP to delegate them.</P>
      <P>I understand that will require an amendment to the 1974 Act. I am not sure what progress has been made, but that is what has been agreed. The appointment of the Chief State Solicitor should be made on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commission. Discussions on this have been held between the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and the Civil Service Commission, but agreement has not been reached. Agreement on adequate staffing levels and the appropriate staff structures has not been resolved, but it has been reached on the procedures involved. The criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office will be transferred to the DPP's office to form a unit headed by the solicitor to the DPP. Again, with the necessary statutory clarification that will be done in the same amendment to the 1974 Act. It can be done as soon as the staffing issue has been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The common pool of staff entitled to apply for transfer and promotion among the various legal <Col N="751" /> offices and in accordance with various Civil Service procedures has also been agreed. Again, it links in with the staffing issue, but agreement has been reached on the way to proceed. The current negotiations are more concerned with the numbers involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations centred on shortening the number of increments on the existing salary scale. However, most of the discussions have been concerned with the numbers involved. A figure of 75 was suggested but that has been rejected. Not wishing to become involved in the work of the mediator, I understand a figure of 75 will not resolve the issue.</P>

      <P>That may have been legislated for.

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the reorganisation of the Chief State Solicitor's office and changes to procedures in the office. He will be aware that before the Christmas recess I raised with him and his colleagues the problems being created for organisations that have received grants arising from the need for deeds of trust and the delays in this regard in the office. The Taoiseach's colleagues were very helpful in their advice and I understood from them that new procedures were to be put in place to address this by perhaps removing some procedures from the office. Will the Taoiseach indicate the progress made in this regard? Major problems arise when sporting and community organisations seek to draw down grants and they are unable to obtain the required deeds of trust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of similar cases. Substantial progress has been made in addressing this issue. Much has centred on the ownership of the land, be it a local authority or a corporation. Concerns were raised that the club or organisation could sell the land if it was not of use.</P>

Dublin Corporation, the county councils, the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office have been working on finding a way forward that would not impose an enormous burden and legal fee on the organisations concerned. I am not aware of the outcome, but I will ask the relevant parties to communicate with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there is a staffing crisis in the Chief State Solicitor's office? Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to one of the many problems that have arisen. Local bodies face major difficulties in trying to advance and implement Government policy, even where grants have been allocated to them. Apparently little progress has been made since this issue was raised last November. On 8 November I asked the Taoiseach if he would be prepared to contract out services if agreement cannot be reached throughout the negotiating process to avoid the problems that have been mentioned. What are his views on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to a problem that has arisen because of the need for openness, transparency and accountability and the requirement to clarify issues that previously would not have been addressed in such a manner. However, given the present climate this must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to find a simple resolution. One Deputy told me of a person who, having received a grant of approximately £11,000, had to pay legal fees of £1,500 to resolve the issues arising. I have instructed the relevant parties to produce a simpler system that does not impose huge legal burdens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done so. There is not a serious breakdown here. An industrial relations <Col N="753" /> problem has arisen that must be addressed. Notwithstanding the favourable economic climate for solicitors, where they have left the public sector in great numbers, many use their experiences in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to progress their careers. I do not blame people for doing this, but the remuneration and numbers employed must be increased because of work pressures. An enormous amount of additional work has arisen, including in the asylum area and in the tribunals. It is not a case of people in the office seeking something for nothing. Genuine issues have arisen which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge increase in resources for staffing, IT, organisation structures and the library and information systems. In addition, there has been increased training and career assistance and a move has been made to merge various functions in the relevant State offices. This has not satisfied staff members so we must persevere until they are satisfied. Although we have offered a big increase in staffing levels the outstanding issues have not been resolved. Based on these reports I hope they will be in the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The Government intends to continue having meetings in regional centres. The policy was introduced last year and meetings to date have been held in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, Knocknaheeny, County Cork and at Faithlegg, County Waterford. The public interest and warm welcome justifies the organisational effort behind the initiative. The number, timing and location of meetings to take place this year have yet to be determined. Announcements in respect of a regional meeting of the Government will be made only a short period before the meeting.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Handbook was published in October 1998. Two amendments to the handbook were published in 1999, dealing with policy proofing of Government memoranda for issues of regulatory reform and rural development. Incorporation of a further amendment approved last year in relation to statute law &ndash; restatement &ndash; will follow the enactment of the relevant legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The text of the Irish translation of the handbook is currently with the printers. Production will be completed shortly and publication will follow as soon as can be arranged. No further <Col N="754" /> amendments to the handbook are under consideration at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate where meetings outside Government Buildings are to be held? Will they be held in strategically located places where seats may need to be held or fought over? Will the Taoiseach tell the House the average cost of holding meetings outside of Government Buildings, given that when Governments hold meetings outside, they involve themselves with political work when in a particular location? Is there a separation of the cost of holding the Government meeting and Ministers doing political work when in a particular area, whether Roscommon, Waterford or Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballaghaderreen was chosen as it was the central location chosen for the launch of the western region's offices. Knocknaheeny was the central location for the southern group, while Waterford was the central location for the south eastern group. Two of the meetings coincided with meetings of the regional areas and all the other representatives attended the Knocknaheeny meeting. That was the reason the meetings took place at the beginning of last year. This made sense, given that the Government intended holding meetings. This aspect will be taken into consideration when holding further meetings. The costs involved are low. Usually Government meetings last for a full day and, while there was some political activity, I recall this took place in just one of the venues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to Government meetings being held outside of Dublin. It is probably good to bring Government around the country provided either of the Government parties do not try to promote themselves.</P>
      <P>On the Cabinet Handbook, in view of the information regarding the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, are there proposals to change any of the declarations Ministers must make to the Taoiseach? We must all make declarations under the ethics in public office legislation, but certain information is also given to the Taoiseach of the day. In light of the Government's experience in discovering matters about some of the Taoiseach's appointees, are there proposals to change any of the regulations or requirements governing Ministers or Ministers of State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as yet. On the issue referred to by the Deputy, the Minister of State indicated on that form that the company properly complied. The matter will go to the commission and due process will take its course, therefore I do not wish to say more on the matter. I have been considering more carefully the monitoring of these forms in relation to the information given that the detail is fairly scant &ndash; not particularly in relation to this case. The Deputy will appreciate that I would normally have a quick look at the forms, I would not study related companies to see <Col N="755" /> whether more details should be provided in the forms. I have asked for advice on this aspect. I do not think a change in the handbook is required because it is already specific on that issue. In the case mentioned, the Deputy declared an interest in that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there have been clear breaches of Cabinet secrecy and information &ndash; I am reminded of the faxes exchanged when the Government was in the process of making a decision on the size of supermarkets, when the Taoiseach received a fax from a particular person&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to the question. What changes in the Cabinet Handbook has the Taoiseach implemented or is he proposing to implement to ensure that when a Member of the Cabinet breaches Cabinet confidentiality a full investigation is carried out, the person is identified and the appropriate sanction is imposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibilities of Members of the Cabinet are well documented in the handbook and this has been the case for several years. On the question of leaks, the example given by the Deputy was not a leak. People sent data to me and to other Ministers, therefore it was not a leak. However, as the Deputy will be aware, leaks are investigated by the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Owen, did I correctly hear him say on the matter of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, not declaring an interest in respect of his family farm having a licence to feed meat and bone meal to animals, when he voted in the House on a Private Members' Bill, notwithstanding his responsibility with regard to food, that he does not propose to take any action until the Public Offices Commission has examined and adjudicated on the complaint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I wish to clarify. Does the Taoiseach believe he is not in a position to accept his political responsibility because one aspect is before the Public Offices Commission? Is that the rule the Taoiseach is following? Is he in effect saying he cannot act or discharge his political responsibility because one aspect of the matter is being considered by the Public Offices Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go through all the details. In relation to the aspect correctly raised by Deputy Owen, the Minister of State does not have anything to answer. However, there are other matters which must be investigated. While I have a political responsibility, people are entitled to due process under the Act. The Member in question is complying with the Public Offices Commission. There would not be any point in having a Public Offices Commission if someone else was to do the job for it. On the aspect covered by me in relation to the forms, the Minister does not have a question to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter referred to by the Taoiseach, I wish to bring him back to the question of due process. While I do not disagree with what he said regarding due process, I put it to him that there is a danger of his abdicating responsibility on this issue. Surely there is a question of political accountability. Perhaps I could cite another case to the Taoiseach, that of his colleague, the Minister for the Marine. Will he proffer a view on requests for further information that may from time to time issue from the Public Offices Commission? Does he have a view on the speed with which such a query might be answered to the satisfaction of the committee, or is the Taoiseach willing to take a wait and see, hands-off, &ldquo;not for me&rdquo;, &ldquo;none of my business&rdquo; approach? Is that what he means by due process or does he have any responsibility in relation to these issues?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach a view on outstanding queries that may have been lawfully raised by the Public Offices Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On any information or query, Ministers or Deputies should deal with these matters speedily. As Whip, the Deputy will be aware that there are a great number of queries between Deputies, Senators and the Public Offices Commission. I am aware of this as leader of my party as well as in my position as Taoiseach. People should answer queries speedily. I have said to my colleagues that, wherever there is doubt, they <Col N="757" /> should err on the side of giving excessive information.</P>
      <P>On the other aspect, Deputy Owen asked the correct question. If the Ministers of State in their declaration to me had not declared their involvement and engagement in a company, it would be a matter for me. If it is an aspect of what happens within the House or within legislation, the person is entitled to due process and it might or might not come back to me because I have a political responsibility. However, the point at issue in this is a point that is before the Public Offices Commission and I have no more to say about that.</P>

      <P>It is hard to follow with a supplementary question when I have not seen the list. Will the Taoiseach give a flavour of the distribution of the staff? We are aware that one principal officer has been seconded to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to keep the Taoiseach's line of communication open to Campus Ireland. How is the Taoiseach's Department operating without the 26 staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>About six have gone to the Information Society Commission, four have gone to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to deal with area development, which was transferred to that Department some years ago, five have gone to Áras an Uachtaráin, two to the Office of the Attorney General, three to Campus Ireland, one to the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants, one to the Royal Irish Academy, some to the tribunals, one to Media Lab Europe, one to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and one to the European Investment Bank. If that is not 26, it is near enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a wide range of staff. How does the Taoiseach's Department operate without so many staff? Have the vacancies been filled? Why can the other Departments not fill those jobs? What is the purpose of sending so many staff to these different agencies? It is interesting that three have gone to Campus Ireland. I thought only one had gone. There are now three there to keep an eye on things for the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the Deputy did not listen to my reply. They have gone to the ADM company which was previously in the Department of the Taoiseach before being moved to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The same applies to the Information Society Commission. When it was set up some <Col N="760" /> years ago it moved to Dublin Castle so the staff in the Department moved with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton set it up so obviously it was not too good at propaganda. A number of staff have been with Áras an Uachtaráin down through the years. Only three of the 26 would fall outside the normal movement of staff. Deputy Owen should remember from her term at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that people often move from a Department as a result of promotion but would hold onto their existing Department. Not many did that in my case but people would often stay with their line Department. It often happens when people move with a Minister or Minister of State.</P>

It also updates the material in the strategy statement in light of developments in the intervening period refocusing on the DepartmentWP extended char 4,28s aims and objectives to bring it forward into 2001 and beyond.</P>
      <P>The report was prepared in accordance with section 4(1)(b) of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. Work on progress achieved during 2000 under the statement is currently under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that if one looks at progress and improvements, the Department of the Taoiseach would get a bad mark for the offices we discussed earlier, given the slowness in improving services in the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which are under the Department's aegis? Will the Taoiseach out<Col N="761" /> line the new tools to help the Department to assess performance in qualitative terms over a range of activities, as was mentioned in chapter four?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The workload of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor's office, apart from the IR difficulty they are currently trying to deal with, has never been greater and the work has never been more efficient. Credit for this is also owed to the former Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson. The offices are now more efficient in legislative terms, order terms and statute terms than they have been since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the Public Service Management Act and the SMI process which involves an all-party committee of the House dealing across all Departments by bringing together modern management techniques. Within the Civil Service, even though it is a difficult time, there has been a major extension of the strategic management initiative process as a driver of change throughout the public service. The SMI division has been putting in place a strategic management framework, office by office and Department by Department, as provided for in the Public Service Management Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The programme for change has been underpinned by formal partnership agreements in every sector of the public sector using participative structures, management, unions and staff. An enormous number of people throughout the agencies of the State have worked extremely hard and put huge effort into the modernisation programme. It is not easy but they are doing their utmost. I am grateful for their efforts in trying to progess this. I have supported them with resources and in whatever way I can. Last year they produced a comprehensive programme of what they are about and they are doing their best to achieve it. It is not always easy. Departments can be overstaffed or people might be overworked. They are working at it.</P>
      <P>What Departments and agencies are about, what they are trying to do and how they spell it out in their blueprints is something that was never done before. It is most rewarding and useful for staff. I am not saying there is not a lot more to be done but the all-party group is working with them to do it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>When I answered Dáil questions on 6 December 2000, I provided a description of MediaLab Europe and the digital media district, now being promoted as the Digital Hub.</P>
      <P>As part of the decision to establish MediaLab Europe, legal agreements were concluded between the Government and MIT, the Government and MediaLab Europe and between MIT and MediaLab Europe setting out in detail the undertakings of all the parties involved.</P>
      <P>The agreement between MIT and MediaLab Europe broadly covers intellectual property rights; undertakings regarding the contribution and input of MIT staff, researchers and students at MediaLab Europe; arrangements on commercial sponsorship of research projects undertaken at MediaLab Europe; and financial arrangements between MIT and MediaLab Europe.</P>
      <P>The Government is investing £28 million in establishing MediaLab Europe, with £8.4 million of this due to MIT. Already, £7.4 million has been paid to MIT and £6.6 million has been paid to MediaLab Europe. In addition, £15 million has been allocated for the purchase of a suitable premises for MediaLab Europe. The premises will remain in State ownership and will be leased to MediaLab Europe at a nominal rent. A fund of £1 million per annum, to be administered by the Higher Education Authority, has also been created for collaborative research between MediaLabEurope and Irish universities. To date, 11 projects have received approval.</P>
      <P>The Government separately decided to establish a digital media district which will be clustered in the Liberties, Coombe and Thomas Street areas, with MediaLab Europe at its heart. An executive services team, appointed by Digital Media Development Limited, the body set up by the Government to oversee the development of the Digital Hub, is currently working on a strategic development programme to ensure that it becomes a premier international location for Internet, multimedia and information and communication technology industries on the basis that it ensures world class quality and innovation in enterprise; respects the existing character and heritage of the Liberties, Coombe and Thomas Street areas; employs best practice in the construction and renewal of a balanced range of facilities to make up the Digital Hub; and engages the local community in the development process, not least through maximising the benefit from learning and employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> A priority for the company in the start-up phase is consultation with the local community. An initial information brochure has been distributed door to door to residents and businesses. This brochure was also mailed to all TDs, Senators and Dublin city councillors inviting feedback. Contact has since been made with all TDs and councillors representing the local area. Since January, the executive services team has begun liaising with local community groups in order to inform and involve them in the preparation of a vision document for the Digital Hub to be produced in April 2001. In tandem with this ongoing process, a questionnaire is to be distributed to each householder and business in the local area in February to give a complete opportunity for comment, feedback and input into the development of the project.</P>

      <P>The Green Party is keen to see the establishment of a high skilled, low environmental impact technological base in Ireland. However, we are also keen that any moneys funding IT research should be open to tender to Irish institutes and individuals. Why is that not the case in this instance? Does the Taoiseach understand, as I do, that other institutes such as the Centre for the Study of Language and Information at Stanford, are prepared to come to Ireland without receiving any &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money? Rutgers University has expressed a similar desire. Why is it necessary to provide what <i>The Irish Times</i> quotes as £40 million State funding &ndash; the Taoiseach outlined a number of other figures including a sum of £28 million &ndash; if other institutes would be happy to locate here in the absence of such funding?</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect to other institutions, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MediaLab Europe are much sought after, world renowned organisations. Thankfully, Mr. Ira Magaziner, President Clinton's adviser, put us in touch with these organisations some years ago as a result of which Mr. Negroponte, a world renowned expert in this area, agreed to seriously consider Ireland as a multimedia centre. Ireland got in before other European countries. MIT and MediaLab Europe are currently considering the location of a project in India which, if successful, will probably be far larger than the Irish one. I do not deny that other bodies may be interested in locating here but the Deputy will be aware of the high powered people on the board &ndash; Mr. Nicholas Negroponte, the chairman, Dr. Rudolph Burger, who has taken over as chief executive officer, Mr. Gerhard Schulmeyer, current chief executive officer of Siemens, Mr. Bob Metcalf, founder of 3Com who is currently with International Data Group, Mr. Larry Bacow, chancellor of MIT, Mr. Denis O'Brien, Mr. Danny O'Hare, ex-president of DCU, Mr. Red Burns, head of Communication Multi-media in New York, Ms Ann Riordan, the <Col N="764" /> outgoing manager of Microsoft and Bono of U2. This project will live on after the initial relatively small allocation of resources although I am not saying it is small in terms of world-wide business. In the years ahead, the project will live on its name and will effectively be funded through commercial sponsorship.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, we would have had a very limited research and development budget but investment of £1.95 billion has been allocated to research and development in the national plan in the context of MediaLab Europe. A sum of £560 million is being allocated to the Technology Foresight Fund following its report on establishing Ireland as a world class centre for information and communication technology and biotechnology. In addition, a sum of £220 million is being allocated to research programmes in third level institutions in a public private initiative and the Government decision approving the MediaLab Europe project also included approval for funding to Irish universities to allow them to develop good relationships with and engage in collaborative projects with MediaLab. The Higher Education Authority is the approval body for these projects.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the decision to invest in MediaLab Europe was taken in the knowledge that an unprecedented level of resources is being committed to third level research and development. While I do not have any knowledge of the institutions referred to by the Deputy, they are not necessarily ruled out of consideration in terms of the overall project.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Sargent, I do not claim to be the world expert in this area but these people are the experts and they are looking at advanced technologies that did not exist here.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 30 January 2001, over 300 Defence Forces personnel, including the current contingent of 104 personnel, have served with the Irish Transport Company in Kosovo as part of KFOR. As a result of recent public concern regarding possible environmental and health risks relating to the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Balkans, the Defence Forces sent an investigative team comprising an Ordnance Corps officer and a medical officer to Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina early last month. Their findings confirm earlier assessments of normal levels of background radiation. Continuous testing of food and water has shown them to be safe and radiation levels in camps occupied by Irish troops were tested and found to be safe. While there, the team liaised with the medical authorities of KFOR and SFOR. On the basis of this and other evidence available to them, the Defence Forces have assessed the threat to the health of the Irish troops in the Balkans as negligible.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the above, the Defence Forces have put in place a medical screening programme for all Irish troops who have served or are serving in the Balkan region as well as personnel who served as military observers in Kuwait following the Gulf War. All personnel, including those who have retired, are being called to the various brigade centres to undergo the screening. The screening programme commenced last month. This medical screening programme has been put in place to provide reassurance for personnel and their families and includes blood and urine tests along with a clinical examination. A Defence Forces medical officer will depart for Kosovo today to conduct medical screening of the 104 members of the Third Transport Company serving with KFOR who are due to return to Ireland in March 2001.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response. There was a lot of concern on this issue which the Minister may have heard in the media at the time. How many people have been screened to date and have any unusual symptoms turned up in the screening process? As the Minister is probably aware, about 13,000 Belgians also served in the Balkans and they found that five personnel had leukaemia while approximately 1,000 others had what were classified as unusual symptoms. They were not specific in regard to the unusual symptoms but perhaps the Minister would indicate if anything unusual is coming out of the medical process.</P>

Despite the most exhaustive contact and liaison with all of the hospitals and the medical authorities, nothing has emerged so far which would lead us to the view that any of our troops were exposed to any threat. However, I do not have the exact numbers who have been screened but in regard to those who have been screened, nothing has been discovered so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>These questions arise from the Final Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions which was published by the Minister for Finance on 30 January 2001. The commission specifically addressed the issue of pensionability of allowances, including the military service allowance, and the consequences for pensioners generally in chapter 22, section 6 of its final report. It indicated that it had obtained actuarial advice on the impact of making the allowances in question pensionable in the specific case of Garda and Defence Forces' pensioners for future pension payments only. The commission was advised that at 1997 costs, this would result in an immediate increase in expenditure of £9 million a year and that the accrued liabilities of the State would increase by £116 million if this change were implemented for both groups.</P>
      <P>The commission, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with the long standing public service pensions policy in that context and the cost implications involved, did not recommend any concession. Its conclusions are contained in paragraph 22.6.6 of the report, which states:</P>
      <P>The Commission has shown that the cost of any change in policy on this matter would be substantial. In addition, a change in policy would possibly be extended to other groups with similar claims for pension increases. Accordingly, having assessed the arguments involved, the Commission does not recommend any increase for the groups concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> The Government intends to make formal decisions on the commission's recommendations once it has an opportunity to consider the report in detail. In publishing the report, the Minister for Finance noted in particular the view that the commission's recommendations as set out in its final report represent an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions and that in implementing this strategy, it would be important to preserve the integrity of the package of the measures as a whole. This element will be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been debated at length and I am sure that the Minister, as well as Opposition spokespersons on Defence, have had numerous representations in relation to it. We have a situation where, after 1990, all the members of the representative forces have this military service allowance included for calculation of their pension yet the people who, in essence, set the standards for the Department of Defence due to their efforts overseas, many of whom would have served in the Congo and everywhere else, now find that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am approaching that now, a Cheann Comhairle. Those people now find that they are not getting a payment that people who came after them are receiving. It is difficult to understand how we reached this decision. Despite the fact that the representative associations made strong representations to the survey group, they still have not been accepted. Will the Minister, in the final assessment by the Government of this report, support the representative bodies which have done tremendous work? On many occasions in the House the Minister spoke about the pride he felt when he went overseas and saw the work they had done and the good name they had created for the country, yet we are depriving those people of this payment in the most critical time of their lives. Will the Minister bring the views of the representative association to the Government table to see if we can do something to alleviate what is an awful discrepancy in relation to pension payments for members of the Defence Forces?</P>

      <P>Since 1982 in the context of Garda pensions and since 1990 in the context of pensions for Defence Forces personnel issues of this nature have been thrashed out by successive Governments. In the final analysis it was decided, to once and for all establish the correct course of action, to have a commission receive representations from the various interests and for it to assess the merits, having regard to established superannuation practices and the economic cost, and to make a free and independent decision. In <Col N="769" /> many cases it could be said, and I understand the Deputy's concerns, that one might have expected some type of concession to emerge, but that is not the position. The commission was very clear in its deliberations.</P>

      <Quest>the equipment modernisation programme of the Air Corps; the equipment to be provided out of the allocation of £55 million; the timescale for the delivery of the equipment; and the details of the equipment including helicopters and other equipment that will be delivered on a phased basis over a three year period.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fully recognises there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I announced on 1 March last year the allocation of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The first indicator of this investment is the current project for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. The tender competition for the acquisition of the helicopters is progressing well. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
      <P>The tender competition is being carried out in two stages, a request for proposals &ndash; RFP &ndash; stage and a request for tenders &ndash; RFT &ndash; stage. Responses for the RFP were received in the Department on 21 September 2000. Six responses were received.</P>
      <P>The six responses have been evaluated at this stage and a short list of companies for participation in the RFT stage has been drawn up. The documentation for the RFT stage is almost complete and it is expected it will issue in a matter of days. Following receipt of tenders a comprehensive evaluation process will begin on the proposed helicopters. The evaluation will, of necessity, take some time to complete. It is expected the Department will be in a position to place a contract around the middle of this year.</P>
      <P>The responses to the RFP carried a range of possible delivery dates for the proposed helicopters. However, the lead-in time for the delivery of the helicopters is a matter that will have to be discussed with the successful tenderer in due course. I can assure the Deputies that every effort will be made to have the helicopters delivered at the earliest possible dates, while also taking account of the intensive training requirements involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, other equipment requirements in the Air Corps. A priority is the requirement to acquire fixed wing training aircraft for <Col N="770" /> Air Corps cadets and officers. When proposals are received from the military authorities in relation to this I will arrange for my Department to progress the matter as one of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The response is similar to that given in December. When does the Minister anticipate the two medium lift helicopters will be delivered if they are ordered in mid 2001? How does the Minister intend filling the vacuum where there is no 24 hour search and rescue service provided in Waterford by the Air Corps? That service has not been provided for the past 18 months. I have already asked the Minister if he envisages entering into some type of leasing arrangement to put that important component in place on the south east coastline. Is the Minister aware that in recent times there has been correspondence with the Department from the representative body of seafarers who are extremely concerned about the lack of service along the south east coast? I am sure the Minister is aware that a person died in recent times off the coast of Wexford and that it was stated locally that if the service was being provided from Waterford his life would have been saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government works as a unit, but the Deputy will appreciate that search and rescue is primarily a matter for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, and that the Department of Defence is an agent in the supply of services. It is a matter which must be urgently addressed. That is why I have made financial provision to ensure we are in a position to purchase as quickly as we can the necessary aircraft to enable us supply those services.</P>
      <P>We expect that four companies &ndash; Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Limited from England, Eurocopter from France and CHC Scotia from Scotland &ndash; will be in the tender process. I expect I will have the opportunity, when the final decision is taken about who wins the tender, to engage in negotiations as to what interim arrangements can be made to speed up the time for the supply of the necessary aircraft to enhance the services and to move towards the training and other requirements in the Air Corps, to which I am very committed. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to give an indication of how successful I will be in this before we have a successful tenderer, but I am determined.</P>

In accordance with the strategic report produced by Price Waterhouse for the Department of the Taoiseach in 1998, which referred to Air Corps continuation within the search and rescue service, does the Minister still <Col N="771" /> see the Air Corps as having a pivotal role at Finner and Waterford?</P>

      <Quest>the proposals he has to specifically target non-nationals for recruitment to the Defence Forces, especially having regard to the increasing multi-cultural nature of Irish society; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While Defence Forces regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of non-nationals, arising from the recent debate, I have asked that these regulations be examined and up-dated. At present the military authorities have the authority to approve applicants for enlistment who are not Irish nationals. Each application in taken on its merits and examined on an individual basis before a decision is made. I understand that a small number of non-nationals are currently serving in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>At the annual delegate conference of PDFORRA in October 2000 the question of targeting recruitment of non-nationals was discussed. The general secretary addressing the conference called on the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to initiate immediate discussions with all interested parties with a view to inviting and attracting non-nationals to join the Defence Forces in return for an accelerated entitlement to citizenship. He also indicated that he wished the issues raised to be considered with a view to presenting details of any scheme to next year's conference for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> In the years ahead our society must become far more open and inclusive. Many existing rules, attitudes and assumptions will have to be challenged as part of this process including the criteria for enlistment in the Defence Forces. I have approached the review with an open mind concerned only to ensure that whatever rules that need to be applied will reflect the realities of the 21st century. However, I caution that the existing rigorous selection procedure and security clearance requirements for enlistment in the Defence Forces will always be applied.</P>
    <P>The question of entitlement to citizenship is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. Officials from my Department are working with the military authorities and with officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the current residency criteria in relation to enlistment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of the sentiments expressed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is a shortfall in the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and the Air Corps, vis-à-vis the trades and professional personnel. Many people who have got work permits in my constituency are undertaking work much of which is below the level at which they are qualified to work. In instances where non-nationals enter the country, I ask that the Department of Defence would look upon these people as a priority to ensure that the vacancies for professional people in the Air Corps, the Naval Service and Department of Defence are filled.</P>
      <P>My understanding of these people coming to work here is that they have been tremendous workers and have fit very well into the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Wall and his colleagues in Kildare. We dedicated McGee Barracks for the time being to Kosovar refugees. There has been significant development there in terms of how the local community and all have worked together.</P>
      <P>At present we have four applications for positions in the Defence Forces. Surprisingly enough, they are not from people from Kosovo. There are two from people from Nigeria and two from Romania. We need to begin to change attitudes in society as a whole. We can look forward to significant changes in that area. In processing these applications we will be as open, generous and fair to those applicants as we will be to any that come to us.</P>
      <P>I do not have any hesitation in encouraging other non-nationals to participate with us in whatever evolves. I assure the Deputy that I will keep in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on developments in that regard.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree he may have to intensify recruitment to encourage <Col N="774" /> people from abroad? His recruitment target last year was 750 and he recruited 625. More than 3,000 people applied and 77% were unsuccessful for a host of reasons. The success factor in the Air Corps was about 8%, in the Naval Service 13% and in the Army 30%.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, in 1994 there were 10,000 applicants for 500 positions. The Celtic Tiger and the availability of other opportunities are responsible for the current scenario. It may be necessary for the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to intensify their efforts and promote the involvement of non-nationals in the Defence Forces, providing they have the necessary security clearance and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy. The recruitment failure rate has to do with people who opted for different choices. To get 650 recruits, with the sheer competition involved last year, was quite an achievement. I accept the Deputy's premise and have had discussions with the Chief of Staff recently about our recruitment programme this year aimed at 1,000 people.</P>
      <P>Though I am loath to use the term &ldquo;new devices&rdquo;, but we must step up the tempo on many fronts to maintain numbers to ensure we can maintain our complement in the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army generally. In that context I undertake to examine to what extent we can accelerate this programme in terms of the recruitment of non-nationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 45, 88, 92, 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The sale of six barracks identified as surplus to military requirements is being progressed. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is the process of being sold to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000 and it is hoped that the formalities of this sale can be completed in the near future. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for £300,000, all for local community purposes. I have recently agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements have commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, that property is in the process of being sold to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000 and it is anticipated that sale contracts will be signed in the near future. Pending completion of the legal and finan<Col N="777" /> cial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board last year on foot of that agreement. A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the largest of the barracks, Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of last year for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork county development plan. Discussions are ongoing between Cork County Council and my Department to determine the best way forward to realise the potential of the integrated plan while taking account of the aspirations of all sides. It is hoped to bring the matter to a conclusion at an early date.</P>
    <P>As regards the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In view of those needs, it has not been possible to arrange for the disposal of the property. However, this matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated in the near future when alternative accommodation becomes available. My Department has advertised a tender competition for the appointment of selling agents to undertake the sale of the barracks of 13.66 acres. The tenders are under examination at present and sale of the property will proceed this year. In addition to the foregoing properties, agreements have also been reached for the sale of the following: 1.07 acres at Arbour Hill to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for £2.5 million; 6.39 acres known as Susan's Field, adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork, to Cork Corporation for £1.2 million; 3.0192 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, to Limerick Corporation for £915,000; 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks to Waterford Corporation for £550,000; 20 acres of the Curragh lands to Kildare County Council for £215,000 to assist with the construction of the Kildare by-pass and 100 married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare, to residents, which will realise £3 million approximately. The disposal of 10 acres at Mellows Field beside Renmore Barracks, Galway, will proceed as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>As indicated, the disposal of barracks is proceeding and it is expected that in excess of £50 million will be realised from the sale of the properties. The money raised will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces. The cost of the barrack re-investment programme is estimated at £50 million. The programme commenced in 1999 and will <Col N="778" /> run until 2003. Provision for this expenditure is being made in my Department's Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Minister hopes to realise £50 million from the sale of the existing barracks. He mentioned other family silver that he sold off in recent times and that amounts to nearly £7 million. Will the £50 million be spent on redeveloping existing barracks? Is any of that currently being spent? Where will the £7 million be spent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that the anticipated money that will accrue to my Department from the sale of these properties will be spent in the receiving barracks, in other words, where a barracks is closed down an accommodating unit would be there. Starting with the Curragh Camp, the following projects are either under way or about to commence: the combat support college, £4.75 million; swimming pool, £4 million; NCOs mess, £1.5 million; refurbishment of wards 3 and 4 hospital, £0.52 million; NCOs dining complex west, £3 million; combat service support college, £1.3 million; Command Headquarters Clarke Barracks, £1.5 million; Connolly Barracks student accommodation, £2.2 million; A and B Blocks Clarke Barracks, £1.4 million and upgrading the lecture hall, £0.5 million. Collins Barracks, Cork, men's new dining hall, £1.7 million; new NCOs mess, £1.37 million; new storage facilities, £2.5 million; new gymnasium and sports hall, £1.6 million; accommodation all ranks £0.8 million. The cost of professional fees for all the developments is about £3 million. Very substantial investment, as well as the normal investment, is being made primarily in those areas because they were significant receivers of big numbers.</P>

      <P>In the case of Orchard Park, I know the problem does not lie with the Department but I ask the Minister to do everything possible to complete the sale of the houses. Although the Minister has tried everything, people still wonder when the deal will go through. As regards Devoy Barracks, Naas, St. David's Boxing Club was a tenant of the Department for many years but it has been left without a premises. Has Devoy Barracks in Naas been sold or is there a possibility of doing something for that club?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he had given lands to local authorities. When one allocation was not acceptable he gave a second allocate to facilitate the local authority in overcoming the major problem <Col N="779" /> which existed. However, there is still a problem with the entrance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>At least Deputy Wall understands the problem. There is local opposition to the new entrance. I tried to accommodate the local authority when it had a difficulty with my earlier allocation. I took on board a further suggestion but this is now embroiled in local dispute. I am sorry about this as there needs to be a better understanding of the problems. There are not many options open to us but we will continue to look at them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is the patron saint of hopeless cases when he suggests that when the deal is closed in Naas there is another part of the area which someone from somewhere has found. I certainly have not been able to find it. I dedicated seven areas to the local authority free of charge, while the rest was sold for a competitive price. That is where the issue rests. We have concluded our work with the Chief State Solicitor's office in the context of the Orchard Park sales. If there is any other stumbling block we will be happy to take it out of the way as we want the sale to proceed, for people to take up ownership of the houses and to see the area improved in tandem with the general improvement of the Curragh.</P>

Will he ensure that the Liam Mellows hurling club which adjoins this property will get the three or four acres it requires to expand its pitches? They do not want it for less than the valuation the Department put on it. Does the Minister have the power to ensure that the club gets this part of the property? The remaining part could then be put up for public auction. Everyone in the area would be satisfied if this was the outcome, as seems to have happened in the other cases to which the Minister referred.</P>

      <P>I want to ensure the greatest flexibility possible in terms of how we manage our financial resources. When the contingent went to Kosovo £6 million was needed for drops so that it could deliver building materials and visit villages which were in trouble in a safe way. I do not rule out any of these possibilities. The money will be used primarily for accommodation.</P>
      <P>When we initiated the programme we wanted community involvement and to dedicate part of the sale of the property or land to the community. I have had discussions with people throughout the country. Notwithstanding the odd row with Galway on the hurling field, sports clubs come first in my mind. The people who organise hurling and other sports deserve every help they can get. I will do my best to give consideration to this proposition in the context of those lands.</P>

      <Quest>if he has reviewed the height requirements for the Defence Forces; the proposals he has to make changes in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I last reviewed the minimum height requirement for entry to the Defence For<Col N="781" /> ces in March 1998. These are set at 165 cm, 5' 5&rdquo;, for males and 162.5 cm, 5' 4&rdquo;, for females. In order to encourage an increased participation by women in the Defence Forces the height requirement for females is set in light of the natural height differential between males and females.</P>
      <P>In setting these height requirements I was mindful of the professional advice of the Defence Forces Medical Corps and the experience of training units that persons of shorter stature encounter greater difficulties in carrying the bulk and weight of combat order equipment. However, I have asked that the matter be reviewed again with a view to ensuring that enlistment to the Defence Forces is open to as many people as possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that Navy personnel do not normally have to carry heavy packs, weights, etc. and that it would be an advantage for Navy personnel to be shorter given the height of the inside of ships? Will he also agree that the height requirement for the Defence Forces should be waived, as was recently done for the Garda Síochána? How many people were refused entry last year because they did not meet the height requirements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the number refused entry last year but it might be interesting to have it checked in the context of how we proceed from here. The height requirement is related to the ergonomics of carrying equipment. I have visited the Glen of Imaal and seen the amount of equipment carried overnight etc. As I have previously admitted, I am no judge of physical strength. All I can say is that during my hurling and football days some of the people who tackled me hardest were considerably smaller than me. I will look seriously at this issue in the broader context of equality, etc. I am not sure if it can be looked at in terms of one section of the Defence Forces as freedom to engage across the services has always existed</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces have been deployed for service with UNIFIL since 1978. On 18 October 2000 the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL for a six month period beginning 30 October 2000 and authorised the Minister for Defence to make preparations for the selection of a further contingent to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in UNIFIL beyond April 2001.</P>
      <P>On 30 January 2000 the UN Security Council extended the UNIFIL mandate to 31 July 2001. In his six monthly report to the Security Council on 22 January 2001, the UN Secretary General stated that two of the three parts of the UNIFIL mandate have essentially now been completed, namely, confirmation of the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and assisting, as far as possible, the Lebanese authorities to return to the vacated area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UNIFIL's focus is now on the remaining part of the mandate which is the restoration of inter<Col N="783" /> national peace and security. This involves patrolling, liaison, close contact with the parties with a view to correcting violations and preventing the escalation of incidents. The Secretary General foresees that the need for the UN to perform such functions will continue to exist in the foreseeable future. He states that these functions are those of an observer mission. However, in view of the conditions in the region the Secretary General is reluctant to entrust the task to unarmed observers alone and recommends a reconfiguration based on a combination of armed infantry and unarmed observers. In this regard he suggests two infantry battalions and a group of United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation observers.</P>
    <P>In view of the situation in the region the Secretary General advises, as a prudent first approach, returning the strength of UNIFIL to that which obtained before it was augmented last year after the Israeli withdrawal which was 4,500 all ranks. The Security Council has tasked him to take the necessary measures to implement this decision by 31 July 2001, taking account of upcoming rotations of battalions in consultation with the Government of Lebanon and the troop contributing countries. Fifty extra Defence Forces personnel deployed to UNIFIL at the request of the UN in June 2000 returned home in October 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The UN Security Council requested the Secretary General to submit a detailed report by 30 April 2001 on UNIFIL's reconfiguration plans and on the tasks that could be carried out by observers as part of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation. On foot of this report the Security Council will review the situation in early May 2001 and will consider any steps it deems appropriate regarding UNIFIL and UNTSO. The Security Council is due to consider the UNIFIL mandate in July 2001.</P>
    <P>The review by the Secretary General in early May 2001 will determine the nature and the level of the force(s) to be deployed in south Lebanon for the longer term. I have indicated on a number of occasions, including during visits to Lebanon and UN headquarters, my desire that the Irish battalion could withdraw from UNIFIL by the end of this year on the basis that UNIFIL's task has largely been completed. However, the six months rotation in April 2001 will take place, unless otherwise requested by the UN, and I propose seeking the approval of the Government to deploy a contingent in April 2001. A battalion is currently in training to this end.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated to the House previously, Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations in relation to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under UNSAS. There would not be any obligation to participate in any <Col N="784" /> given mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>The matter of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review. There exists a standing interdepartmental committee on peacekeeping, under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs whose function, <i>inter alia</i>, is to provide a forum for the exchange of views on policy issues relating to Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping with a view to increasing the effectiveness and coherence of policy in this area and to ensure that policy and its implementation can keep pace in a co-ordinated way with developments in international peacekeeping. The matter of the deployment of units of the Defence Forces overseas is being kept under continual review and in this regard account will be taken of the decisions of the UN Security Council in the coming months in relation to the future of UNIFIL when considering future deployments of contingents of the Defence Forces on missions overseas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The positions of the Secretary General and the Security Council are very clear. They are talking of reducing the complement in the region and having a mixed army and observer force. Last year I indicated that, because of the Israeli withdrawal back to the border, I envisaged that this year would bring an end to Ireland's major participation in south Lebanon which has gone on for 23 years. I will be putting proposals to Government in April for this to be the final contingent.</P>
      <P>Preparation and training has already commenced towards this objective. However, one cannot be certain about what will happen during the rest of the year. We will be consulting with the UN in New York and with our military advisers in south Lebanon on an ongoing basis. As the situation stands, and based on any judgment call I can make and advice I am getting, including from the United Nations, it looks as if this will be the last major contingent to south Lebanon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is talking about this being the last contingent and has mentioned 31 July 2001. The rapid reaction force comes into being on 1 January 2003 with a complement of 850, similar to our UN standby arrangement. Will we have a depleted complement of soldiers serving overseas in the interim period up to 2003? The Minister will recognise the importance of overseas service if people are to be attracted into the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One could not emphasis too strongly the importance of our involvement with UN mandated activities in different parts of the world in terms of training, morale, experience and so on. I was not talking about 31 July but of completing our six months which will be at the end of October 2001. Quite a number of personnel might still be involved as observers after that date.</P>
      <P>I would need at least that amount of time to prepare for whatever additional support could be given to Kosovo or whatever other demands might arise. One would need time to plan for that work. By the middle or end of this year, in the event of this commitment closing, we should be able to decide on other international activities in which we would be engaged. I will be looking to see where that is going to happen.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I will not be idle between the end of our involvement in south Lebanon and whenever a further demand might be made in Europe. Demands are being made of us from many other areas and there is much expectation. We have the capacity to fulfil these demands and are enhancing that capacity with the additional equipment we are purchasing.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time I indicated the importance of this social legislation and its role in promoting labour market stability. I also indicated that successive Governments have enacted legislation in the area of employment rights which reflects changes in society and the workplace at both national and international levels and covers a wide range of areas, including protection against unfair dismissal, payment of wages, organisation of working time, redundancy entitlements and minimum wage entitlements. Significant technological developments, changing lifestyles, well educated workers and a general expectation by people to balance home and working lives have greatly influenced the hours and the way we work over the years.</P>
      <P>The numbers in employment have risen from 1.22 million in 1994 to 1.67 million. Of these, 281,000 are part-time workers. This figure represents an increase of 32,000 since November 1998. Some 75% of these part-time workers are women. That number represents 17% of the total workforce. The influence of part-time working among women increased from 16% of all women at work in 1983 to 23% in 1997. Expectations are that these numbers will continue to increase at that level in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The increase in part-time workers is not exclusive to Ireland. Numbers of part-time workers across the European Union have risen by an average of 14% between 1994 and 1998, with 6% of men in employment and approximately 33% of women working part-time. As part of the member states' annual input into the European Union's employment guidelines and action plans, governments are examining and devising policies aimed at encouraging increased part-time work. This is aimed specifically at addressing skills bottlenecks and encouraging greater participation in the workplace by women, particularly those who have reared their families and would like to get out of the house and back into the workplace.</P>
      <P>Recognising this emerging scenario, the Government introduced a series of measures aimed at encouraging women back into the workplace. These include reduced PAYE levels, the provision by FÁS of a number of courses aimed at improving the skills of workers in the context of the information age &ndash; this is often referred to as lifelong learning &ndash; increased levels of paternity and maternity leave and the introduction last week of the Carer's Leave Bill by the Minister of State. All these measures are already having an effect, as evidenced by the figures I outlined above. They will continue to have a major impact on the labour market in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More can be achieved. We enjoy almost full employment and many facets of enterprise, including State and semi-State bodies, have <Col N="789" /> engaged or encouraged non-nationals to come to Ireland given the current economic climate and the need to fuel the Celtic tiger. I welcome this development as the Minister of State knows from my contact with his Department and from parliamentary questions I have tabled on the need for user friendly systems to be put in place so that people have easy access to work permits. Deputy Boylan knows this is an issue the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has discussed at length with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. We all appreciate the benefits of a multi-cultural society. However, I remain to be convinced that we have the necessary infrastructure, given that 200,000 to 300,000 overseas participants will be required in the next number of years. I am not convinced we have the housing units, the rented accommodation, the public transport network, the hospitals and the other vital supports to accommodate such numbers.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous opportunity to tap into the fund of wealth and experience available among people who are forced to leave their workplace at a young age, for example, members of the Garda Síochána. Any reasonably minded person, regardless of their age, would acknowledge that a person aged in their mid-50s &ndash; the nearer I get to that age barrier, the younger it seems &ndash; and of the calibre and integrity of a member of the Garda Síochána has still a great role to play in the workplace. Many other groups of people may not wish to remain in full-time work. An incentive should be put in place to encourage such retired people to continue to participate in the workplace at whatever level they may decide. I have put my ideas on this matter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and I understand that the matter is under consideration. We should encourage retired people to participate in the workplace but this is not happening, particularly for those who may have paid contributions at source all their working lives. Now that they are working to remain active and participate, they still see PAYE and RSI deductions from their pay slips at the end of the week. The RSI deduction could be the health levy and may not be the full RSI rate, particularly for those over 65, but incentives should be put in place regarding such stoppages on people who have contributed all their working lives.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House know people who are working part-time, in many instances for their own sons or daughters. Those involved in such work are unhappy with the current procedures, especially relating to Revenue and RSI. Because of that, they may not be able to participate, or show their participation, in the way they wish. I would like to hear from groups with an interest in this area, including the older network groups, such as age and opportunity and others, that do great work and give encouragement in our society.</P>
    <P>I regret that the following matter was brought to my attention by an eminent consultant working <Col N="790" /> in age related health care. In a letter dated 11 February headed &ldquo;re: Ageism&rdquo;, he quotes from one of the national Sunday newspapers. His letter states:</P>
    <P>You may have read a piece on the front page of [and he quotes the name of the newspaper] of 11 February, by [and he quotes the author] which takes an outrageous, prejudicial view of older people and older people's organisations. It also trivialises the efforts of the older people's organisations and the Equality Authority to counteract the enormous, prevalent scourge of ageism in our society. This ageism is a barrier preventing older people from participating fully in our society. It also undermines their access to appropriate health care and equity of income.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that if the language and use of negative stereotypes in this article were used in other areas there would be justifiable outrage. I concur with that view. I read the article myself and I was perturbed by it. I am pleased to say that following the communication I have received, I will be pursuing the matter with the appropriate authorities. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is aware of my interest in this regard. I have briefly mentioned to him the question of providing opportunities for older people who wish to participate in the workforce, along the lines of the proposal I have put to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. I have also raised this matter at the parliamentary party meeting so my views are clearly known. We can easily address the issue of ageism and I look forward to having the opportunity of raising this and related issues in greater detail with the Minister. I would encourage network groups for older people to write either to myself or to the Minister so that any issues they wish to raise can be given due consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to implement the provisions of EC Directive 97/81 of the Council of the European Union concerning the framework agreement on part-time work concluded by the general cross-industry organisations at European level: UNICE, the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe, CREEP, the European Centre of Enterprise with Public Participation, and ETOS, the European Trade Union Confederation.</P>
    <P>The directive's main provisions are to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers, to improve the quality of part-time work, to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and workers. The scope of the directive is expressed as applying to part-time workers who have an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by law, collective agreement or practice in each member state. In this context, Irish labour law covers persons <Col N="791" /> employed under contracts of service and agency workers.</P>
    <P>The directive provides that, after consultation with the social partners, member states may, for objective reasons, provide for the exclusion, wholly or partly, from the provisions of part-time workers who work on a casual basis. Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on why such an exclusion is provided for in this section? I note that it was after consultation with the social partners, but I would like further clarification exactly why there should be provision for the exclusion, wholly or partly, from the proposals of part-time workers who work on a casual basis.</P>
    <P>The directive requires the implementation in member states of measures guaranteeing that part-time workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers. It also requires the removal of discrimination against part-time workers where such exists, and contains measures aimed at improving the quality of part-time work, which we all welcome.</P>
    <P>I do not intend going into the Bill in much more detail as the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has already outlined various aspects of the legislation in great detail. However, the provisions of the Bill are generally influenced by the terms of the directive to which I have referred. In addition, I understand that detailed discussions have taken place with the social partners, ICTU and IBEC, and both support the intent of the Bill. ICTU and IBEC have raised a number of issues, mainly of a technical nature, which are being considered and which we can discuss further on Committee Stage. I have listened to the debate intently and I note that Deputies have raised a number of important issues which can also be considered on Committee Stage. With suitable compromise we can improve the content of the Bill even further. It behoves us to move quickly and ensure the early passage of the Bill through both Houses. As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I am pleased to inform the House that, subject to the approval of the Bill on Second Stage, I will facilitate its early discussion in committee, in consultation with both convenors, Deputies Boylan and McGuinness.</P>
    <P>There are 181,000 part-time workers in the workforce who are waiting for their entitlements to be set down on a statutory basis by this legislation. By doing so, this House will be sending a clear signal to part-time workers of the increasingly important role they are playing in our society both within and outside the workplace. I am happy to commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I have read the Bill and various related documentation and have read the Minister's contribution in detail. The Minister said the main objectives of the directive, which is enshrined in this Bill, are to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers, to improve the quality of part-time work, to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and workers. I know the Minister will forgive me if I have to express scepticism about this Bill enshrining what the Minister states are the main objectives of the directive.</P>
      <P>When replying to the Second Stage debate, I would like him to be much more specific about what changes this will make to the life, working environment and working conditions of part-time workers. The Bill does not spell out with any clarity what advances it provides over and above what is enshrined in existing legislation. I am sceptical that this is simply a bit of window dressing making perhaps some minor changes. I would like the Minister to state very clearly and in concrete terms what his legislation means to the workers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister really only highlighted one specific thing in regard to pensions. He said: &ldquo;In this context, one area of the Bill that I would like to specifically mention is that of pension entitlements of part-time workers.&rdquo;  He went on to detail that but that was the only specific issue he <Col N="793" /> mentioned. He then went through the technicalities of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think it is very ignorant that the Minister be engaged in conversation by a Member of the House when another Member is speaking and addressing the Minister. I am trying to make serious points.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Minister gave some interesting statistics &ndash; fittingly, I think &ndash; as an introduction to his speech today. There are 281,00 part-time workers, which is 17% of the workforce. In 1997, 75% of those workers were women. An astonishing projection is that by 2005, there may be up to 0.5 million part-time workers in the economy. I would like the Minister to state how many of the 281,000 workers are specifically affected by and whose living conditions will be improved as a result of this legislation. I hope I will be in the Dáil for his reply but if not, it will be on the record for examination. How many of the 281,000 are excluded by virtue of this legislation on the basis of the eight hours per week threshold or the 13 weeks per year threshold? How many of the projected 0.5 million will be excluded? </P>
      <P>My concern is that although the Minister says the objectives of the directive are to improve the quality of part-time work and to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis, the experience so far has been that, in many cases, employers use part-time work and treat part-time workers in quite a ruthless manner. In 1997, there was a very bitter strike involving workers from Dunnes Store who were obliged to engage in industrial action on the basis of zero hours contracts. It reflected an increasing trend among employers, including large-scale employers, where part-time working conditions suited them, to insist on zero hours contracts. Effectively, they were trying to create a large pool of part-time workers who could be called on morning, noon or night at the whim of the employer. It had got to the stage where employers insisted that these workers, with no guaranteed minimum payment, be at the end of a telephone to be called and told to get to their place of work at one hour's notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have welcomed it if the Minister had used the opportunity to enshrine the EU directive in legislation to deal with some of these issues because he and other speakers have spoken about trying to make part-time work more attractive for workers so that more people are available, etc. While we have employers taking advantage of part-time workers, who are largely unorganised <Col N="794" /> as far as the trade union movement goes, we have a major contradiction. I fear that this Bill does not really deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>A thought that came to me as I studied the Bill was that along with the secretarial colleagues Deputies have who work hard on our legislative proposals as well as on our constituency and other work, is that there is an increasing need to be given legal expertise in order to come to grips with some of the convoluted provisions and definitions within a Bill such as this. Part 2, section 7(1), which sets out what a part-time employee means, states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;part-time employee&rdquo; means an employee whose normal hours of work are less than the normal hours of work of an employee who is a comparable employee in relation to him or her;</P>
    <P>The next page of the Bill tries to define an employee <i>vis-à-vis</i> a comparable employee. Why can we not have a simple statement. A part-time employee is a worker who is not in full-time employment. I am not aware of the reason for it. Notwithstanding the fact that part-time employees must not be treated less favourably than full-time employees, section 9(2) states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to <i>section 11(2),</i> if treating a part-time employee, in respect of a particular condition of employment, in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee can be justified on objective grounds then that employee may, notwithstanding <i>subsection (1),</i> be so treated.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister spell out precisely what that means? I fear we have an escape hatch here for the most difficult type of employer, recalcitrant and mean employers, who will want to find escape clauses from the full rigours of any legislation that might protect the rights of workers. What does &ldquo;justification on objective grounds&rdquo; mean? Given that it is not defined in the Bill there is an onus on the Minister to spell it out. A previous speaker gave an example &ndash; it is one which occurred to me &ndash; of substitute teachers as opposed to full-time teachers. Does it mean that the employer can gather together spurious objective grounds or create objective grounds through some devices to discriminate and treat part-time employees less favourably? Certainly this Bill is wide open to that.</P>
    <P>Section 11(4) deals with part-time employees who work on a casual basis. Why is it necessary to include this subsection? Why should a worker who works less than eight hours per week or works 13 weeks per year not be protected in the same way as any other part-time worker? Why make such a distinction? There is disturbing evidence that employers can legally dismiss a person before the end of 13 weeks and thereby evade their responsibilities under this legislation. There is disturbing evidence of immigrant workers who have their working conditions and even their employment and employers changed without their consent. I am not happy with that situation. <Col N="795" /> A simple Bill providing for all workers is what should be brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I was curious to hear a number of Deputies from the major parties speak particularly about the position of women, since women form such a major part of the cohort of part-time workers. If I could take them seriously I would, perhaps, have been impressed. I am referring to some male speakers from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The record of those parties in some cases has been particularly shameful in failing women who have found themselves highly discriminated against. The case of the home helps in the health boards was an acute case of scandalous treatment of women workers. In 1997 &ndash; it is hard to credit it today &ndash; £1.40 per hour was paid by the Southern Health Board on which was represented all the main political parties in the Republic. That continued for many years and not one of them cried stop until those women organised themselves for decent wages and conditions. I am proud to say this was with the active support of the Socialist Party in Cork and our representative, Michael Barry. Through their own action and militancy, all health boards have to pay £6.50 per hour. It was not done by the charity of the main political parties&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I agree fully with Deputy Barnes in that regard. That is a worse scandal. I urge the leadership of the trade union movement to go on a crusade of recruitment of part-time workers who are being neglected. The trade union leadership who are too tied in with the Government and employers, and part of the establishment unfortunately, is forgetting the basics of trade unionism. The basis of trade unionism is that part-time workers are among the most vulnerable in society and should be drawn into the ranks by having demonstrated to them the benefits of trade unionism by virtue of an active campaign by the trade union leaders on their behalf. The attitude of some leaders is that it is a bit awkward having part-time workers and it is messy etc. etc.</P>
      <P>The home helps in the Southern Health Board are in the courts fighting the health board to get holiday pay entitlements to which they should be entitled by virtue of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991. They have to take a State agency to the court to get their rights. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will take note of that and ask the Southern Health Board to concede that case immediately as it is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the boom in the economy, perhaps conditions for part-time workers are slightly more favourable to workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> employers. We have to prepare for a situation when the US recession begins to blow on this economy and workers can be in a less favourable position where employers <Col N="796" /> can pick and choose. That is what we have to prepare for when legislation is being enacted. In the context of this Bill which deals with part-time workers, it is a pity that the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill which we have discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, in the committee is so weak in regard to granting trade union rights to workers. Given that the Government refuses to enshrine recognition of trade unions as mandatory in the law of the land that would be a concrete gain for part-time workers. Tá mo chuid ama istigh, agus dá bhrí sin beidh níos mó le rá agam ar an mBille ar na céimeanna eile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State for introducing this Bill. It is a technical Bill in so far as it implements the provisions of EU Directive 97/81/EC of the Council of European Communities concerning the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by general union and industry organisations at European level, including UNIC, CEEP and ETUC. The Bill is very important because it aims to remove discrimination against part-time workers where such exists. It also seeks to improve the quality of part-time work to facilitate the development of such work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes account of the needs of both employers and workers. It also guarantees that part-time workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Bill is of more significance to me than I would like because there are probably more part-time than full-time workers in my constituency. I would like to see that redressed. I hope the Bill will encompass all workers. Deputy Joe Higgins outlined the improvements he wishes to see implemented, although he also extended a back handed compliment to the Minister of State when he acknowledged that workers today are better protected. In saying this I do not underestimate the seriousness of his points on the home help issue. For many years people involved in home help have been treated as if they were part of a charitable organisation rather than as workers. It is right and fair that they should be properly recognised.</P>
      <P>The skills shortage at national level has drawn increasing numbers into part-time working. This Bill is part of a number of measures the Government has introduced in an attempt to make entry to the work force family friendly. The provisions on maternity, including unpaid leave, and parental leave introduced in the budget, and the provisions in the Carer's Leave Bill represent significant improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people in my constituency will not be covered by this legislation. For example, many in the marine sector are part-time because of the nature of the work and the conditions, such as the weather. Yet, when they are unable to fish they probably do not get as much support as they are entitled to. Perhaps the Minister would consult with the Minster for the Marine and Natural <Col N="797" /> Resources and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs with a view to addressing this aspect.</P>
    <P>Many of those involved in on-shore work, whether it be in aquaculture, fish filleting or the added value sector have not had as fair a deal as they could have. I hope the provisions in the Bill will assist them. Many problems have arisen in the marine sector in terms of supports. In addition, many of those involved in textiles have been involved in job loses. This is the case not only in respect of Fruit of the Loom but in Moville, Carndonagh, Buncrana, Raphoe, Lifford and elsewhere in my constituency. Before being made redundant people were moved to part-time work. While many employees wanted a full-time job there was an advantage in working part-time, especially as it meant that people with young families could spend time with them while earning a decent wage. I am disappointed that Third World labour can be so much cheaper and that others elsewhere are being exploited at a time when this legislation seeks to ensure that nobody in this country is exploited.</P>
    <P>Tourism has great potential in a constituency like mine. Part-time working in the industry could be further developed to the point where people could be employed full-time, especially if peace continues in the North. This is the first of many years where the calm has been such that the tourism industry might have a chance to develop. In that regard I welcome the allocation by the Minister for Finance of funding alongside area five funding for a car ferry from Magilligan Port to Greencastle and from Buncrana to Rathmullan. This will provide accessibility to the north-west of the County Donegal, which will give a chance for people to take up part-time and full-time employment.</P>
    <P>Part-time work should always be available. It is good to ensure the household incomes can be subsidised in this way. It provides an opportunity for spouses to participate in the work force, for both economic and social reasons while enabling them to be at home for family time. In this regard the Government has done much to facilitate family friendly working. For example, part-time workers have been assisted by tax measures in the budget. For many years extra money was highly taxed, so there is a need to continue to improve the position of part-time workers because they are at the hub of many families and are central to meeting the demands of the labour skills shortages.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to look at the position of those involved in CE schemes. They are engaged in valuable work for their communities, have acquired a sense of self worth and contribute significantly to those they work for. Every community is better for having a CE scheme. I hold strong views on this because there are people who, for one reason or another, may have been on long-term unemployment when they reach the age of 40 or 45 years and who will not get full-time or part-time work. Even if they get <Col N="798" /> part-time work they could continue to do good work on a CE scheme. The Minister of State should give serious consideration to providing for experienced, perhaps professional, CE personnel. For example, I know from my own area that thousands of small jobs need to be done in every town and village, whether it be in community sport fields or elsewhere. People involved in these schemes provide this vital service in the absence of an alternative. There is a need to make permanent those involved in such schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for being parochial when I say my area of Inishowen needs greater employment, both part-time and full-time. There has only been intermittent replacements of the litany of companies that have closed recently and that have moved elsewhere to exploit other labour forces. I will not go through the litany of closures that have taken place but I must thank the county council for its initiatives, which cannot be under-estimated. It has been the driving force in trying to bring work back into the area. I thank Enterprise Ireland for its substantial support to existing industries, not just it terms of expertise, but in relation to advice and its work to try to attract new industries to the area.</P>
    <P>I ask the IDA to try to step up its efforts in relation to County Donegal, particularly my area where thousands of jobs have been lost. I thank the Government for our Objective One status which has given us a chance to create employment. I do not think any other political party was in favour of dividing the country in relation to Objective One status.</P>

      <P>The Border Deputies may have supported it but whether the party leaders supported it is another aspect. I recall my party leader, when in Opposition, promising he would do what others were not favourably disposed to do. That status gives us favourable grant aid, therefore there is no excuse for not investing in the area. Things are not all bleak. There is the expansion of Atlanfish, which is doing very well. These types of jobs rely on seasonal factors for their development and I wish the company well. The shirt factory in Moville has risen like a phoenix and has been able to re-adapt itself with the help of Enterprise Ireland. Many of these jobs have been secured. I am pleased that community groups in places like Moville and Carndonagh are developing units so they can set up their new industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the new technology park at Lisfannon, which is working very well, Clubman Omega's expansion into Carndonagh and Forward Emphasis in Malin. There are more positive than negative aspects in relation to Donegal. Network365, the County Wicklow based e-commerce software solutions provider, announced on Monday that it will locate its research and development centre in Letterkenny. This will lead to the <Col N="799" /> employment of 30 software developers by the end of the year. The new advanced research and design centre, which is allied to the company's offices in Japan and Scandinavia, is representing a global initiative behind Network365 to lead the world in mobile commerce software solutions. The software engineers who will work at the new centre will use cutting edge technologies to build the world's most advanced wireless platforms. This indicates that we have the facilities and ability to look after companies who locate in Donegal. It is one of the best, friendliest and environmentally friendly counties in which to locate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the infrastructural developments in Buncrana. I also welcome the Government's injection of £5.6 million into Derry city airport, which has got the Dublin-Derry airlink off the ground. I welcome the ferry development which will help tourism. We have the potential to create more part-time and full-time employment. There is no excuse for anyone within the State agencies, in particular, not to deliver on this issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins that the United States' economy is not as vibrant as it was but perhaps it is not on a complete slippery slope at the moment. Given our Celtic tiger economy, if industries are not located in Donegal when times are good, there will not be much hope of this happening when times are not so good. Therefore, I use every opportunity to outline the advantages for workers and employment in Donegal. While this is very important legislation to protect part-time workers, I hope that together with much more part-time employment, we will be dealing with the protection of full-time employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join previous speakers in welcoming the Bill which gives us an opportunity to debate this complex and wide ranging issue. I have no doubt the Minister of State's heart is in the right place but I doubt if the Bill is the answer to all the anomalies that will be thrown up as a result of part-time work. To try to make common sense in layman's terms of what is in the Bill will be difficult, therefore, it will be fodder for the legal eagles over many years as they try to tease out the various complexities of the Bill. To me, part-time work means part of a day, part of the night or part of the week. It is worth reading sections 9(1) and 10(1) to try to make sense of them. Section 9(1) relating to conditions of employment for part-time employees reads, &ldquo;Subject to <i>subsections (2)</i> and <i>(4)</i> and <i>section 11(2),</i> a part-time employee shall not, in respect of his or her conditions of employment, be treated in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee.&rdquo;  Section 10(1) in relation to proportionate provision of certain conditions of employment, reads, &ldquo;The extent to which any condition of employment referred to in <i>subsection (2)</i> is provided to a part-time employee for the purposes of complying with <i>section 9(1)</i> shall be related to the proportion <Col N="800" /> which the normal hours of work of that employee bears to the normal hours of work of the comparable full-time employee concerned.&rdquo;  The legal people will have a field day, they will try for hours in court to tease out these two sections.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Callely, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, that when the Minister of State attends the committee there will be an opportunity for a question and answer session to tease out this whole area. This is an important discussion on what is not a new development. However, the development is wide ranging in that part-time work is now more applicable to more people, particularly young housewives, who have young children and who are under pressure to provide a home and buy a car. Many housewives decide to take up part-time work so we must be definitive about what constitutes part-time work. Perhaps when a housewife leaves the children off at school, there is an opportunity to rush down to the local supermarket, hotel or restaurant to work for a number of hours. That is part-time work. She may give the children to another woman who looks after them part-time. Young people work in pubs, restaurants, as petrol pump attendants, car wash bay attendants and so on. Housewives, young people and others work in supermarkets on a part-time basis. What conditions, terms and protections have these people who are entitled to protection? Of course they are grateful for the employment and extra income but it also suits the employer to employ them. However, if these people are doing a good job, they cannot be told at the whim of the employer that they are no longer needed. Likewise, the employee should not think he can come and go as he pleases.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there is now almost full employment. Employees now have an opportunity to change jobs, which is welcome. Everyone is entitled to improve his lot in life if he believes he might be happier in another position. However, there must be ground rules and some understanding so that business and living can exist side by side. People are coming here from third world countries, some of whom I have met. Many of these people are excellent workers who must also be protected. However, they cannot take up the part-time jobs of our own people. A group of marvellous people from Romania told me that they will work all the hours God sends them. It is great to see it but I would not like to see them abused in such a way that they must work from dawn until dusk, even if they would get the minimum wage. They could also be taking this type of employment from Irish people who would need it. There has to be regulation and an understanding that there is a place for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's leave legislation which was before the House last week is extremely important and relevant to this legislation. It will give an opportunity to people to look after the people who brought this country through poorer times to its current level of development. There is also flexi-time which affords another opportunity to people <Col N="801" /> to do a few hours work to make the necessary income for their families. There might even be a schoolgoing child working flexi-time at the weekend. There are also home helps who do marvellous work. Do they come within the remit of this legislation? They travel to help out in a household where, perhaps, the young person must go out to work. It is part-time work which generates necessary income. There is also casual labour where somebody is available to do various jobs as they arise. It is generally menial but important work, such as tidying up the supermarket or working on a large building site.</P>
    <P>These are areas where there should be ground rules so people will know where they stand. After a number of years of part-time work they should have some pension rights and recognition for their work. I have read the Bill but it is difficult to comprehend. Perhaps a more understandable document will be made available.</P>

      <P>I knew the Minister had his heart in the right place and that he would not try to fool us. The Minister will take responsibility for that. I am not downgrading the officials; they have their job to do.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill which will benefit many people. Part-time work is part and parcel of life. I welcome the development of a major new industry in my county. Terradyne is an American company. These large American companies work 24 hours a day through the use of 12 hour shifts. Intel in Leixlip operates shifts from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. The worker works three days on and four days off followed by four days on and three days off. However, it might suit a person to work from 7 p.m. to 12 midnight or from 12 midnight to 7 a.m. That would be considered part-time work; it is not the full 12 hour shift. The companies are prepared to take people on to work those hours but those employees should be protected. They have rights and, although they are not working a full shift, they are working for a period of time over a number of years and there should be recognition for that work and the contribution they make. There should also be insurance and pension rights available to them.</P>
      <P>There is also reference in the Bill to people taking early retirement. I cannot understand anybody retiring from work other than for health reasons. One hears people say: &ldquo;Thank God, I will soon be retiring&rdquo;, but they must not be happy in their jobs. I would be happy to continue as a Deputy but I do not have a say in that.</P>

      <P>We have to go before a tribunal every five years and the people decide. People who retire at 50 or 55 years could still make a <Col N="802" /> contribution. It is sad in many ways that they decide to retire. I have spoken to people who did it and they have often regretted it. They thought it would be great to have time on their hands. However, they are usually available for part-time work and would like to get back into the workforce. There is nothing wrong with that and they should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Other speakers will be anxious to contribute to this debate. It is an interesting and important discussion and I look forward to teasing out further aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many complex issues involved in the Bill and I will not be able to discuss all of them in the time available. The objectives of the Bill are to stop the exploitation of part-time workers and, equally important, to provide flexibility so people can take up vacancies that cannot be filled at present.</P>
      <P>I have seen how things have changed over my last 20 years in this House. For the first 15 of those 20 years our problem was creating full-time jobs, regardless of how we managed it. Now there has been a sea change and it even affects rural areas, the areas that are most familiar to me. Flexibility is everything. People want to be able to work outside the normal structure of employment. For years a normal job consisted of a five day working week with working hours from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. If the person could not fit into that structure, they did not get the job. Now, employers are prepared to do almost anything to get the staff they need.</P>
      <P>The strange new phenomenon in this country &ndash; it is not a new phenomenon in other developed countries &ndash; is that the number of part-time workers has rocketed. There were 107,000 part-time workers three years ago. The figure is now 280,000 and I do not doubt that it will be even higher in two or three years, provided we can find extra pools of labour from which we can draw.</P>
      <P>There is scope for finding new labour on the live register. We talk about full employment but many things can be done to encourage people out of unemployment. It would be a useful exercise if various Departments worked in a co-ordinated manner to get people off the live register, for a variety of reasons. I will return to this later.</P>
      <P>Between 70% and 80% of the huge increase in part-time workers is due to the number of women who have returned to the workplace in one form or another. Everybody is aware of that fact. The problem is, however, that there is a huge suspicion that these women do not have many rights. If anything should happen, they will be the first to go. They are the front line troops, as such. The guarantees they are offered that their rights will be protected are not actually believed by many people. If one loses one's part-time job in the local garden centre, supermarket or mart, I doubt that there will be anything more than crodocile tears to help them. I am not sure that this Bill will do much to help them either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> I see the Bill as an enabling measure, an all-embracing concept of the legislation already on the Statute Book. I will refer to the Bill's provisions shortly but I have not heard anything during this debate which would, if I were a part-time worker, lead me to believe that I will be any safer in my job tomorrow than I was yesterday. If that is the case, the Bill misses its objective. However, we will allow the system to develop until we see what results from it.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the training Bill, we talked about the new concept of training. Obviously, there will have to be massive retraining. In fairness to successive Governments, they took the training issue seriously. We are gradually approaching the American concept. The US was the first place I saw people holding up to three jobs at one time, the nature of which was usually entirely different and required people to undergo three types of training. That kind of flexibility has obviously served the US economy well and it is a concept to which we are gradually coming around. I was reared in the belief that a person took a job on leaving school or college and kept it until retirement. Fortunately or unfortunately, as the case may be, that day is gone. Young people, including members of my own family, do not really know what they want to do on leaving college and can change jobs at the drop of a hat in our tiger economy. However, such flexibility means people have to be retrained. Young people do not have any difficulty, having spent three or four years at university, spending a further year undergoing in-house training. That is a very helpful attitude.</P>
    <P>The child care sector is a huge and expensive growth area and we must be careful to avoid exploitation therein. Child care provision is not a simple task. Parents expect high standards in return for which they must pay a high price. The nature of child care provision makes it eminently suitable for part-time work.</P>
    <P>There are now more job descriptions and specifications in the health care sector than there are letters in the alphabet. Some of the jobs are good and others are less so. We must be careful to ensure that people working in this sector, particularly in a part-time capacity, are properly treated.</P>
    <P>What provisions, if any, are contained in the Bill in regard to the protection of school children under a certain age who work part-time in pubs, supermarkets, hotels, etc., due to their desire to earn their own money? Does this Bill specify the dangers of such employment? The Minister will be aware that there comes a stage in young people's lives where the prospect of earning sizeable sums of money sometimes outweighs their desire to pursue their education and careers. I do not doubt that some of these young people are being exploited and would like to know what impact the Bill may have in this area. The Minister may tell me that this is a matter for parents and teachers, not legislators. However, it is akin <Col N="804" /> to our liquor laws into which the State, of necessity, has a huge input. I am extremely concerned about the position of under-age workers and feel that it is deteriorating steadily. Children can now earn sums of money which they have never previously handled and there are myriad outlets in which they can spend their income. We must call a halt in this area because huge problems are emerging.</P>
    <P>The live register is a valuable reserve of potential employees, although I acknowledge that a great deal of retraining would be required to make some people employable. People's attitudes must change and some people must be taken by the hand through what is a slow process. Some of the people on the live register genuinely want to work but require assistance to take the initial step forward. The Minister will be very familiar with this from his own constituency. It is extraordinarily difficult for people from a household in which the members of two generations have never worked to decide to take up part-time work because they will be afraid that they will lose their entitlements. Aside from the work being carried out by county development boards, etc., a huge emphasis must be placed on encouraging several thousands of the people on the live register to take up employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan and others raised issues in regard to retirement. Some countries have increased the official retirement age at which people will be eligible for a full pension and provide a partial retirement pension to older employees who wish to work part time. Incentives are also offered to businesses to retain employees for a longer period of time. I am not aware of the Government's view on this matter but I assume it considers it socially unacceptable to increase the retirement age. There would be a national outcry if that were to happen. People work hard for 40 years of their lives and expect to receive a pension on reaching a certain age.</P>
    <P>Older people have a great deal of good sense and professionalism to offer although they may lack some fire in their bellies having done the same job for 40 years. These people have a great deal of experience and it should be possible for them to obtain their retirement pension &ndash; which should be set in stone &ndash; and supplement it through any income earned on returning to the workforce. Many men and women would welcome that. They would be highly motivated employees and would appreciate their work being recognised. A demand certainly exists for their skills.</P>
    <P>In regard to the organisation of working time legislation which deals with holidays, rest periods, night work, safety, etc., it is interesting to note the changes which have occurred over the years. In 1930, people worked a maximum of 55 hours per week. The figure now stands at 48 and is decreasing steadily.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney referred to participants on FÁS and CE schemes who do very valuable work. As Deputy Keaveney rightly said, and I could not <Col N="805" /> have said it better myself, there is much work yet to be done throughout the country. It may not be commercial work because if it were there would be money to be made out of it and somebody would already have it done, and the county councils and the corporations do not have the money to do it. They have gone away from that over the past few years. From the point of view of the national economy, and particularly tourism, it is hugely important that we continue that programme.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the daftness of what is going on, in the little village of Caherlistrane, outside Tuam, which the Minister knows well, there is the best workmanship I have ever seen. Admittedly it is only a stone wall but the way it is designed and its location changes the character of the village in a very positive way. The people involved in that scheme went to the trouble of travelling around the country to get the type of stone that was in keeping with the character of the area. They had various local raffles, etc., to get this scheme going, and they did that. However, the Tánaiste, and whoever else was with her, decided last April that there would be a major change in this scheme and as a result there is a half built wall in Caherlistrane. It is now much worse than it was when they started. There are 15 people trained to build the wall. Nobody else in the area can build it, yet the FÁS office in Tuam told me that because of what has happened at Government level, they cannot touch the wall for almost another year. What is even worse, most of the people who participated in the scheme will not be eligible the next time.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Mr. Roddy Molloy, the four Galway TDs met him recently on this issue and I have to compliment him because he certainly seemed to understand what we were trying to do but I always understood that once legislation was brought in, it applied to everyone. Like my other colleagues, I have a bag full of applications for social employment schemes from the sponsoring committees but I have been told, and I have to accept it because that is the way I operate, that because of the changes made last April, it is not possible to commence them. However, four or five schemes have commenced which obviously did not come under the legislation or the conditions of the schemes. I am delighted for those people. I made representations on their behalf and I am not the only one who did that &ndash; the Minister of State knows about whom I am talking &ndash; but I will want an answer shortly why four or five groups can get through and 24 or 25 cannot. What is the determining factor in that regard? I would like the Minister to raise that issue with the Tánaiste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly pursue all those issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have equality in the way we apply the rules. I want to go back to the position pre-April of last year. I believe a genuine mistake was made and if Mr. Roddy <Col N="806" /> Molloy, can implement changes to better the scheme, we will be delighted with that but we certainly will not stand for schemes being prioritised, for whatever reason, at the expense of everybody else. I want to know the reasons for that. I will not mention the schemes today but I will come into this House in the not too distant future and name them because I find it difficult to go back to the people who contacted me, and indeed other public representatives, and tell them that the rules will not allow them to start a scheme when five miles up the road a scheme started a few weeks ago under the same conditions. If there is a ruling it should be the same for all. It is against that background I would like the Minister of State to check that matter out for me.</P>
      <P>I had many other comments to make. I hope the Bill will do what it sets out to do but we would certainly like the Minister's help with the matters I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill although I accept the fact, as pointed out by my colleague, Deputy Naughten, that it is overdue.</P>
      <P>The Irish business sector has undergone a remarkable transformation in the 1990s. Private sector non-agricultural employment has increased by 400,000, or over 50%, in the past decade. Almost 80% of employment growth has come from indigenous companies, much of it in the manufacturing or service sectors in my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
      <P>In the more open global marketplace where Ireland must now compete, competitiveness will be more important than ever before. We must protect the competitor strengths we have carefully built up. Despite our economic success, however, Ireland still has exhibited certain structure weaknesses. A small open economy must be more flexible than its competitors to succeed. It must anticipate and master change and build on its long-term competitiveness on the basis of high skills, innovation, quality and flexibility. This is a route to high paid employment which Ireland must take.</P>
      <P>The Government failed to meet its commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to give 270,000 part-time workers new rights to pensions, holidays and other entitlements. This legislation was due to be presented in June but is only now before the House. As a result, part-time workers have lost 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill replaces the 1990 legislation under which part-time employees have to work at least eight hours per week for 13 weeks to be eligible for protection. Only a fraction of part-time employees, therefore, benefit from it. The new Bill is expected to cover most of the 280,000 people classified as part-time workers as it does not provide for an hourly or weekly threshold, except in regard to pension entitlements. When it becomes law it will entitle part-time workers to occupational pensions, holiday pay, sick leave and other benefits, all of which are important, on the same basis as full-time employees. They will <Col N="807" /> also be covered in respect of unfair dismissals, minimum notice and redundancy.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, the ratio of part-time workers has increased from one in 15 of the workforce to one in eight. The reality today is that both parents have to work to pay a mortgage and it is important that the person who wants to look after the children, be it male or female, has the opportunity to do part-time work if necessary.</P>
    <P>On the issue of child care, Fine Gael proposes five key steps, two local and three national, which must be taken in this area. Local authority planning guidelines should facilitate the provision of child care in residential areas. It is wrong for planning authorities to insist that a house in a residential area cannot be used as a crèche for children in the immediate locality. In my own home town, a child lost his life on the road so it is important that we have these facilities in the local area. Unused primary school rooms should be franchised for the purpose of child care provision in after school hours. Child benefit payment should be significantly increased for children under five years of age and a smaller increase should be provided for children between the ages of five and ten.</P>
    <P>What would guarantee equal treatment of all children, be they in receipt of paid child care or care in the home by a parent, grandparent or relative? Paid child care should not be a privilege over unpaid child care or <i>vice versa.</i> Not long ago, a group of us saw the situation in Finland where 70% of the children were looked after by the state in terms of child care.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion in recent months regarding part-time teachers, an issue which also concerns children. We need more teaching staff who can deal with all the problems in the education sector. Temporary unqualified teachers perform the same duties as their permanent counterparts, yet there is a discrepancy in terms of remuneration. Will the Bill resolve the current problem? Furthermore, what impact will the legislation have on so-called unqualified substitute teachers, many of whom have the same qualifications, or are more qualified, than permanent teachers? There are more problems in this regard in Border areas with teachers from across the Border who do not necessarily meet all our qualifications, taking up posts. Because they do not have the requirements in Irish, they are severely discriminated against in terms of remuneration, earning just half the salary of those doing the same job but who have Irish. Will this be defined as &ldquo;objective grounds&rdquo; under the legislation? Will the provisions in the Bill deal with the difficulties in the sector?</P>
    <P>Farmers are also being forced into part-time employment, particularly as a result of the BSE crisis. There is no doubt that if the rules being proposed by the Commission are allowed come to fruition, there will be a major exodus of farmers from the livestock sector. While in general terms the measures will be welcomed by the <Col N="808" /> farming community, where part-time work helps to support small holdings, there can be serious implications for farmers working part-time if this is brought to the attention of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the European Commission. The main problem is exclusion from certain EU sponsored schemes. For example, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development debars applications from farmers for the EU early retirement scheme who are found to be engaged in part-time work for a period prior to their application. At the same time the Commission, through a directive, is attaching great significance to the need for proper provision of social security and pensions for part-time workers. This seems to be a contradiction in terms of pension entitlements. Farmers with holdings of 15 to 16 hectares, who must supplement their incomes with off-farm work to survive, are currently being discriminated against. Surely, it was to such farmers that schemes such as the early retirement scheme were directed. Furthermore, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development excludes these part-time workers from certain premium payments by making an assessment against them on the basis of their off-farm incomes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will address these issues in his response as on the one hand the EU is talking about promoting part-time work but through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development it is discriminating against part-time workers. The Minister comes from the west and I come from the north west, and we know that many holdings are not viable. There is no way that under the current regime a farmer in these regions can survive in agriculture and they need to supplement their income through part-time work.</P>
    <P>Another sector which has been dealt a major blow in recent times as a result of BSE is the meat industry, including boning halls and burger manufacturers. There must be very flexible rules in the system to ensure the people in this sector are not discriminated against. They have lost full-time or part-time jobs solely because of situations outside their control, and their short-term needs must be facilitated. Many of these people are highly skilled operators. Some have left the country to find jobs elsewhere at a time when we are trying to bring in workers from outside the State. I am not sure if this is addressed in the legislation, but it must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children, despite all the moneys available to it, is closing down a maternity unit in Monaghan General Hospital, and staff there will not necessarily be near a similar unit and may have to be facilitated in terms of flexible hours. Many nurses, particularly in rural communities, have been in part-time work or in temporary employment for between four and six years, and I hope the Bill will give them rights which they have not had previously. It is vital that their commitment to the health services is recognised. In the case of Mon<Col N="809" /> aghan General Hospital it is hard to understand at times why workers getting £8 per hour on a part-time basis are replaced by workers from outside contract bodies who are being paid £12 or £13 per hour, something which is happening under contract structures. This must be examined to ensure that people who are committed to a job receive their just rights.</P>
    <P>It is very important that flexible working be facilitated to ensure we have a family friendly policy, something mentioned by the Minister in his speech. Part-time work is often necessary to allow one parent to be at home when children return from school or a crèche, something which can also be facilitated through work sharing. I want to ensure that this Bill caters for such structures. It is necessary that parents have an opportunity to be with their children as much as possible. Many young people are getting into trouble, and they are not all from the very poor areas. Recently I came across a case where 14 year olds had to be taken in by the Garda as they were involved in breaking windows and all sorts of vandalism. If parents were able to be more available then the long-term upbringing of children would be benefited and the need for security, etc. would be curtailed.</P>
    <P>Another area is care for the elderly and the handicapped. There are many groups involved in looking after the elderly, including home helps, carers and others. I hope the Bill will give some of these workers rights which they have not previously had. Under the minimum pay legislation there have been fairly significant changes. These people provide an extremely positive service for the elderly and the handicapped, and we must encourage them and ensure more people, especially women, are prepared to make themselves available for such work. In this regard not only am I talking about pension and sick leave rights, but also the issue of medical cards. A worry of some women accepting small amounts of money for providing care is the threat of losing the medical card, which is very serious. It is one reason why Fine Gael has put forward proposals to double the means test for medical cards so as to allow people become involved in part-time work.</P>
    <P>Only last year I came across a similar problem in terms of a person who was doing the necessary and important job of a fire fighter in a small rural town and who applied for third level grants for his children. For the sake of a few thousands pounds a year, they lost £1,400 pounds per year over a four year period for the education of their child. We must examine these areas if we are to give proper rights to those who are prepared to do these necessary part-time jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton has already covered the issue of people for whom it is not possible to get back into full-time employment. Until recently people in the 50 to 55 year old age bracket could work for three years on FÁS schemes, get a turn-over and get another run on very necessary work for their <Col N="810" /> local communities. The work done through these schemes has been magnificent. The redevelopment of small villages, rural communities, churchyards and so on would not have happened if those schemes had not been put in place. Many of these people are in receipt of early retirement benefit because they cannot get other jobs. We should reconsider that system which allowed such people to work for approximately 20 hours per week, or a new scheme if necessary, to ensure the developments that have taken place in local communities in the past few years are maintained.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware of the Kavanagh Centre in Enniskeen where EU, cross-Border and locally raised funds have done a magnificent job. However, since Kavanagh's poems were taken off the school curriculum the centre no longer benefits from visits by bus loads of school children. The Border area does not benefit from the same level of tourism activity as Killarney, Donegal or elsewhere. Without people to work in and maintain that centre through community schemes, the good work of the centre will not be able to continue. While Monaghan County Council has provided some assistance for the centre, in the long-term a change in the FÁS rules is necessary if the older people &ndash; from memory I think approximately 18 people from the local parish were involved &ndash; are to benefit. I urge the Minister of State to consider this. These people have pride in their community and want to contribute something to it in their latter days. If these rules, or if necessary the FÁS structure, were changed to facilitate them, we could maintain the community structures that were built up through FÁS in the past few years. Other towns, villages and communities within cities would also benefit if such facilities were maintained and developed.</P>
    <P>Some excellent Bills have been put through the House, for example, the legislation which dealt with the business expansion scheme passed in 1989. However, while excellent laws were put in place under that legislation, it took six years for the personnel to be put in place to operate them. I hope that when this Bill is passed &ndash; I understand all parties support it &ndash; the necessary personnel will be provided to ensure those entitled to benefits receive them and that the entitlements are clearly publicised. Every week in our clinics we meet people who should have been getting assistance for many years from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or elsewhere, but because they do not know to what they are entitled, they are not getting what is rightfully theirs. We have to sell the provisions set out in this Bill and ensure the structures are properly manned and financed. Otherwise, we support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I have had the privilege of welcoming much legislation on conditions of work, particularly equality at work. This legislation is particularly welcome at a time when the economy can, I hope, support it and work positively to even enlarge and develop it. <Col N="811" /> As my colleagues know, from the point of view of European Union legislation, we have been often almost dragged screaming to introduce legislation but work structures and in particular the economy did not allow its positive endorsement or the allocation of resources to enable it to be developed fully. I hope this will not happen in this case and that much of what is contained in this legislation will be market driven. In all legislation, particularly with regard to equality, that is a significant benefit as circumstances and skill shortages will inspire employers and workers' associations to work towards developing a more family-friendly work environment.</P>
      <P>In that context I refer to the 1993 Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in which the section on women and work focused on atypical work. The report defined atypical work as including part-time, temporary, casual, seasonal, agency and home working. At that stage those categories of work probably were atypical, but less than ten years later they have become very typical and will become even more typical. I welcome this humanising of work and family that was not allowed until now. It is astonishing, although welcome, that we have reached a stage where we can label most of these categories &ldquo;typical&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The report also defined those categories of work and welcomed the Worker Protection (Part-Time Employees) Act, 1990. This Bill is a significant improvement and much progress has been made, particularly with regard to the pension rights and the protection and rights of part-time employees, <i>vis-à-vis</i> what we still recognise as full-time employees. The report also highlights &ndash; I know the Minister will note this &ndash; the areas where discrimination still existed and the fact that employers often take for granted the importance of the work being done. While this is not the direct responsibility of the Minister present, I hope this Bill is not introduced in isolation. Some speakers dealt with areas that, while they do not come directly within the Minister's responsibility, would be part and parcel not just of Government but European policy. One area to which they pay particular attention is PRSI for child care and domestic workers in private houses. That area has been exploited for many years. I am old enough to remember the marriage bar which did not permit married women to work outside the home until 1973. That led to great difficulty and discrimination. Such women discovered that they did not have PRSI cover in their own right for the years they spent doing valuable work in the home, child-rearing and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An area that caused most stress to a generation that is passing because of new work practices and the working partnership between men and women and where there was no acknowledgement of the work women did, was in regard to pensions. If the pension paid to the husband exceeded a certain amount the wife and homemaker found she had no pension in her own right. <Col N="812" /> She was included only as part of the husband's pension. The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights made a strong petition that, even if it means adjusting tax or the partner's pension, the value and contribution to the State of work within the home could be rewarded by way of paying direct pension to the partner. We will continue to work on that in the context of the debate on pensions at Irish and European level.</P>
    <P>An area to be encouraged is home working. If we could encourage people to work, even part-time, from their home it would relieve many traffic, child care and other problems. However, such people would need to be protected. There is a focus on that issue at European level. The Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women states that the problem with home working is it is often entirely unregulated as regards health and safety aspects and there is also the likelihood that many forms of it operate in the informal economy. Is the Minister involved at European level with the guidelines being drawn up which will shape policy in this area? While this approach might solve many of our problems, employers are reluctant to trust people to work from home.</P>
    <P>Much part-time work is performed by women and, as a result, has been the subject of discrimination. Women suffered from lack of choice in that it might have been the only work available to them. They would sacrifice full-time jobs and careers because of domestic and parenting responsibilities. I was interested to note in the Minister's speech that each year member states are requested to prepare an employment action plan setting out their respective Government's proposals on how to improve the overall economic environment in terms of people at work. They highlight opportunities for women who have raised their families and are keen to return to the workplace. They formulate family friendly policies which facilitate greater female participation in the workforce. I noted with interest that the Minister mentioned the European Commission guidelines for 2001, which is the fourth year of this process, and said they will help to formulate policies involving more employment friendly approaches and positive measures to maintain the skills and working capacity of older workers in particular. I would welcome any information the Minister may have on that.</P>
    <P>I recognise what has been done in the area of child care but a great deal remains to be done. It is not just a question of how the State will provide and support greater State child care. We must consider how developments in other areas would help to resolve our child care problems. The Minister is probably too young to remember but, as a result of pressure from women, flexi-time was introduced. At the time, most employers looked on it with horror and believed it was a feminist threat to the structured workforce. However, when it was put into practice productivity increased, absenteeism decreased and it <Col N="813" /> led to a much more ordered life for those, including men, who took advantage of it. More can be done now that we have technology. We could have core working times and, at either end of those, people could work from home. There should be greater initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is still great difficulty regarding job-sharing. While there may be the will, there are practical difficulties that do not receive much sympathy. Many women who did not have access to job-sharing were forced out of employment. With greater flexibility and job-sharing we could have retained women in the workforce and allowed them to continue their careers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten paid special attention to section 20 which is central to working in both Ireland and Europe. He said: </P>
    <P>In relation to section 20 of the Bill which protects Irish posted or contract workers in employment outside Ireland and foreign workers posted inside Ireland, will the Minister expand this section to specifically deal with the abuse of foreign workers on work permits in Ireland?</P>
    <P>He then gave examples. We must ensure we do not have a two-tier society and that the standards applied to foreign workers are the same as those which apply to Irish workers. I am sure the Minister will address this issue.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I ask the Minister to advertise the new provisions and to give as much information as possible to employers and employees so that they know the provisions are backed up by the Labour Court, commissioners and necessary legal measures. When introducing new legislation sometimes a few model cases serve notice on all concerned that it will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that contract cleaners are very much exploited due to various circumstances. They work unsocial hours so they can help their families. Some years ago a group of cleaners attempted to strike to secure some protection in terms of their employment and the minimum rate of pay. They were told by their employer in no uncertain terms that if they went on strike they would bring a bus into another housing estate and fill it with other workers. These cleaners were totally unprotected. Despite our booming economy a large number of people still rely on this type of work. This is due to educational and training disadvantage and because many of these workers have to look after their families during the day. Will these disadvantaged categories be covered by the legislation? How much more work must be done to ensure all workers have choices and flexibility and, above all, can enjoy the same standards as the rest of us?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, clearly outlined the Labour Party's position on the Bill. I broadly welcome the Bill, however late <Col N="814" /> it may be. Many years ago when I was a national trade union official for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions I called for legislation to deal with part-time workers. Even though the situation was bad at that stage &ndash; I am going back more than 20 years &ndash; strange as it may seem the situation has got substantially worse in spite of our booming economy and record number of job vacancies.</P>
      <P>I want to follow up on the point made by Deputy Barnes in relation to foreign workers. Two weeks ago a number of foreign workers came into my constituency office. I was horrified by their accounts of how they are exploited. I want to deal with this issue in the context of the agencies which have sprung up all over the place. We imported this concept from the UK. It started in the building industry but it has spread across the board. These unfortunate workers, who are far from home, work 60 hours per week and are not paid overtime for working Saturday and Sunday. They do not receive holiday pay and have no proper meal breaks. In addition, the agency puts 14 or 15 of them in a house and deducts the rent from their wages. The Bill does not specifically cover this problem as these people work 50 and 60 hours per week. However, I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to extending the scope of the legislation to cover this type of exploitation.</P>
      <P>These agencies effectively get more from employers than the people who are working. I am aware of many such cases. For example, in a case involving a member of my family the agency took £15 per hour from the employer but paid only half of this to him. The agency was earning as much per week as this member of my family who worked on a building site. I raised this matter with the CIF and the other agencies which came before the Committee of Public Accounts last year and they undertook to come back to us on it.</P>
      <P>The problem of the exploitation of part-time workers is well known and well established. This is why I welcome the Bill. Deputy Barnes referred to a number of the categories, for example, contract cleaners, domestics, workers in the food industry involved in mushroom picking, etc., and workers in the hotel and catering industries, which are notorious to say the least. There is a JLC in the hotel and catering industry which lays down statutory conditions on pay for part-time and full-time workers. There is no doubt these conditions are repeatedly ignored in every area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of five JLCs when I was in the trade union movement. The Department does not have an adequate inspectorate to cover the wide range of employments where exploitation of part-time workers takes place. I ask the Minister to outline how he proposes to deal with this in the context of the Bill. This area cannot be policed for one specific reason, that is, most of the people in these employments work late at night, long after the Department's inspectorate has gone <Col N="815" /> home. These people work late at night or start work at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. and it is not possible&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has changed in recent times and the inspectorate now works at night. This is an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that and would like to see some evidence. The Minister might give us the facts and figures. It may happen in Dublin but it certainly does not happen in Border areas. I have no reason to doubt the Minister and I hope he is correct.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but there is no point putting legislation on the Statute Book if the Department does not have the manpower to police it. Inspectors need to go into hotels to see the unfortunate women who have to work until 1 a.m., 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. in kitchens, bars etc. These women are not registered for social welfare, PRSI, taxation or pension purposes even though many of them are covered by the conditions of the JLCs. The JLCs do valuable work but I ask the Minister to tell us the number of extra people in the Department who will be employed to police the implementation of the legislation. It is important that we do so, otherwise the legislation is not worth the paper on which it is written.</P>
      <P>The majority of part-time workers who are exploited are women. There are two reasons it is difficult in many cases to establish that employers are breaking the law. First, they employ these workers on a part-time basis, usually at weekends, late at night or early in the morning and, second, they do not register the workers for anything. This is mainly because the employers do not wish to pay what they should be paying on behalf of the employees. However, in many cases the workers are on so social welfare, their husbands are working and they would prefer to receive a few pounds under the counter than have their employment registered.</P>
      <P>It is only when these unfortunate women reach pensionable age that they discover they are not entitled to an old age pension and, at best, they will receive a non-contributory pension if their husbands are on low pay. A woman can work part-time all her life yet find she is not entitled to anything when she reaches pensionable age.</P>
      <P>The Bill should make it compulsory for every employer and agency to supply a register to the Department. In other words, they should have to provide the name, address and PRSI number of each employee and the penalties for non-compliance must be severe. This would mean that departmental inspectors could see whether the law was being applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What effect will this Bill have on joint labour committees? Will the employment regulation orders be revised, deleted or amended to cover the categories of workers to which I referred, most of whom have been covered by JLCs for the past 30 or 40 years? Will the Minister of State outline how the Bill will operate in conjunction <Col N="816" /> with JLCs and employment regulation orders? Employment regulation orders are rarely displayed, as required by law, in hotels, pubs, clubs and other establishments covered by such orders.</P>
    <P>The national minimum wage legislation is on the Statute Book yet many workers are not receiving the national minimum rate. Employers have complained that they cannot get workers. They want to attract workers but at less than the national minimum rate. People come to Members' constituency clinics and complain that their son or daughter is only being paid X amount of money. The obvious advice Members can offer is to ask for the details and report them to the relevant section in the Department. However, people then complain that if this was done their son or daughter would be sacked. The Minister of State will have to strengthen the legislation regarding the register of employees. In 99% of cases it is employers who are breaking the law, yet employees are being penalised and will lose out on a weekly basis and for most of their working lives.</P>
    <P>There are also cases where a couple have a mortgage and a young family, the husband is paying a high rate of tax and the wife receives a few pounds for part-time work. Many such couples are reluctant to declare this income. In such circumstances the onus should not be on the worker but on the employer to declare that income, and the penalty for non-compliance should be very severe. How many employers were taken to court in the past year for exploiting part-time workers or for non-compliance with PRSI, tax, overtime pay and other labour legislation? Most if not all these workers never receive holiday pay.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister of State said that part-time workers will be covered for the purposes of a variety of labour legislation. How does he propose to achieve this? Will his inspectors examine a hotel's records to discover whether, for example, part-time workers are recorded as working in the establishment and, if they are recorded, whether they receive holiday pay, paid leave or other entitlements under labour legislation? Every employer should be obliged by law to register every full-time and part-time worker and the penalty for non-compliance should be severe.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the Revenue Commissioners sent a team of inspectors to a particular town which I will not name. This team discovered that half the employers, including those in the hotel and catering sector, were not paying what they should have been paying in tax. Many pubs were refused licences because they were not paying the correct amount of tax. This is the kind of effort we need from the Department on behalf of workers who are being exploited. The Minister of State should send a team of inspectors to a town to examine every shop, hotel, mushroom plant, domestic cleaning company and employment agency. Such an approach would mean that employers and the public will know we are <Col N="817" /> serious about dealing with the exploitation of workers.</P>
    <P>This legislation was prompted by organisations such as the Council of Europe, the International Labour Organisation and the EU. It is a pity we always have to be directed by Europe to introduce social legislation. However, such legislation is welcome no matter how late it is introduced. The problem is that many EU labour directives have not been enacted. I will pursue this matter as workers' rights could and should be strengthened by the introduction of EU directives which have not been transposed into Irish law.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the issue of agencies. Will the Minister of State take a serious look at this new anti-social evil which has crept into Irish society? This practice is more prevalent in Dublin than in provincial areas. One has only to look at the local and national newspapers to see agencies looking for part-time and full-time workers. Will the Minister of State give serious consideration to enacting a regulation under existing labour law, introducing a Bill or amending this Bill to ensure that these agencies operate under licence? The licence should be issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its operation should be subject to labour law and supervised by the Department.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a major step forward. Will the Minister of State give consideration to some of the points I raised? The Labour Party welcomes the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. Before I deal with the essence of it I will raise the issue of discrimination of part-time employees. Perhaps this issue is more relevant to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, but I ask the Minister of State to convey my points to him and to the Government.</P>
      <P>I refer to a situation which has arisen in the AIBP packing plant in Rathkeale. For many years part-time employees were in receipt of social welfare. However, the Department has now decided to withdraw any entitlements to social welfare from them, although some have been in receipt of social welfare for 12 years. These people have worked for up to 30 years with the company. They were employed on a full-time basis but that was changed to a one, two or three day week. They were able to maintain a certain standard of living because they built up credits for unemployment benefit. However, they have now been informed that after all these years they are not entitled to any further unemployment benefit. This will have a severe effect on their incomes, families and standard of living. Some of these people have for 30 years paid into a pension scheme and other schemes which are service related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is giving them a choice of a low standard of living where they cannot support their families or of finding employment elsewhere and losing the credits they have built up during their years of service. That is mean and wrong. <Col N="818" /> There is a custom where up to 12 or 15 years of short time working is augmented by an entitlement to unemployment benefit. Can someone with a family survive on one or two days' pay without an augmented income? Is the Minister expecting a person who is 50 or 55 years of age, who has worked in a company since he or she was 17 or 20 and who has a skill in the meat industry to walk away from it and to try to find employment elsewhere? That is the stark choice those people must face. It is unfair to expect people to abandon their pension and other rights and to find alternative employment where they do not have any experience and where their skills will be redundant.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that the Minister of State has only some responsibility in this area &ndash; it is an issue for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs &ndash; I ask him to seriously examine this situation. It was examined a few years ago and the Department decided that the right thing to do was to continue the payment. Why, one and a half or two years later, has it changed its mind? What has happened to cause it to change its mind and leave those employees and their families in a serious position?</P>
    <P>If these employees leave the company, they will probably be replaced by workers from eastern Europe who have work permits. Some of those people are already employed there. I am not making judgments about anyone. However, we should question a system which forces Irish workers to leave their employment after 20 years of service and replaces them with people from abroad. I have made representations on behalf of people to get work permits as quickly as possible so they can come to Ireland because we need them in certain employment areas. We need them to respond to the economic boom and to fuel the engine of the Celtic tiger. We must ensure that those employees who come from abroad are not discriminated against. I am extremely concerned that unscrupulous people may use foreign employees for cheap labour. We must not tolerate that.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Bell about the JLCs. While things might have changed, my experience in that area is that few inspections are done. I am only speaking about Limerick and the midwest. We often debated this issue on local radio. People, particularly those in the catering industry who were not in a union, were exploited, while those who were in a union were taken care of. I am talking about smaller fast food outlets. Inspections were not carried out and controls were not enforced. Perhaps the Minister of State, who hinted at changes in this area, could clarify if they have taken place.</P>
    <P>Three quarters of part-time employees are women. We need innovative policies to attract more people into the work force including men and people who have retired. In the past we had a discriminatory approach to tapping the skills of those who were over 65 years of age. We must ensure that we tap the skills of someone who is <Col N="819" /> 66 or 67 years of age and who has great skills, whether professional or technical, such as those involved in the motoring or personnel areas, including bus drivers, nurses or any person in State or private services. If there is a body of people who are retired, we could increase the number of part-time workers who are over 65 years of age. We must ensure that pensions are paid and that incentives are put in place to tap this available resource.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the approach of public bodies, such as the health boards, to part-time employees. They do not give the same <i>pro rata</i> benefits to part-time employees. I know of one case where part-time nurses were not entitled to their increments. This meant they stayed at the bottom of the incremental scale. I am glad that does not happen as frequently now. I come from a rural area, part of which is quite wealthy but much of it is very poor. We have seen a total change in the social fabric of many rural communities which to a large extent were based on small family farms, but people can no longer survive on such farms. They either augment their income by having a spouse working or by working part-time themselves, or both. It is important to have programmes in place to train people who are rural based and come from an agricultural background, to ensure that at any age they will have an opportunity to augment their income because a small family farm can no longer sustain them. If we do not do so, people will leave remote rural parishes. In fact, they are already leaving such areas of which there are many in my constituency. We see schools declining and losing teachers while GAA and soccer teams are unable to field teams as they could ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>In the late 1960s, Carrigkerry in County Limerick had a vibrant community. Young people from the area were working in Rathkeale, Listowel, Newcastle West and Foynes. The village had a large lounge bar which could hold 700 or 800 people at night, but it is no longer there. The people have gone and so have the houses. It is now becoming a forest area. Those are among the stark changes we have witnessed in rural areas and we must do everything possible to reverse them.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is anxious to complete Second Stage this evening. I had planned to speak for 20 minutes but I will facilitate the Minister in allowing the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank the Deputies opposite, first, for their contributions to the debate and, second, for facilitating me in trying to deal with as many of the issues that have been raised as I can. If I do not deal with all of them now, I promise Deputies that I will do so on Committee Stage. If Deputies wish to raise any issues between now and Committee Stage, either with me or with my officials, <Col N="820" /> they should feel free to do so. Deputies will appreciate that, for obvious reasons, there is a sense of urgency about this Bill.</P>
      <P>Interventions and suggestions have been made by various Deputies in a positive manner and I will be as constructive as possible in examining them. The objectives of the directive on which the Bill is based are to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers, to improve the quality of part-time work, to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes account of employers and workers.</P>
      <P>I would like to respond to some of the points that have been raised during the debate. Deputies Rabbitte and Carey referred to the possible adverse impact of this proposal on pensions of groups such as teachers and nurses who, for example, might work for a long period of years on the basis of a seven hour week. Deputies suggested that an exclusion which is based on falling below the threshold measured by a percentage of the normal working week might be a preferable alternative. This suggestion is worthy of examination and I will ask my officials to look at it. We can return to the matter at the Select Committee.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies also criticised what they saw as the convoluted and circular wording of the Bill and questioned whether it could be understood by the average worker or trade union official. That is a legitimate criticism. I am assured that the language used in the Bill is necessary for the precise transposition into Irish law of the provisions of the directive. However, my Department, as is usual in this situation, will be providing an explanatory booklet on the Bill when enacted and this will be couched in every day language.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring pointed out correctly that if one wants people to work they must be treated properly. People are now more aware of their rights and entitlements and because of this my Department has an information unit which last year dealt with over 120,000 inquiries from the public about their employment rights. That proves that important issues have to be addressed. Deputies will appreciate that I am examining many other issues, including bullying in the workplace which is the subject of a task force. I know that both Deputies opposite have an interest in ensuring that we will deal with that issue. There are many workplace issues which we need to advance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell mentioned inspectors and asked whether they can visit workplaces at night. We only recently negotiated that provision with the inspectors. Seven new inspectors have been appointed recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Carey, Callely and Neville raised the issue of people working beyond 65 and I agree that people should be able to do so. This may require amending the relevant pension legislation. I assure Deputies Naughten and Rabbitte on this point as they mentioned the taxation of pensioners. I have been clear about this. In my <Col N="821" /> view, we should be giving older people a chance to go back to work if they wish to do so. The issues raised need to be examined in the context of older people wishing to return to work. I will formally convey those views to the relevant Ministers. Basically, age is an opportunity and not a threat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes referred to teleworking which is an issue for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to whom I will pass on her remarks. She also spoke about the employment action plan and, yes, member states' proposals in that area go to a summit for approval.</P>
    <P>I look forward to dealing with this Bill on Committee Stage. ICTU and IBEC have suggested a number of changes which I will have to examine in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely welcomed the legislation and as Chairman of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business he will obviously be anxious to help us to ensure that the legislation is enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the specifics of the Bill, a number of points mentioned by Deputies raise important issues which we can discuss in greater depth at the Select Committee. Deputy Barnes raised some technical issues which I will be dealing with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to issues which relate to other parts of my Department. Important points were made about community employment, and many of my colleagues on this side of the House have been raising these issues recently. I assure Deputies that I will convey those matters to the relevant sections in my Department and to the Tánaiste. They are issues of which people are very much aware. Deputy Connaughton from Mayo, an area I know well, raised some important issues. My brother, Deputy Michael Kitt, shares that constituency with Deputy Connaughton so I am very much aware of those matters.</P>

      <P>I welcome and support this motion which has been tabled by Fine Gael. The report of the investigation by the Ombudsman into the abuse of elderly people sets out an official and institutional abuse of vulnerable, eld<Col N="823" /> erly people which is truly shocking. These people, many of them sick and all of them elderly, were conned out of money by health boards with the collusion of the Department of Health and Children. The report has forced the Minister for Health and Children to tell the House what he is doing about it. He has provided money and has made some modest proposals but his response last night did not go far enough. What we are dealing with is not just a question about money that is owed, it also concerns a system that was designed to protect the elderly being bent and distorted into a lever to exploit them. When a young man who robs an old aged pensioner to feed a drug habit is caught and put in jail we consider it, rightly, to be a crime deserving punishment. If an old age pensioner is conned out of money by an official in a secure job but who is working under pressure, what should we call it? The Ombudsman described these actions by the health boards and the Department as fundamentally wrong. He also says that they constituted significant maladministration.</P>
      <P>In his summation, the Ombudsman outlined the two functions that need to be met on an issue of such seriousness. First, there is an onus on the Government to provide public services and to meet people's needs. The other requirement is to protect people against the actions of a Government when it fails to fulfil its responsibilities, as happened in this instance. He rightly set the context within the ambit of a human rights framework, which is being generally constructed internationally to protect the rights of many different groups in society. Yet that overarching concern has not been addressed by this Government. We heard the Minister say that he is coughing up the money but he is silent when it comes to addressing the safeguards needed to protect elderly people from abuse, whether from official quarters or not. A charter of rights for older people underpinned by legislation is what is needed now and is what this Government should be undertaking publicly to deliver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that public welfare homes will now come under the independent inspectorate being set up along with the other duties of the health board inspectorate, and that is welcome. For too long these public facilities were outside the loop when it came to any inspection system and there was clearly a conflict of interest when it came to a health board inspecting private facilities that provided health board contract beds. He did not, however, deal with the issue of making secondary legislation properly accountable to the Oireachtas. The report states that the Dáil and Seanad appear to have no effective mechanisms for vetting regulations which flow from primary legislation. We know that is the case and every time I have raised this issue when legislation is being processed through Committee Stage, this Minister and his <Col N="824" /> predecessor have blocked any such proposal of mine to make regulations accountable.</P>
    <P>It is always uncomfortable for a Government to give up any power that it has but it is unconscionable not to do so after such an expose by the Ombudsman of the deficiencies of our democracy. Yet the Minister is silent on this issue, as is his Government. This is simply not good enough. If the lessons are to be learned, then the necessity for checks and balances must also be acknowledged. Shifting this report off to the Committee on Health and Children is all very well, but I do not believe the Minister can get off the hook that easily. His bland disposal of the Ombudsman's central criticism of the way the Oireachtas operates and its failure to protect the rights of our citizens is simply unacceptable. It is insulting to talk about performance management indicators for health boards as if somehow they will ensure equality and the safeguarding of people's entitlements and rights.</P>
    <P>The Government should also be making a clear commitment to creating a much more flexible system of care supports for older people. Care requirements should determine funding and not, as currently pertains, the other way around. There is at present an over-reliance on private nursing home care to meet the long-term needs of older people. The subvention arrangements ensure that over-dependence. Financial and other supports should enable older people to stay at home as well as access nursing home care when they need it. Indeed, there should be a built-in bias towards home care solutions and home care supports.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to inequity of treatment, yet he must be aware of the gross inequity that occurs in different parts of the country, between people on different incomes and, indeed, the differences in accessing services provided by physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and the like by elderly people. These are among the many issues that need to be addressed if we are to provide for those of us who are elderly now and for the ever increasing number of elderly people into the future.</P>
    <P>Government policy is to accord independence and dignity to older people but the record shows that in relation to an important part of care for the elderly, health boards and the Department of Health and Children were culpable when they failed to protect the dignity, independence and rights of people who, in many cases, were suffering ill-health and who, in all cases, were elderly and vulnerable. I remember families coming to me during those years who were driven to distraction from worry because of the strictures laid down by health boards before their elderly relative could access the care he or she needed. These people were forced to undergo very stressful and unfair pressures by health boards even though the Department of Health and Children and the Attorney General at the time had received expert advice that such practices would be found to be <Col N="825" /> illegal if challenged in the courts. This is a disgracefully shabby saga.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has done us and the public a great service in the preparation of this report but the Minister for Health and Children cannot expect us to believe that his response, as articulated yesterday, is an adequate one nor is it the case that this Government, as a whole, is responding authoritatively to the requirements set out in this report. The Committee on Health and Children will consider this report, and I welcome that. However, I do not wish to go along with what is clearly an attempt by the Minister for Health and Children to try to simply off-load this report with its many awkward questions and serious challenges without comment.</P>
    <P>Just spending money is too easy an option, particularly for a Minister for Health and Children who has so much money he does not know what to do with it and spends it on sponsoring snooker competitions. Throwing money at a problem is the hallmark of this Government and this Minister. We have a health system in crisis and have almost 30,000 on hospital waiting lists, most of whom are experiencing longer waiting times than they might have done a year ago. There is clearly no fewer a number on these waiting lists than when this Government took office. There is very little difference in the numbers even though this Government was elected on the promise that it would tackle waiting lists. The Government is spending a lot more money on health about which there is no doubt, although in terms of percentage of GDP, we are still below the EU average. Despite the funding, sadly there is no evidence that this Government has a clue about how it should deal with the serious deficiencies and the gross inequities which characterise the health care service. In this regard, last night the Minister confirmed the suspicion that he has also failed to meet the challenge set out in the report of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to another report of relevance to this issue on the care for the elderly scheme operated by the health boards. It is again a very startling report in terms of outlining the experiences people have. While we, as a society, rightly say that elderly people should not be forced into institutional care, that, of necessity, places an onus on us to ensure that home is a safe, good and healthy place for an older person. Some of the key findings in the report are that fuel poverty in Ireland is among the highest in Europe for elderly people, housing standards are among the lowest and morbidity and mortality figures are among the most serious in Europe as a result of poor housing conditions. These issues need to be addressed and are part and parcel of the issues examined indirectly by the Ombudsman. The issues directly examined by the Ombudsman are, in a sense, symptomatic of larger questions relating to the care of the elderly.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Ombudsman for highlighting these very important facts regarding nursing home subventions. For the past year and a half, since joining the Southern Health Board I have been beating this drum on the shameful practice of deducting entire pensions from people and not providing enough subvention. Older people did not have money to get their hair done or to have essential work done. The practice engaged in by the health boards in the past was shameful.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have failed to act on this breach of the regulations but at least this Government is rectifying the matter. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for having the decency, last night, to apologise to those who were affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision he has made in relation to the Ombudsman's report and that he has allocated £4 million to different health boards in the past year to pay off arrears. All the arrears in the Southern Health Board have been paid except in eight cases where there are legal implications. We are proactive in advising family members that there is no legal obligation to contribute to the nursing home care of a relative who qualifies for subvention. Since July 2000 I brought this matter to the attention of our health board where we produced a leaflet setting out the guidelines for nursing home subvention. The Southern Health Board spent £5.5 million last year in nursing home care and subvention. That is not enough. I hope more moneys can be made available to health boards for nursing home care. Deputy Dennehy and I have been active in the Southern Health Board on community care matters and on the nursing home subvention. I welcome the extra £20 million provided for in the budget. We had long discussions at our parliamentary party meeting where we managed to convince the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to make extra money available for care of the elderly.</P>
      <P>We must support nursing home subvention increases, provide more hospital beds and ensure more community supports are put in place. At all times we must treat people with dignity and respect. I commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, on taking so many initiatives since taking office, and ensuring a doubling of health allocation since 1997. Much has been done but much more needs to be done. Irrespective of what party is in Government there will always be a need for increased funding for health services. I hope much more will be achieved in the next couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have asked the Minister to look at the question of people who own their own properties and the assessments being carried out. It is unfair that under the regulations health boards can <Col N="827" /> assess a person's principal residence if they are in nursing home care and deduct so much money by way of rental. Most of those houses are not let and are vacant until the person returns from the nursing home, if they ever return.</P>
    <P>I had some appalling cases last year where people entitled to subvention were not told they did not have to contribute. I have had cases where money put away for a burial had to be used to top up the subvention. In another case a lady had to live on £29 per week. That had to be rectified by an enhanced subvention. I have no doubt every Member can speak of different situations in respect of nursing home subvention. My message, even as a Government backbencher, is simple. We must do more for the elderly and ensure money is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman's lengthy and well-researched and detailed report on this matter must be welcomed despite the many questions it raises. I have received representations from my constituents in Dublin North East, one of which was from Liam Clines who was confronted by the health board. When this happened I contacted Deputy O'Flynn in Cork. The person involved was asked how many children he had and was told their earnings would have to be assessed. That is wrong. It was incorrect of the health boards to accept this money whether it was given voluntarily or involuntarily in the knowledge that the request was invalid. The Health Act, 1990, did not specify that that should happen. I cannot understand why a person who has paid taxes and worked all his life and goes into a nursing home must be subject to a decision by a health board executive that his adult children should pay for his keep. That is wrong and has to be rectified. Will those who have paid up be reimbursed? They should be. That is a question for the Minister and the Department.</P>
      <P>The questions raised about the ability of the executive branch and the public administrators of this country to carry out the distinct stated wishes and intentions of the Oireachtas are serious. The Oireachtas has not ever discussed this matter. A clear indication was not given by the Oireachtas at any time that this should happen.</P>
      <P>I welcome the wide ranging assurances given by the Minister for Health and Children that the issues raised in the Ombudsman's report will be remedied as quickly as possible. It is not an exaggeration to state that what was done to many citizens, some of whom are dead, and to their families amounted to a serious wrong which arose from abuse of office by many public servants. There are many tribunals investigating various matters but the exploitation of the elderly is a most serious matter. It must be investigated and we must get answers from the Minister. The resolution is simple. We must acknowledge the wrongs done and rectify them. Those who paid money to the health boards must be reimbursed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two people to whom the Oireachtas owes a debt of gratitude, the Ombudsman for producing his report and the Minister for Health and Children. As soon as the report was presented to him the Minister took immediate steps to rectify the situation. He can do no more than to immediately repay all outstanding arrears to those who were adversely affected. Even though the system inflicted wrong by taking money from families when it should not have done so, the Ombudsman legislation is working well in that he is able to identify these problems. The job of the Ombdusman is to protect citizens, to provide redress where there have been inadequacies and to promote high standards in public administration. We are not concerned with low standards in this House or in the actions of the Minister or the Ombudsman, but in public administration. Thank God for the Ombudsman and that he was able to make this report following a series of complaints.</P>
      <P>Following my experience with the Ombudsman's office I make a plea for a major increase in the funding allocated to him. Shortly after I became a Member of the House I saw his first annual report and was shocked to see the number of complaints from County Laois. It was out of all proportion to those received from most neighbouring counties. On investigation I discovered that Portlaoise is the only provincial town outside the major cities where he holds a monthly clinic. It illustrates the latent need in every county for the Ombudsman's office to investigate and follow up on complaints.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from various constituents since this issue was highlighted asking what can be done in terms of getting the matter redressed. As a Government backbencher I am pleased to advise them of the good news &ndash; it does not often happen &ndash; that the Government is to ensure that all outstanding arrears are paid in full. When reports like this are presented the official advice is to contest them in the courts, including the European Court, and to then harass those involved for years with a view to wearing them down. That is how the State operated in similar cases. The Minister has done an outstanding service to the Oireachtas in showing that we are responding to the needs of the people when a report is presented to us. I hope the Government will adopt a similar attitude in future cases where the institutions of the State inflict wrongs on citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people attending my clinics are the surviving family members of people who have unfortunately passed away. They had to contribute excessively towards the subvention costs of their parents. While they were happy to do so, it was wrong that they were penalised financially and made to do it. The health boards played on the goodwill of sons and daughters and other family members. I hope a mechanism will be put in place to repay moneys to those in nursing homes and to the surviving family members of the deceased. <Col N="829" /> Specific provision should be made to ensure that repayments are made to the next of kin.</P>
    <P>There are over 6,000 people in nursing homes throughout the country. The cost of this scheme has increased almost tenfold, from £4 million to almost £40 million, in the seven or eight years since it was introduced. I am pleased to note that from 1 April the subvention will be increased by 25%, from £70 to £90, from £95 to £120 and from £120 to £150. Unfortunately, it is not enough. While I am happy with the increase, a further 25% increase would be very welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this timely and important report from the Ombudsman. Private nursing homes are mushrooming around the country because of the failure by the State to provide anything like the number of welfare beds for the elderly. This failure has resulted in much hardship for the elderly and their relatives. The Government is now addressing their needs and providing for them. For example, in my area the Southern Health Board has launched a major action plan, Ageing with Confidence, and money is being provided to fund it. It is badly needed. The elderly and carers made a critical input to the plan. It will provide for extra badly needed beds and will allow for greater support for community care. Those in the health business involved in local care argue that if there was a sufficient number of welfare beds there would be no need for so many nursing homes. The Southern Health Board plan must be funded independently of the nursing home activities.</P>
      <P>In addition to the dependence on private nursing homes, a large proportion of acute or semi-acute beds have been tied up in what the medical profession calls inappropriate uses. Public representatives must defend the rights of the elderly and the use of these beds by them is caused by the non-availability of alternative facilities. If officialdom had its way in the early 1980s all of the district hospitals, which now provide the mainstay care for the elderly, would have been closed at that time. In view of the unsatisfactory bed situation I suspect that many elderly people have been prematurely discharged from hospital.</P>
      <P>Private nursing homes have filled a need and they provide an excellent service. The difficulties identified by the Ombudsman are not their fault. When enacted in 1991, the nursing homes legislation was a major breakthrough in terms of ensuring that a new element of service would be provided to the elderly. Until then no subsidy was available to people and some faced massive hardship in trying to cope with the care of their elderly parents or other relatives. Unfortunately, people have almost slipped back into the same position because of rising costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 legislation was well drafted but implementing the large number of regulations it contains is causing problems. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, introduced an amendment removing the need for <Col N="830" /> health boards to assess the means of family members. That was the greatest stumbling block to addressing the difficulties in this area. However, successive Ministers have refused to amend the regulations, especially the regulation covering the three rates of subvention available. That is critical to the great majority of applicants.</P>
    <P>Ministers for Health from the three major parties have been lobbied to make changes by public interests, including the groups of health board chairpersons, but they refused to do so. I was a member of a delegation that met the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, but we got no response to a request for an increased subvention. I am proud that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is dealing with this grossly unfair situation in an even handed manner. He is increasing the subvention but is also examining the other regulations. I discussed the situation with the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, but it has fallen to my colleague to anticipate and address a number of issues raised by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the principal residence of an applicant for assessment purposes is unfair and offensive. It represents a gross intrusion into family privacy. The logic applied is based on dealing with those who were ignored in institutions but cared for by the State and who, on death, left cash to their families. The scheme must become demand led. The Southern Health Board has adopted my proposal on that. If we do not take this approach the problems identified by the Ombudsman will recur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Ombudsman on nursing home subventions and share the concerns of my colleagues at its findings. I commend the Government for the decision to pay all outstanding arrears due to those affected. The Government has taken a number of initiatives in relation to services for older people. Funding for the development of services for older people has increased from £10 million in 1997 to an additional £36 million in 2000. In 2001, an additional £57 million will be provided. I commend the Minister on the fact that subvention rates will be increased from next April. The maximum of £120 will be increased to £150. One of the difficulties is that whether the payment is £120 or £150, plus a non-contributory old age pension, there is still a shortfall in some nursing homes. There is an inconsistency whereby there is an enhanced subvention of up to £200, or more than £200 in some health boards, which does not apply in the Western Health Board region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to article 8.2 and the pocket money provision. Six of the eight health boards apply the regulations incorrectly. The Western Health Board received £750,000 as part of a £4 million allocation to meet the arrears payments. The Minister was wise to do this. There is also the bigger issue of the assessment of sons' and daughters' ability to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. I was pleased <Col N="831" /> when the previous Minister discontinued that requirement on 1 January 1999. In assessing the elderly for medical cards or other social welfare benefits, there is no consideration of the financial circumstances of adult sons or daughters of the applicants.</P>
    <P>In the interest of fairness and natural justice, the Minister has stated that money should be paid to those adversely affected by this provision. I understand £6 million is the estimated cost of these payments and I commend the Minister for the decision in this regard. It certainly should be Government policy to maintain older people at home with dignity and independence and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government is doing so. We have already improved the free schemes for the elderly. We have introduced schemes for alarms and security devices. We have increased the carer's allowance and introduced a new carer's benefit and a new carer's leave Bill, which are important issues. Another important issue is the number of elderly people living in poor housing conditions.</P>
    <P>The health boards and local authorities throughout the country have a responsibility to improve the schemes for the elderly. In his November 2000 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General spoke specifically about the special housing aid for the elderly. He stressed strongly that we should review and strengthen that particular scheme. The last paragraph on the evaluation of the scheme reads:</P>
    <P>A significant proportion of elderly people are thought to require residential care due to poor housing conditions. In the light of the cost of hospital beds and long stay residential places, the scheme would appear to represent good value for money if it succeeds in creating conditions which facilitate elderly persons living in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>That is a significant statement by the Comptroller and Auditor General where he states that there must be residential care and residential places for elderly people. Proper housing conditions are one means of resolving this problem and I hope the local authorities and health boards will take on board his views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This report makes extraordinarily disturbing reading because it illustrates an attitude of mind, a mentality which is very difficult to get around within parts of our public administration. In my view two issues illustrate the worst kind of maladministration which are highlighted in this excellent report by the Ombudsman. The first issue relates to the mean spirited manner in which the pocket money provisions were dealt with. It is worth reminding ourselves that article 8.2 of the regulation is not complex to read, it is very clearcut. On reading the report, it is clear that an institutional interpretation of the most negative sort was put on this straightforward provision. The interpretation by six health boards <Col N="832" /> is mean spirited and dishonest in equal measure. It is, frankly, a disgrace.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman has done us all a considerable service by bringing into public focus the manner in which simple regulations and laws, which are passed with the permission of this House, are being interpreted in the darkest recesses of some parts of our public administration system. What is even more frightening about the Ombudsman's findings in relation to the pocket money provisions is that when the manner in which these provisions were being interpreted was discovered, £4 million was made available as a once-off payment in order to provide compensation to people. A portion of that compensation was, in fact, pocketed or used elsewhere by the health boards. They have sought to cover their dishonour by saying they spent the portion on other services for the elderly, but that is not the point. The point is that the Minister of the day made funding available to public servants and those public servants took it upon themselves to abuse that particular payment and to use it in a way which was improper, inappropriate and which represented the grossest form of maladministration. We should go beyond simply recording the fact that that happened. It is time to name and shame people.</P>
      <P>The second issue with which the Ombudsman deals is that of family assessment. Members on all sides of the House will have, from time to time, dealt with correspondence on this issue. The time available to me on this matter is very short but I believe the Ombudsman very eloquently represents in his report the plight of families faced with this issue. If one reads the correspondence which was reproduced, it is extraordinary that public servants in caring institutions should have acted in this manner. On page 23, there is a letter from a complainant regarding the North Eastern Health Board. Shame on the officials involved in that case. There was no excuse for their deliberate and perverse misinterpretation. There is a letter dated 24 October 1999 from the Southern Health Board to the Department of Health and Children. Again shame on the officials involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When public administrators receive regulations or instructions from this House, or through the Ministers appointed by this House, they have not just a moral responsibility but a civic responsibility to deliver on those regulations in a way which is client friendly and which recognises the true intentions of Dáil Éireann and of the administration at central Government level. What has happened in a number of these cases is that the regulations have been deliberately, wantonly and in a mean spirited way misrepresented and misapplied. I believe we should go further. One of my difficulties with the Ombudsman legislation, good as it is &ndash; I have the honour of being the first Irish citizen to be a member of the International Ombudsman Institute &ndash; is that it does not actually lay blame. There is an institutional tradition in this House, when faced with maladministration such as this, to do the obvious thing and go for <Col N="833" /> the Minister's throat. It is time to stop that tradition. It is time to introduce a tradition which recognises that, within the administration, there is personal responsibility for the manner in which each and every public servant applies the law of the land and the regulations.</P>
    <P>What we see in this report is an absolutely dramatic example of Sir Humphreyism at its very worst. When mandarins get a bee in their bonnet, they decide they know better. They decide they are superior to this House and that they are the State. A clear message should go out from this House that they are not the State. They are the servants of the people. The people are their clients, the people are their employers and the people through their taxes employ them. They have a moral and civic responsibility to serve the people.</P>

      <P>This is probably the greatest scandal ever caused by the State. People talk about the abuse of the elderly. If thugs in the street robbed old people in their homes, newspapers would call for them to be put in jail. Now the offender is not a thug but the State. The State hurt these old people and their families.</P>
      <P>I am aware of one such case. The person applied for subvention but, because of the harassment of the health board in seeking family members' P60s, tax assessments and what the person's sons and daughters were earning abroad, the man did not go into the State home. He died a lonely old man, alone in his house. He was found dead. That is an outrage and somebody should pay for what happened.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Ombudsman and his office. I listened to the Fianna Fáil Members complimenting the Minister. I say &ldquo;shame on this Minister and on all previous Ministers who allowed this to happen&rdquo;. I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the Ombudsman. I urge the Taoiseach, the Government, the new leader of Fine Gael and the new Front Bench after its appointment tomorrow to give a commitment that the Ombudsman and his office will be given the proper powers, money and staff to deal with further cases of abuse in the State.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children that the Civil Service is out of control. The Civil Service dictates policy, rather than the politicians and Ministers. The reason is that when Fine Gael is in Opposition it says one thing and when it is in Government it says something else; Fianna Fáil does the same. We have taken too many powers from this House and handed them to the National Roads Authority and other State agencies. That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> It is wrong that the day I arrived to this House, having been elected by the people of County Mayo, the Minister's reply to my parliamentary question was that the chief executive of the Western Health Board would respond to me. She would respond, about six months later. That is not good enough. These people are not answerable to anybody and we have allowed that to happen. When I put down a parliamentary question, regardless of whether it relates to the chief executive of the health board or of the county council, I should get a reply and the Ceann Comhairle should protect me, as a Member of the House, and ensure I get that reply.</P>
    <P>We are discussing the abuse of the elderly. We should be ashamed as public representatives and as a nation that we let old people die in their homes because their family members did not have money, did not want to be assessed or because the old person did not want that family member to be assessed. They felt it was not their place to ask it. They preferred to die lonely and at home rather than have a son in England or a daughter in Cork, who had their own problems and mortgages to pay, asked by a chief executive or an official from the health board for their P60 and other private information. It is outrageous and wrong and the people responsible should be dealt with. I agree with a previous speaker that if this had been done by a senior or junior Minister, there would have been calls for tribunals and for the Minister's resignation. However, this involves the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Recently there was controversy about officials double jobbing. It died very quickly. There were tribunals when politicians received payments but when allegations were made about officials, they were kept under wraps. Sometimes the media focus their attention on the wrong people and sometimes they focus on the right people. On this occasion, the Ombudsman did well and he should be complimented. He should also be assisted and given whatever powers he needs because the public has lost faith in me, in other public representatives and in the system.</P>
    <P>The public is right. I was elected to a county council. It has 31 members but only six really count because the rest are spokesmen for the officials. It is time the councillors realised they were elected by the people and not by the officials. I am not against officials. There are some good officials who do a good job and are compassionate, kind and decent. However, other officials think they are gods and that they are above me, the Minister and the law. That is because they are protected by the State, the unions and when they go to court. Last year I was threatened by my county council. I told the council to bring me to the High Court. The difference between the council and me is that if I go to court, I must pay for it. There is nobody to protect me whereas officials are protected by the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>A recent report by the national council on ageing and older people stated that 12,000 elderly <Col N="835" /> people in this State suffer abuse. That is shameful. There was nothing in the report, however, about the abuse that happened to older people and their families with regard to the nursing home subventions. Money was taken from people who could not afford it. The health boards insisted on the money and threatened that if the information they required was not forthcoming, there would be no subvention. What kind of State is this? Has anything been done about it?</P>
    <P>The Minister says the money will be repaid. What about the old man who died in his home? What about the family members who are now dead and will not gain from it? It is shameful and wrong. Last week the Minister of State had a go at me in the local newspaper about the special housing aid for the elderly. There is nothing wrong with that. The special housing aid for the elderly scheme is administered by the health boards. The health board in my constituency is demanding large subscriptions from old people under the scheme. Down the road there will be a further investigation into the collection of money from old people under this scheme. It should not be collected from them. The Minister should abolish the scheme where health boards are seeking contributions. They are threatening these people and that is wrong. The problem was identified in a report published today and the Minister must deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and congratulate our spokesperson, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for putting it before the House. The Department and the health boards systematically and improperly extracted moneys from elderly people who had spent their lives contributing to the State. It happened at the most vulnerable time in their lives, when they were in nursing homes. That was illegal. It caused extreme stress to the elderly and their families and was an affront to the dignity of the people involved.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Ombudsman on identifying this issue in his report. The Minister for Health and Children has a duty and responsibility to immediately set up systems to ensure that full compensation is paid in all cases where people or their families were unlawfully treated. It was unfair that the elderly, at the end of their days, saw their life savings taken illegally. There is no doubt that this ranks with any of the scandals which have been exposed in recent times.</P>
      <P>The approach to administering the nursing home subvention scheme must cause concern to all right thinking people. The report refers to the unacceptable practices of making regulations containing provisions which were likely to be invalid. In at least one instance the likely invalidity had probably been known in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Nursing Homes Act, elderly people are entitled to nursing home care. The public system does not cater for this. In fact, there appears to be a policy of withdrawal from the public sys<Col N="836" /> tem of supporting the elderly in community care. I found it extremely frustrating to see families who had little means being pressurised into paying for nursing home care for their loved ones when they were no longer able to survive in their home environment.</P>
    <P>The Government failed to fund adequately the nursing home subvention service. In the Mid-Western Health Board the ceiling for nursing home subvention is £120. In other health boards there is flexibility at this level. On several occasions I have raised with health board officials the failure of the Mid-Western Health Board to recognise special situations where there is hardship. I am familiar with a case in which a pensioner in receipt of £80 per week whose husband is in a nursing home is obliged to pay £40 per week, in addition to the man's pension, to top up the subvention. The woman is, therefore, forced to live on £40 per week and the health board was unable to assist her, in spite of representations made on her behalf. The community care section was of the view that the matter should be dealt with by the nursing home subvention section but the nursing home subvention section stated that the maximum pension was being received. The woman falls between two stools as a result of which she has a disgraceful standard of living.</P>
    <P>The nursing home regulations facilitated nursing home residents by disregarding one-fifth of their old age pensions. This sum was not to be treated as means but was to be provided as pocket money to the applicants. The Department of Health and Children and the health boards ignored this legal device which was intended to give some semblance of dignity to elderly people.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman clearly states that the 1990 Act does not put the onus on adult children to pay for their parents' nursing home care. The practice of taking into account the income of adult children created deep divisions in some families and great distress for elderly people. I am aware of situations in which nursing home subventions were denied because one member of a family refused to co-operate with other members in the disclosure of income. The system operated by the health boards and the Department has divided families and illegally placed children in the embarrassing position of having to reveal their circumstances to their siblings. In many cases, it has deprived elderly people of adequate care and has forced them to witness disagreement arising among their children.</P>
    <P>The issue of family obligations and children's duties towards their parents was raised by Ann O'Loughlin of the Irish Association of Social Workers on RTE radio in September 1993. She stated that there was a great difference between families coming to terms with their own beliefs about family responsibility and their obligations towards parents and being forced in a quasi-legal manner by the regulations to contribute to their parents' nursing home care. She and her colleagues witnessed the outcome of this type of means testing which resulted in unholy rows and <Col N="837" /> intensified conflict among family members who had different ideas about duties and responsibilities. Ms O'Loughlin also pointed out that many elderly people did not wish to be forced into any level of dependency on their adult children. John Boland, in an article in <i>The Sunday Press</i> in the same year, stated that not only could parents be refused a grant if it was decided that their children's means were too high but that any son or daughter could be informed of the weekly amount the State believed he or she should contribute to the upkeep of a parent. This, Mr. Boland observed, smacked of big brother tactics.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the Western Health Board and the Southern Health Board separately obtained legal advice to the effect that the approach to the pocket money issue proposed by the Department of Health and Children was incorrect. In November 1997, the Office of the Attorney General, in response to queries from the Department, commissioned legal advice from an independent senior counsel on the operation of the pocket money provision. The Department had already conceded that its original advice to the boards was incorrect and the senior counsel felt that there was a question of liability for the payment of arrears. He advised that any person who, as a result of misrepresentation of the regulations, had received a lower level of subvention than would otherwise have been the case, would be entitled to be compensated accordingly.</P>
    <P>Society is judged on how it cares for its old and vulnerable citizens. Ireland's track record in regard to the elderly and people with disabilities is disgraceful. ALONE estimates that 88,000 Irish people over 65 years of age spent Christmas Day on their own. That is a scandalous indictment of our society. Government services must lead the way in showing respect and support for older people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Ombudsman's report although I regret our time is limited. Perhaps the Minister would investigate the possibility of providing Government time to discuss the report at greater length at a future stage. It is important that its content is teased out in detail in order that a similar situation will not arise again.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Ombudsman on his report and I compliment Jody Corcoran of the <i>Sunday Independent </i>who highlighted the terrible injustices which occurred in the past and brought them to public attention. The report outlines three major problems in regard to subventions, pocket money paid to patients and the question of whether elderly people who require hospital services should be in a position to avail of those services free of charge.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman, in his report, draws some conclusions about the provisions which were put into practice following the introduction of legislation in 1990. His conclusions are outlined on page 23 of his report. He states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 Act does not make adult children legally liable for parents' hospital and nursing <Col N="838" /> home costs; there is nothing in the 1990 Act to suggest that any such liability was contemplated by the Oireachtas; the regulations cannot impose a liability on adult children which is not explicitly provided by the 1990 Act; and the entire approach of the regulations in relation to family assessments was fundamentally misconceived.</P>
    <P>Arising from the 1990 legislation, the Department drew up regulations which were presented to the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, and subsequently implemented. The most fundamental flaw in the regulations was the introduction of a new definition in regard to circumstances. The person who brought those regulations to the Minister without explaining their consequences should be called to account. The health boards implemented the regulations in different ways. For example, the Midland Health Board refused subventions when any one of a claimant's children refused to reveal income or personal details. A letter issued by the Midland Health Board at that time states:</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board are, therefore, now requesting you to submit details of income by way of P60, tax assessment form, farm accounts, income from investments etc. The health board must be furnished with these details to enable us to determine your liability, if any. Failure to furnish this information will mean the application for the subvention cannot be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>In other words, the person in need of the subvention would not receive it if the information sought was not produced. It is outrageous that people would be deprived of necessary hospitalisation because of a flawed assessment procedure.</P>
    <P>The Department also issued guidelines on the pocket money payable to adults in medical institutions <i>via</i> a very complicated letter to the health boards. The Ombudsman concludes on page 37 of his report that the essence of the Department's advice was that an amount equivalent to one fifth of the old age pension rate could be disregarded for the purposes of qualifying for the subvention. However, when it came to calculating the amount of subvention to be paid by the qualified person, the disregarded amount was to be taken back into the equation, with the effect, generally, of reducing the level of subvention to be paid. In other words, the pocket money allocation was calculated for the purposes of the subvention and effectively taken back from the applicant. That is unacceptable and I hope a complete reconsideration will be undertaken in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report states that the Midland Health Board received an additional allocation of £300,000 in January 1998, of which £150,000 was intended to cover the payment of arrears to people who had not been given the benefit of the pocket money provisions in the subvention means test. The Midland Health Board originally stated that it had applied article 8.2 correctly but when its attention was drawn to particular cases, it accepted that it had not done <Col N="839" /> so. As of 30 September 2000, the Midland Health Board had paid a total of £86,256 arrears, including arrears in respect of people who had died in the interim. The Midland Health Board did not begin to pay arrears until 26 May 2000, in spite of the fact that it received an allocation for that purpose in January 1998. The board believes it now discharges full liability in respect of such arrears. Does the Minister agree it is outrageous that the health board received money for a specific purpose but failed to spend it on that purpose?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with my colleagues in welcoming the report and complimenting the Ombudsman and his staff on its production. When I was a young fellow, if a child stole money he or she would be brought to answer for that deed. If someone was brought before the court, they could end up in jail even if only a small amount of money was stolen. The way the elderly were dealt with in the homes run by the State throughout the country was accepted by the Department of Health and Children. That is a reality.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State refer this report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>So we will get a copy of the result of that particular investigation.</P>
      <P>On the issue of subvention, we have a subvention package in place that is monitored by the different health boards. The levels are £75, £95 and £120, depending on the number of dependants. These levels have been in place since 1993 but they are not acceptable in 2001. In addition, the Government of the day made a decision that tax incentives would be given to individuals to produce beds for the elderly. That has been done and it is growing apace and, as as result of that decision, I will have the opportunity to be at the opening of a home in my own village in Kilmainham Wood on Friday next.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that when that decision was made, the State did not increase the subvention and the pressure was put on the families, many of whom were under pressure already trying to rear their families and pay mortgages, etc. The rules and regulations, and I spoke on many occasions at health board level, were unfair and the health board officials carried them out to the letter of the law on the basis of what the Department of Health said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for the Minister of State and the senior Minister, Deputy Martin, to immediately increase the level of subvention on the basis of today's prices. We have a duty to the elderly <Col N="840" /> people in society because this Government, or indeed any other Government, treated them shabbily by taking the few pounds pocket money they had and holding on to it. The Minister is now claiming a major victory by saying they will now give them back that money but it should never have been taken in the first place.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions and in different scenarios over the years &ndash; the hepatitis C issue is another example &ndash; officials in the Department of Health and Children defended the State at all times but put down the ordinary individual. They have done it again on this occasion. That particular view did not arise in the health boards throughout the country. It arose in the Department of Health and Children in Hawkins House because they always treated the ordinary citizen differently to themselves. I put it to the Minister that there is need for rapid change in the level of subvention and there is also need to ensure that what happened in this scenario, on the basis of what the Ombudsman has produced in this report, will never happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate tonight and I congratulate Deputy Gay Mitchell in bringing it before the House. It is a damning report by the Ombudsman on the health boards and the Department of Health and Children on their activities and their malpractices over a number of years. One of the most damning features of this report is the fact that long after their malpractice was brought to their notice, the health boards continued in their flouting of the law. Several Bills were passed by this House yet the Department officials defiantly resisted the implementation of the features of these Acts and continued to extract these moneys illegally from vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>Why has this happened? On many occasions in the past I said that officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development are empire building within their own Department. Surely this is another example of that, although perhaps to a lesser extent, because it is individuals within the Department who are doing this.</P>
      <P>It is usual that complaints to the Ombudsman are made about individuals within Departments but this complaint must be seen in the wider corporate area of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards throughout the country. As a member of a health board I must say there is still a resistance within the health boards to acknowledge that they made a mistake. They cast aside the criticisms of what has happened and justify their deeds by saying there were difficult times in the past, that money was not available to the health boards from the Department, that they had to do something and that this was the only way they could provide beds for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a duty on the Department, under the Acts, to provide beds for the elderly in need of care and they failed to deliver that. The only <Col N="841" /> excuse they can give for the extraction of these moneys illegally is to say that they had to provide beds because nobody else would do it. They will say there were insufficient beds in local health board areas, hospitals or institutions to provide care for those people so they had to get some contribution. It is not good enough to put that forward as a reason for engaging in this practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that there are demands from health boards to provide additional funding to return these moneys to the people from whom they were extracted illegally but those health boards got finance within the past 12 months to enable them return some of those moneys but they have failed to do so. If that is not consolidating their arrogance, I do not know what it is. There must be an investigation and I welcome the Minister's statement that he has referred this report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for further examination and action that might be deemed necessary at a later stage. It is important, however, that the Minister takes action now. People on the other side of the House tonight said the Minister took action immediately but it was too late because this practice has gone on for years without any action being taken. How many people have suffered? How many people who are now dead were denied their entitlements because provisions and beds were not available? That is the sad part about this.</P>
    <P>Many families have been hurt. Many elderly people have been hurt. Perhaps an elderly spouse now living realises what was done to them and they have to live with the fact that they were denied this money. How can they say that officials from the health board and the Department of Health and Children gave them what they were entitled to? They were denied that.</P>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy Ring said. The same abuse is now occurring in the housing aid for the elderly scheme, where there is a demand being placed on applicants for these important repairs but the health boards will not provide them unless the applicants can come up with parallel funding. That practice must stop immediately because the same problem will arise in the future. That is not appropriate and it cannot continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has stated, the report of the Ombudsman is to be welcomed. A report as critical as this may not make for pleasant reading. Nonetheless it is incumbent on all of us to take on board the criticisms levelled and learn from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, placed on record last night his apologies to people who were adversely affected by the operation of the scheme since 1993, I notice he was the only one to do so. I too take the opportunity to express my regret to all adversely affected. However, I must comment on the debate last night during which it was said it was <Col N="842" /> expected the Minister would accept the failings that occurred within his Department over a number of years. It is incumbent on all of us to remember this scheme has been in operation under more that one Administration and the speakers last night are representatives of political parties whose membership includes people who themselves have been Ministers for Health since the introduction of the subvention scheme.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that this Government has provided significantly increased funding for the development of services for older people from £10 million in 1997 to an additional £36 million in 2000, including nursing home subvention funding, while in 2001 an additional £57.427 million will be provided.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, on which the Ombudsman recently published a report, came into effect on 1 September 1993. This legislation has two principal objectives first, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and, second to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
    <P>Initially £4 million was allocated for the scheme when it was introduced in 1993. An additional £14 million has been made available in 2001 for the nursing home subvention scheme, bringing the total available for the scheme to £52 million.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Ombudsman on the nursing home subvention scheme deals with the role of the Department of Health and Children in making regulations and in overseeing the introduction of the scheme. It examines the administration of the scheme by the health boards and considers the nature of the relationship between the Oireachtas and the Executive, and within the Executive, and also the relationship between the political and administrative levels.</P>
    <P>I understand and fully support the Minister's immediate priority is ensuring that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. These were the subject of critical comment in the Ombudsman's report.</P>
    <P>As Members know, article 8.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid. The payment due from an additional allocation of £4 million was made available in 1998 to six of the eight health boards, where the regulations were applied incorrectly, to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and subsequent regulations. The funding was also used to address the additional problem of family circumstances regulations in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Department has instructed the relevant boards to take immediate steps to pay all out<Col N="843" /> standing arrears. To date, approximately £900,000 has been paid in respect of article 8.2 arrears. The Department is continuing to pursue this matter with the health boards concerned to ensure every effort will be made to pay all outstanding arrears as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the ability of adult sons and/or daughters of older people who apply for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. Deputy Ryan alleged last night that the regulations have not been amended since 1996.</P>
    <P>This report is not one in which anyone involved emerges unscathed. It has implications for all concerned, Legislature and civil servants alike. It should not be used, however, as a political football, with people rushing to point the finger. Everybody who was a Member of this Oireachtas since 1993 has a responsibility in relation to the issues raised in this report. I take no satisfaction in the acknowledgement by the Ombudsman that actions have been taken by my Department. This report makes uncomfortable reading for us all and I look forward to further discussion on, and examination of, its contents.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Boylan and Gay Mitchell. I thank Deputy Mitchell for giving us the opportunity to discuss this very important issue. I was glad to hear the Minister saying he is sorry and that the report makes for very difficult reading. Many families were put under extraordinary pressure through the years to make funds available to keep their relations in nursing homes. Unfortunately, while this report deals with the past, the current situation is not much better. Up until April 1994 those in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan benefited from the fact that many of our elderly could be kept free of charge north of the Border once they had a pension book, and at the time we received an excellent service with little cost to the State. I remember dealing with an officer of the health board who would not allow a Cavan patient cross the Border into a home in Clones, County Monaghan, as she said patients could not cross the county borders. However, she was quietly getting a person across the Border to accommodation in Enniskillen. While I would like to think the same EU and international regulations apply to the entire island, the placing of a person in a home in Northern Ireland with no cost to the State was good for the health board but we do not like to see a person being removed from their own family area where they want to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has many questions to answer in terms of the money it is spending on the winter bed initiative. They have pumped money into the acute hospital service with a demand to have beds made available regardless of cost. I understand beds which are being utilised by health boards through community services, <Col N="844" /> costing £200 each, are being bought out of the system at up to £500 just so it can be said something is being done. The running of the services begs many questions. Personnel at local level should be allowed use their own initiative to get these things at the lowest possible cost and I urge the Minister to review the entire system. It is unthinkable that a bed in a nursing home, which could be lying idle under the winter bed initiative, is costing the State up to £500, whereas a bed beside it is costing the State £200. It is unforgivable for the system to allow that to happen. While we need to look at the report of the Ombudsman, it is also necessary to examine what is currently happening.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the years ahead suggest that in my constituency 750 beds will be necessary in the service by 2010. Currently there are only about 470 beds. There is a need to build nursing homes in Monaghan, Cootehill and other areas to ensure that deficits where they exist are addressed, and that they are run at a minimum cost to the State. Intervention is great as it allows private homes to be used, but in many cases it costs a great deal and the way some of the systems are being run gives rise to many questions.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across the case of a man in Navan hospital who was there as a result of a hip injury. He had a hip replacement and he and his family were warned leaving there that he would need physiotherapy from the first day he arrived in Monaghan general hospital. However, there was no bed for him there and after a few days they moved him into a private winter bed. That bed costs the State approximately £500 and yet no physiotherapy is available. Although that man is eligible for health care and has no means the family have to find money to pay the physiotherapist.</P>
    <P>The issue needs to be re-examined. The Ombudsman report is important, as it tells us the history, but we certainly have a great deal to learn from the present as well.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Fine Gael spokesman on health, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for bringing this issue to the Dáil. It is with a sense of outrage that I speak about what has been discussed here last night and tonight. I thank Mr. Jody Corcoran of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> for bringing it to public attention in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report makes harrowing reading and it will not be good enough in this House, if the people involved in the systematic abuse and exploitation of old people are allowed to hide behind the Ombudsman's report or this debate. They must be named and shamed. They knew what they were doing. They had vulnerable people, unable to defend themselves, people placed in care by their families in the belief that they were in safe hands and would get good care, and they took their pocket money from them, the few shillings they had to give them independence in what was, for them, a strange place, to buy sweets or a packet of biscuits or perhaps ciga<Col N="845" /> rettes. How low can we get? Do we turn a blind eye to it? The people will not allow this to go by. People are annoyed and outraged that this happened.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at backbench Government Deputies complimenting the Government on refunding the money. What else would it do but return the money? It does not belong to it. It was stolen in the first place. It was a criminal&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should not point the finger. He is currently in the relevant position. Let him call an election now, let us over to the Government side of the House and we will deal with it properly. The carry-on coming out of Dublin Castle at present happened because good men turned a blind eye. They knew what was happening. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye in this instance. We must deal with it. We must make sure it does not happen again.</P>
      <P>I am proud that the North Eastern Health Board is not implicated. I would have been extremely disappointed. People from within and outside of my county and constituency have to go outside the North Eastern Health Board area for nursing care. I would like to know they are in safe hands.</P>
      <P>The people involved in this criminal activity must pay a penalty. It should involve community work, but it cannot involve the care of the elderly. They must be made to pay. They cannot expect to get away with it nor should they get away with it if we are to be serious about retaining our good name.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight the great nursing care given in one of the country's oldest institutions, that of St. Phelim's Hospital in Cavan town. It is a marvellous, wonderful place, a health board run hospital that has given marvellous care. It is a pity that could not be repeated nation wide and people could feel safe and secure and know that, in their retiring years they would be well looked-after and not abused.</P>

      <P>ALONE estimates that 88,000 Irish people over the age of 65 spend Christmas day on their own. This is a scandalous indictment of society. Government services must lead the way in showing respect and support for older people. What we have seen in this case is that Government services and agencies, knowing that they have not got lawful authority, not only did not lead the way in support of those elderly people but misused their powers in a way that ill-treated vulnerable, elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has come in here and tabled an amendment commending the Government for the decision to pay all outstanding arrears due to the <Col N="846" /> people. I will not accept that amendment. I could not possibly commend the Government for its actions.</P>
    <P>Until January 2001 the Department of Health and Children denied it was responsible and claimed it had advice from the Attorney General to show it was not responsible. It certainly had not indicated that it would make full repayments. Not only must the repayments be made but it is mean to suggest that it is in order to repay, retrospectively, only that which was withheld. What should be paid back to these people is their money with interest.</P>
    <P>The Government ran a £6,000 billion surplus last year. What would a couple of hundred thousand pounds interest cost the State one way or the other? The decent and right thing is not to come in here and, under pressure from the Opposition, show a sincere face and say sincere words to the effect that the Government is sorry. Let the Government show its sorrow. Pay back the money in full with interest to those people. It was their money, taken from them unlawfully. It was immoral to take that money from them. Were it not for the Ombudsman we would not be in the position to know that, as he went into that in great detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer in his speech, nor did the Minister of State this evening refer to the delays encountered by the Ombudsman, caused by the refusal of the health boards and the Department of Health and Children to respond to his inquiries in a timely way. They tried to frustrate the work of the Ombudsman, appointed by this House to uphold the rights of the citizens of the State. The Government of the day and the Department of Health and Children of the day frustrated the Ombudsman and did not come forward with the information in a timely way to help him indict them as he has done. It is indicative of the uncaring attitude of the current Government that the Minister attempted to cover up his responsibilities in the few words he put on the record last night.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Health and Children was not responsible and claims it was the health boards and they did not know and that the Minister did not know, it was not until December, 1999&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Minister, if he was sincere about showing respect for those elderly people and implementing the strategy which his Department says it has, he would repay the money with interest. The coffers of the State are full with money. Those people should get that money back with interest. If they sue, those people will, <Col N="848" /> through the courts, get that money back with interest.</P>
    <P>It is Fine Gael policy that there should be a covenant of rights and responsibilities between the providers of health care services and the citizens of the state. This report, this indictment, clearly underlines the need for a signed covenant of rights and responsibilities between an identified person on behalf of the State and the citizen.</P>
    <P>If the Ombudsman, with all the responsibilities he has across all the Departments, State agencies, local authorities and health boards, can come up with such an indictment, what would an ombudsman specifically dedicated to health issues find? I call on the Minister to appoint a full-time ombudsman for health and to create a covenant of rights and responsibilities which that person will oversee. If such action were taken, we would find that what has happened and was highlighted in the Ombudsman's report is not the exception but rather the practice. The people are being abused by a health system presided over by that Minister. The smile will be wiped off the Minister's face, the Mercedes will be taken away and the time will come when he will have to face the electorate and answer for the mishandling of the health services during his tenure of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter following continuous and strong representations from constituents who find it difficult to provide for children in third level education because they have gone over the strict maintenance grant limits as operated by local authorities. In many cases the threshold has been exceeded by only a small amount.</P>
      <P>The fact that inflation has risen by about 5.5% has added to the woes of these families and many will have to abandon their cherished ambition of seeing their children realise their potential. It is becoming more apparent that, unless the Minister of State takes immediate action to raise the thresholds, we will once again have a two tier education system with low paid families having to suffer the tragedy of their children being unable to enter third level education.</P>
      <P>One only has to look at newspapers to see the rise in the costs of accommodation, travel and food. The main costs associated with keeping children in third level education are increasing. However, the Department of Education and Children continues to bury its head in the sand and is failing to recognise the danger of a divided society as far as third level education is concerned.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is paid up to the age of 19 but, in many cases, is of no financial assistance to a family. Will the Department give a commitment to these families? Will the Minister of State investigate the financial hardship being inflicted on these families because of his intransigence in not raising the limits for the grants system?</P>
      <P>Accommodation is difficult to find and is more difficult to pay for. Travel is also expensive and, in many cases, is a necessity as many families like to have their children home at weekends or are only able to obtain five day lodgings for them. In some cases children have to work long hours in pubs and clubs at weekends to obtain finance to support themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country is awash with money yet it is hard to believe we are depriving some and making it difficult for many to fulfil their basic right to education. Is this right? The next generation, the students of today, will not forgive us for depriving them of this right, and rightly so. This is the only <Col N="851" /> opportunity they will have to realise their potential.</P>
    <P>The grants system is meagre enough without a situation whereby, because of the PPF, families are over the threshold. Not only should the thresholds be raised but a major review of the funding available should also be undertaken. Low income families are facing a nightmare because a son or daughter may have been successful in second level education yet cannot go to third level because of financial constraints.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Department faces up to the problem. I have heard nothing from the Minister for Education and Science about alleviating this problem despite the fact that the USI and others have raised this issue. I have been inundated with applications seeking an increase in the thresholds and the grant payments. If this does not happen, children will lose out and we will return to the situation which existed in the 1950s and 1960s where only the rich could obtain third level education and everyone else had to forgo the chance or get a trade. The Minister of State should give a commitment on this matter. It is imperative this is done as a matter or urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it gives me the opportunity to set out the position regarding this matter. The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants to assist students attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. Last June, in line with this policy, the Minister for Education and Science announced an increase of 5% in the qualifying income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. The allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study was also increased by 5%.</P>
      <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 2000-01 academic year is £20,200. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a 50% part maintenance grant in respect of which the income limit is £21,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the practice in recent years has been to increase the rates of third level maintenance grants annually in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, the Minister announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation for purposes of the annual review is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than <Col N="852" /> the reference value as the CPI to mid-February 2000 was 4.3%.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced late last year that he was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins the Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard, there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In September last, the Minister established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. The report of the action group, which the Minister will shortly receive, will offer advice on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. The Minister will make a further announcement in this regard when he has had time to fully consider the contents and recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>As an indication of this Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, the Minister announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows &ndash; from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. I trust this information puts this matter in context for the Deputy and the Members of this House.</P>

      <P>I wish to outline to the Minister the reality of what is happening in my area on the north side of Dublin. I can give six examples of cases in the past six weeks where the health service has dismally failed to meet the requirements the public should expect. Only this week I met a woman who is 71 years of age and who has been waiting five weeks for a cataract operation. She is almost blind. She finally got an appointment two weeks ago but then it was cancelled at short <Col N="853" /> notice and she will not get another one for a month. I had another case of a seriously ill 82 year old woman who was brought into the accident and emergency department. She had to wait two days on a trolley before she was admitted. I had a case of a pensioner with leukaemia and a blood clotting disorder who was ordered to be admitted immediately after an ECG in Beaumont Hospital. She had to go to the accident and emergency department where she waited 34 hours before being admitted. Another case is that of a woman with a two inch cavity in her skull who is waiting for neurosurgery. She has been told her case is not urgent and she will have to wait years for attention. An adult who is seeking to get his or her first referral to an ENT consultant in the Mater Hospital will have to wait 19 months.</P>
      <P>When the Minister responded to the publication of this report he said there was nothing new in it. If he is serious that there is nothing new in this catalogue of cases he must accept that the health services on the north side have collapsed and that we are failing to deliver to a standard that is acceptable in 2001 when the Celtic tiger is supposed to be delivering great opportunities. They are not being delivered to people in their declining years who need care.</P>
      <P>That survey I carried out over a period of two months shows the reality of under-investment in the service. There has been a 20% increase in the number of people over 65 years of age on the north side of Dublin in the past decade. During that period we have seen a decline in the number of public beds available to treat them. Not surprisingly, waiting lists for public surgery have soared. They are up 45% in Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital in the past three years. Almost 60% of those on the waiting lists in those two hospitals must wait more than the time assigned by the Government as the standard that should be met. One in six patients stay in casualty departments in excess of 24 hours waiting for treatment. Some 30% of cases which are designated as urgent by the triage nurse when they are admitted cannot be seen within four hours. Nursing staff is turning over at a phenomenal rate. There is a staff turnover of 25% across those hospitals and that rises to 30% in casualty departments. People are leaving because they are stressed out as they cannot deliver a service to the professional standards required.</P>
      <P>There is a serious problem of inequity and a two-tier system. The survey I did showed that private patients receive 60% more elective surgery treatments than public patients in the northside hospitals, although private patients are a smaller part of the population and they have lower health needs against any standard. The two tier health service is alive and well and thriving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have a clear commitment to a strategic plan to deal with these issues. It is not enough to have stop gap measures, such as those the Minister announced this year where he is taking nursing home beds from a system on the <Col N="854" /> north side. There is a 43% shortage of nursing home beds per head of population compared to the rest of the health board area. Yet the Minister will take away the few available nursing home beds and assign them to hospital work. We need serious investment in this system. This study includes a set of realistic proposals, many of which could be achieved in the short term. Rather than the Minister saying there is nothing new in it, I would like to see action on some of these practical proposals by people working at the coalface.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. We are in the process of preparing a strategic plan on the development of our health services. I initiated that process. A significant infrastructure is being put in place to ensure widespread consultation with all stakeholders in the health service and with the public so they have a significant input into that health strategy. We will announce further details in that regard shortly.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of health and social services, which includes accident and emergency services, in the eastern region rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The improvement of accident and emergency services in the region has already been identified as a priority matter for the authority and it has established a dedicated team to review services in the region as a whole. From this review the authority intends to put forward a comprehensive policy for accident and emergency services which it expects will overcome many of the problems currently experienced in accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>The authority will be seeking to redress any imbalance in emergency care in terms of access, appropriateness and quality. In particular, the review will examine issues such as the physical and human resource requirements to reduce waiting times for treatment and admission in accident and emergency departments. The review will also seek to improve emergency access to treatment through a detailed examination of policies, procedures and protocols for emergency services. It will also consider the provision of alternative care options for persons presenting with minor injuries. These options will include general practitioner out of hours services in community or hospital settings.</P>
      <P>For patients who require admission to hospital, the shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough to cater for new patients requiring admission to the hospital, particularly those in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is committed to ensuring that hospitals are in a position to respond to the need for their services, particularly during periods of peak demand. In recent years my Department has allocated significant additional funding to hospitals providing accident and emergency ser<Col N="855" /> vices, particularly in the eastern region, to enable them to continue to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing difficulties experienced in their accident and emergency departments. These initiatives include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step-down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment/observation areas in accident and emergency departments and improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion. Part of the additional funding is used to fund a public education campaign aimed at increasing public awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments with a particular emphasis on persuading persons with minor ailments to attend their general practitioner rather than an accident and emergency department in an acute hospital.</P>
    <P>At national level I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. That is the type of strategic review in which we are currently engaged. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The interim findings of the review have been presented to Government and they have identified a range of short to medium-term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. Further work is now being undertaken to develop a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The second phase of the review will be completed in late spring.</P>
    <P>As part of the review, I announced in October 2000 a £25 million investment package to help alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter period. The investment package was targeted at a number of key areas, including approval to recruit 29 additional accident and emergency consultants, approval to recruit 15 additional consultant anaesthetists, provision for the contracting of at least 500 additional nursing home places for patients who have completed the acute phase of treatment, provision of additional aids and supports for older persons, the development of a new acute assessment unit at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and the provision of a number of minor injury and respiratory units in the eastern region. The appointment of additional consultants is under way and the advertisements have been placed. This is about putting senior decision makers in all our accident and emergency departments. That is the largest significant investment in accident and emergency or in any speciality at any one time. The provision of medical appliances and aids is to try to facilitate the discharge of older persons <Col N="856" /> from hospital and back into the community where supports are required.</P>
    <P>We have provided £10 million to the ERHA to alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter period 2000-01. That package included provision for the contracting of private nursing home beds which facilitates the discharge of patients to convalescence care. I also recently gave approval to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to purchase St. Joseph's private hospital in Raheny in Dublin. Subject to the completion of the sale between the parties involved, additional funding under the national development plan is being allocated to the ERHA to fund the purchase.</P>
    <P>A range of services is being considered for the site, including the provision of specialist and day care services with the aim of reducing the number of public patients currently on waiting lists for treatment. The purchase of St. Joseph's will facilitate additions to the range of services currently being provided by the Northern Area Health Board and other public health service providers in the area.</P>
    <P>The decision to purchase St. Joseph's Hospital is evidence of my commitment, and that of the Government, to address bed capacity deficits in the region and in the health service overall.</P>
    <P>We are well aware of the difficulties and of the need to significantly improve accessibility to acute hospital services in general and particularly those on the northside of Dublin. We are definitely taking concrete steps to improve the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on this issue in this Chamber before and I wish to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Office of the Ceann Comhairle, for allowing me raise it again.</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with the story which is that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is proposing to remove testing facilities in the Cork centre which serves the Munster region, and have a single testing site in Dublin. I am not a medical person but having spoken to doctors and others involved in delivering medical services in the Munster region, I am alarmed at their objection to such a move. They have steadfastly opposed it, saying it is wrong, not in the interests of patient safety and that it could threaten patients' lives. That is an alarming statement to hear from consultants, doctors and other medical staff involved in delivering health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to media reports today, over 250 consultants and doctors have written to the Mini<Col N="857" /> ster asking him to intervene to ensure that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service will continue to provide two testing centres. They do not have confidence in the Dublin centre and they believe that it would be a retrograde step to close the Cork facility. The system in Cork is working well and has an ISO 2000 standard. There is a strong body of opinion that says it should not be changed if it is working well.</P>
    <P>The IBTS's claim that the plan to reduce testing to a single site facility in Dublin will provide a better service is not being believed in Munster. Over the past two years, there have been numerous incidents where the blood service in Cork has been called upon to assist medical services outside the Munster region. The Minister has stated publicly that he cannot intervene in this matter, but he should do so in the interests of public health and safety to ensure that the testing centre in Cork is not removed or downgraded. Confidence in the blood service must be restored.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Southern Health Board passed a motion of no confidence in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. Today, 250 consultants and doctors demanded that the situation should not change. Following the motion passed by the Southern Health Board, this is a stark warning from the medical profession that it does not have confidence in the system. This situation must compel the Minster to act in the interests of patient safety.</P>
    <P>Many other issues are involved in this matter. When I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, it examined the situation and produced a report recommending that two blood testing centres should be maintained. It also made a strong recommendation that differences within the Irish Blood Transfusion Service should be addressed in the interest of developing public confidence in our blood services. That has not happened, however, and the report has been ignored. Note should be taken of such a report by a committee of this House. I was surprised and alarmed by the reaction of the IBTS to that report.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to intervene in this matter, even though he has said that he cannot do so. He has said it is a matter for the IBTS itself, but the fact is there is public alarm because the medical profession in Cork and elsewhere in Munster says the decision is wrong. They have not criticised the proposed decision lightly. They are highlighting the fact that downgrading the blood services in Cork would be a bad step affecting patient safety and their ability to deliver health services in the Munster region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for having raised this issue. Transfusion services are continuing to undergo rapid change to meet the demands of improved quality and safety, and to meet the changes in the demand for products. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service has adapted to change in line with international developments. In fact, the IBTS today is very different to the service <Col N="858" /> which failed in the past. This is as a result of the recruitment of new skills and expertise in recent years and the considerable investment which my Department has made in improving the IBTS at all levels, including the Cork centre.</P>
      <P>The service is also fully focused on the changes which are taking place internationally to ensure that it is in a position to respond early and comprehensively to new tests, technology and new quality assurance requirements. The IBTS has been ahead of a considerable number of EU transfusion centres in introducing new tests and processes such as leucodepletion and PCR testing.</P>
      <P>One of the major effects of such rapid change has been a considerable reduction in the number of products manufactured or made available by the IBTS, including anti-D, albumin and plasma based factors 7 and 8, used in the treatment of persons with haemophilia, which have been replaced with recombinant products.</P>
      <P>The IBTS is also actively considering the following changes: a proposal to cease manufacturing cryoprecipitate because a replacement product from a non-BSE risk country is available and is being sourced; a proposal to replace its fresh frozen plasma with a commercially available product which is manufactured from US volunteer plasma which is BSE free and a proposal to seek supplies of red cells from transfusion centres which are outside BSE risk areas.</P>
      <P>The situation is further complicated by the continuing decline in the use of blood in our hospitals, despite the increase in hospital activity. The number of units of blood issued by the IBTS has reduced from 159,000 in 1996 to 145,000 in 2000. This is a drop of approximately 10%. The IBTS considers that efficiency measures, such as reducing outdating in the IBTS and in hospitals, would reduce that figure by a further 8,000 units in the immediate short-term.</P>
      <P>A national blood users group, established by my predecessor, whose membership comprises blood user experts from hospitals nationally, has prepared &ldquo;A Guideline for the Transfusion of Red Blood Cells in Surgical Patients&rdquo;. The guideline states that the use of proven strategies that reduce exposure to donated blood should be made widely available and applied where appropriate. Such strategies include autologous transfusion techniques and surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological approaches that reduce blood loss.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently making this guideline available to all hospitals, general practitioners and medical schools. The implementation of this guideline throughout the health services will further reduce dependency on red cells. Patients will also have access to other strategies which do not depend on red cell transfusion. The IBTS considers that the combination of these measures will result in a further substantial reduction in the volume of red cells transfused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The above developments will have repercussions for the core business of the IBTS. Many <Col N="859" /> key questions arise concerning the organisational structure of the IBTS and what the impact of the changes that are coming downstream fairly quickly will be on the role and function of the IBTS, and how we can use the skills and expertise within the organisation to meet these particular challenges.</P>
    <P>This is where the real debate about our transfusion services should take place. A debate on traditional geographic lines, which sees Dublin and Cork as separate or competing elements, is not the way forward. This is not a platform on which to develop a national transfusion service in a rapidly changing environment. By that I mean that the days of saying the Cork centre will give blood to somewhere outside Cork or Waterford should&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter where the blood is generated, we should help out. That is the kind of thing I want to see happening. The IBTS took a decision in 1999 to have a single testing site for the country which would be based in Dublin. This decision has caused considerable controversy and has led, along with other issues, to a breakdown in relations between the IBTS and the wider medical community in Cork, to which the Deputy alluded. I have had numerous meetings with representatives of the staff and interested parties in Cork, and with the IBTS itself, and I am very much aware of the anxiety felt by all concerned.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, there has been considerable additional investment in the Cork centre. A new components laboratory has been provided at a cost of approximately £500,000. A second consultant post has been approved. New posts in quality assurance and IT have been approved in recent years. Furthermore, at its meeting in January, the board of the IBTS approved a draft planning brief for a new transfusion centre in Cork for submission to my Department. My Department will reply to this request shortly with a view to providing a new state of the art facility in Cork as a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IBTS operates in a fast moving and challenging area of the health system in which there is a full and demanding role for the board, management and the entire staff of the organisation at all levels. There is a responsibility on all concerned to resolve the difficulties which exist between the Cork centre of the IBTS and its national headquarters to ensure a truly national <Col N="860" /> service and to progress with its core business of developing best transfusion practice for the future. Recent public disagreements between the IBTS and the Southern Health Board are not conducive to the effective co-operation and partnership between complementary organisations which is to be expected and which prevails generally in the health system. This is all the more regrettable at present when the energies of the IBTS and hospitals generally should be focused on developing best transfusion practice, including important strategies to address the possible risk of the transmission of the vCJD by blood transfusion.</P>
    <P>I understand the board at its meeting in January decided to engage external human resource expertise to assist in achieving a resolution of current problems and to establish an improved platform on which to move forward. I welcome this initiative and urge all concerned to fully engage in this process. It is only by such engagement that a resolution can be found to the complex issues which surround this problem.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Stardust Disaster.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fire at the Stardust which occurred this very night 20 years ago was one of the most shocking and horrific disasters to ever hit our city. Certain events etched in all our memories will stay with us until the day we die and the Stardust fire falls into this category. Nobody who lived in Dublin in 1981 will ever forget where they were when the heard of the disaster. The loss of 48 young lives and the maiming of so many others left a huge emotional scar on the city and nowhere was the pain and sense of loss more deeply felt than in the area I represent. Most of the victims were drawn from a relatively small geographical area in the parishes of Bonnybrook, Kilmore, Darndale, Priorswood and Artane. These people were members of the same families, kids who had gone to school together and workmates enjoying themselves on a St. Valentine's Day night out and they burned or suffocated to death in the most horrific circumstances trapped behind barred windows.</P>
      <P>The sense of loss and anguish has been compounded by the belief that those responsible for the deaths of these people, those who put profit before the safety of the public, were not ever properly called to account for their actions and that the loss and suffering of the community in this area was never properly acknowledged by the State. In the aftermath of the Stardust disaster with the massive outpouring of grief, there appeared, initially at least, a real determination that a disaster like this would never be allowed to happen again but 20 years on, there is much to suggest that the lessons of the Stardust have still not been learned and that a similar disaster could well occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 20 years on, some of the key findings of the tribunal of inquiry have still not been implemented. As the chairman of the Chief Fire <Col N="861" /> Officers' Association, Mr. Michael Fitzsimons, said, regulations are being broken in public venues throughout the country every night of the week, and probably this very night. He said fire services are creaking and that they do not have the personnel to inspect premises and that the public is not getting as good a service as it thinks. The four Dublin local authorities have had ongoing complaints from fire fighters about the state of readiness of the fire engine fleet and ancillary equipment.</P>
    <P>Some 20 years on, ten local authorities have still not approved fire and emergency operation plans. Three councils &ndash; Limerick Corporation, Athlone UDC and Dundalk UDC &ndash; have not drawn up any plans and seven other local authorities, including Dublin Corporation, have yet to approve their plans, although they have been prepared. This failure to implement any of these recommendations is hardly consistent with the pledges we heard from those in authority that the lessons of the Stardust would be learned and that a disaster like this would not ever be allowed to happen. The chief fire officer drew our attention to the fact that there were supposed to be extra powers for fire chiefs in relation to the management of buildings, including overcrowding. There has not been any attempt in the past 20 years to set up a national fire safety training centre.</P>
    <P>In recent days, we have read through many valuable media articles on the continuing suffering of the families of Stardust victims and survivors. There is a deep resentment that the compensation paid to victims families and survivors was far too low. When we note that only £7,500 was paid for every young person who died, it seems obvious that people from one of the most disadvantaged districts in our State were treated without any real respect. The profound emotional and physical suffering of survivors and victims' families in the past 20 years still needs an official response. We have heard from that remarkable woman, Ms Chrissie Keegan, and her daughters, that there are still profound needs for counselling, medical and general financial assistance and other needs for the victims and survivors &ndash; at least 200 to 300 people in all. I call on this Minister to respond to these profound needs of Stardust victims and survivors. The heroic struggle waged by Chrissie, her late husband John and her committee resulted in the construction of our wonderful Stardust Memorial Park and the beautiful memorial sculpture to our tragic young people who died.</P>
    <P>However, the greater Coolock area is still hugely disadvantaged. Third level attendance from the Dublin 17 postal district remains the lowest in the country. There are still huge recreational needs for our young Coolock boys and girls and men and women, as I constantly tell the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform saw at first hand the extent of the major and embedded anti-<Col N="862" /> social problems, such as joyriding and addiction problems in parts of the area I represent. At a local level, therefore, the best enduring memorial to the tragic 48 youngsters of my area would be to provide full support for the recreational and educational needs of the present generation of young Coolock people.</P>
    <P>Today on the news, the Minister for Health and Children seemed to defend large packed drinking venues when he said he was against bar deregulation. Any urban representative in this House will say that terrible overcrowding still occurs and often in the large drinking factories of Dublin's northside and outer suburbs. Recently, there was the horrible disaster at Lillies Bordello, a club near this House.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, the lessons of the Stardust must be learned. As the families of those who lost their lives mark the 20th anniversary of the loss of their loved ones in Clonshaugh tonight, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must now take immediate steps to ensure that all of the outstanding recommendations of the tribunal are implemented and that never again will the lives of so many young people be lost. I also call on the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government to respond generously to the ongoing needs of the victims' families and survivors and to the needs of the 50,000 of the greater Coolock area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, regrets that he is unable to be in the House to respond to this matter and has asked me to do so on his behalf. I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to speak on this important issue. Sadly, the Stardust fire in which 48 young people tragically lost their lives needs no introduction on this its 20th anniversary.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of fire and emergency operations plans. These plans, which are required under section 26 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, deal with the organisation, equipment, training and other operational matters required for fire and other emergency situations. While 23 authorities have submitted their plans, ten fire authorities are non-compliant. The Department recently reminded the non-compliant authorities of their statutory obligations in this matter. I stress the very important and clear distinction between section 26 plans and major emergency plans. All local authorities have major emergency plans which set out the arrangements for mobilising and co-ordinating the emergency response to any event which causes or threatens death or injury, serious disruption of essential services or damage to property on a scale beyond the normal capabilities of the Garda, local authorities and health services. Local authorities test and update these plans as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the issue of resources available to fire authorities to inspect premises for non-compliance with fire safety regulations. <Col N="863" /> The national building regulations were made in 1991 and became operative on 1 June 1992. These apply to new buildings and to extensions or material alterations of existing buildings. Responsibility for compliance with the building regulations is the responsibility of the designer, builder and owner of a building. Enforcement of the regulations is primarily the responsibility of the local building control authorities. On taking office, the Minister was concerned about the low level of local enforcement of the building code. Accordingly, he has taken a number of measures designed to assist the authorities meet the inspection target of 12 per cent to 15 per cent of all new buildings set by the City and County Managers Association in 1993, including sanctioning the appointment of building control officers and additional staff and increasing building control fees, with effect from 1 July 1998, in order to boost local funding for stricter enforcement.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report to the House that these measures are bearing fruit. About 85 per cent of authorities are now carrying out inspections and about two-thirds of the authorities have reached the inspection target level of 12 per cent to 15 per cent of developments. The Minister has made it clear to building control authorities that the balance must be on target by 30 June next.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, fire authorities have enforcement/prosecution powers under the Fire Services Act, 1981, including the right to inspect premises and to serve a fire safety notice on the person in control, if appropriate. It is entirely a matter for the fire authority to determine the appropriate exercise of their functions under the Fire Services Act, 1981, including the provision of sufficient resources to carry out these functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> The 1982 report of the Stardust tribunal made a wide range of recommendations in relation to the fire service and other related matters. All of these recommendations have received full and careful consideration and have either been implemented or taken into account in the intervening period. Improvements have been carried out on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the local fire service, its organisation and staffing, training, the legislative framework, and emergency planning.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very positive developments in the fire service over the past 20 years, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, when speaking to the media recently announced that he is conscious of some difficulties emerging in the delivery of fire safety and emergency services in the past few years. He referred in particular to the changing role of the service and to changes in the economic and social circumstances in which the service operates, giving rise to both recruitment and staffing difficulties. Another factor that impinges on the service at this time is the changing agenda in the public service. In the light of these issues, the Minister stated it is timely to commission a wide ranging strategic review of the fire service by independent consultants. The objective of the review will be to examine and report on the arrangements to ensure that people, property and the environment are protected from fire and other emergencies by the provision of quality fire safety and emergency services. The consultants' report will help to develop policy for the future direction of the service and ensure we can go forward, building on the real strengths of today.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 37 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify any confusion arising from the description of the capabilities for the EU Headline Goal as a Rapid Reaction Force. The response capacity currently being developed by the EU, and frequently described as a Rapid Reaction Force, is emphatically not a standing army. It constitutes a catalogue of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out Petersberg tasks &ndash; tasks of crisis management, peacekeeping and humanitarian activities &ndash; the national elements of which can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor.</P>
      <P>The issue to which the Deputy refers was discussed between my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General in the context of last November's decision by the Government to authorise commitment by Ireland of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the EU Headline Goal for the purpose of possible future Petersberg Task operations. Ireland's political commitment to the EU Headline Goal did not give rise to any requirement to amend existing legislation. This remains the position and will not be affected by the Treaty changes recently agreed at Nice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards any potential EU Petersberg operation, in keeping with the Government's stated position in this area, I reiterate that Ireland will approach each mission on a case by case basis and only participate in operations authorised by the <Col N="866" /> UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The commitments made in relation to the EU Headline Goal must be seen in the context of Ireland's long-standing support for overseas peace support operations authorised by the United Nations. In this regard, the White Paper on Defence, published last year, set out key elements of the Government's approach to overseas peace support operations and I wish to refer to a number of the most important and relevant elements.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for a reshaping and re-equipping of the Defence Forces to ensure they are geared for the opportunities and challenges of the changing security and defence environment. This strategy embraces organisation, equipment, training and technology aspects. In this context, the White Paper contains the strategy for the Defence Forces strength and organisation for the next ten years and concluded that the Permanent Defence Force requires a strength of 10,500 personnel ready to fulfil current tasks at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the EU Headline Goal is to be met from within the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS, commitment of 850 members on overseas service at any time. The White Paper detailed existing equipment programmes, including that for 40 new armoured personnel carriers. Future equipment requirements are already the subject of examination within my Department by the high level civil-military planning and procurement group established under the White Paper and are being funded from within the existing procurement financial provisions and savings realised from the reduction in Permanent Defence Force personnel numbers and the sale of surplus properties. This programme will ensure that the Defence Forces are in a position to contribute to modern peace support operations.</P>
    <P>In relation to military training, the White Paper recognised that the primary focus of the Defence Forces, when not engaged in operations, is training and preparation. As a reflection of the evolving defence and security environment, increased emphasis will be placed on exercises stressing interoperability, procedures and doctrine.</P>

      <P>The ministerial air transport service is currently operated by the Air Corps using the Gulfstream IV execu<Col N="867" /> tive jet as the principal aircraft backed up by the Beechcraft King Air turboprop aircraft. The G IV was acquired in 1991. The Beechcraft provides only a limited MATS operation and it is also used for pilot training. Effectively it operates nationally, to the UK and, to a minor extent, to Europe.</P>
      <P>The issue of the replacement of the G IV Jet is under active consideration at present. The consideration is in the context of the increased level of business for Ministers and officials to Europe and further afield. The business of the European Union itself has grown by an unprecedented degree over the last decade both in the size of its market and in the depth and range of its activities. These changes have increased significantly the travel requirements of Ministers and officials.</P>
      <P>There is an ongoing requirement for the Government to maintain a very active involvement both bilaterally and through the EU and multilateral bodies like the United Nations, in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas to build Ireland's political and economic relations with countries from these regions. This requirement also involves substantial air travel by Ministers.</P>
      <P>The ministerial air transport service has been a major asset for successive Governments. The service has proved to be extremely flexible to meet the changing timetables of Ministers. In this regard I acknowledge the major role played by the Air Corps in operating the service effectively over the years. It is important that any action required to maintain the high standards set for the operation of the ministerial air transport service is taken. In that regard, all options which could improve the service available to the Government are being examined. No decisions have been made as yet but I expect to be in a position to bring a memorandum to Government within the next two months on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 72 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> Up to 31 January 2001 a total of 15,543 claims have been lodged and 7,210 settled by means of court awards and out of court settlements. A further 367 have been disposed of by withdrawals and dismissals leaving 7,966 still outstanding. Some £98.6 million, 122.9 million, has been paid to date in damages and a further £40.7 million, 51.7 million, paid in legal fees. In January 2001 the number of new hearing loss claims lodged was 61.</P>
    <P>On 25 January 2001 Mr. Justice Johnson agreed to an application on behalf of the State to adjourn hearing loss claims in the Dublin High Court. The adjournment takes effect from 5 February 2001 until 28 March 2001. Its continuation beyond that date will be dependent on the court being satisfied that any average of 150 cases per week can be settled under the early settlement scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to meet this target, my Department will endeavour to settle claims on a number of fronts. First, the Chief State Solicitor's office will engage in negotiations with plaintiffs' solicitors. During the year 2000, the Chief State Solicitor's office successfully negotiated settlements in 750 claims by way of direct negotiations with plaintiffs' solicitors and I am confident that they can build on this momentum. Second, my Department has directly engaged the services of five firms of loss adjusters who will act on an agency basis on behalf of the Chief State Solicitor in order to negotiate direct settlements with plaintiffs' solicitors. Third, a number of cases will continue to be listed for trial in the High Court outside Dublin as well as in the Circuit Court throughout the country. In addition, should the above system yield satisfactory levels of settlements, officials of my Department who have accumulated considerable experience dealing with these claims will engage in direct negotiations with plaintiffs' solicitors.</P>
    <P>I remain of the view that the early settlement scheme, which to date has settled 1,181 hearing loss claims, is the most efficient mechanism of disposing of the outstanding claims, if the scheme is allowed to develop.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>As I advised the House in December, the question of the appointment of an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the representative associations, provide that discussions at conciliation and arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on this issue.</P>
      <P>As the House will recall, I announced last October that I had decided the time was now ripe to proceed with the establishment of a legislative Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. It is important in establishing this office that we provide a credible grievance system which is fair to all members of the force. Discussions are taking place with both of the representative associations with a view to defining the scope and powers of a military Ombudsman in terms which will meet the divergent needs of the various parties. The discussion process is also likely to result in an updating of the existing internal complaints procedures. As soon as those discussions are completed, I will make the necessary legislative arrangements to give effect to the Ombudsman proposal.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remind the Deputies that under the provisions of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, military personnel already have the right to make complaints against my Department to the Ombudsman.</P>

      <P>For many years the Defence Forces operated a large fleet of Land Rovers, approximately 500. A level of Land Rover spare parts were kept in stores as part of the good management of the fleet. Between 1989 and 1998 the Land Rover fleet was replaced and the spare parts which were the subject of comment by the Comptroller and Auditor General were the residual stocks which were left in stores after the final phase out of the Land Rover. These stocks have been sold.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces has changed its stocking policy to a system that keeps stock levels to a minimum for all stores which are freely available on the market. Previously, these stocks were purchased on a bulk basis in order to benefit from bulk discounts. In addition, measures are now being put in place to ensure that all store managers in the Defence Forces arrange for the prompt disposal of obsolete stocks.</P>

In consultation with the NATO secretariat, an individual partnership programme has been developed for the year 2001 which sets out the level and extent of proposed participation in such areas as co-operation in peacekeeping principles, doctrine, training, exercises and interoperability in peacekeeping operations.</P>
      <P>Ireland's involvement in PfP in the year 2001 will focus on the enhancement of current skills and expertise in such areas as operational and generic planning for peacekeeping and peace support, communications, command and control, operational procedures and logistics. This will take the form of participation at appropriate meetings, seminars and training courses. Ireland intends to participate in the PfP planning and review process, PARP, with a view to enhancing interoperability with our PfP partners in such areas as tactics, operational cohesion, logistics and language training. The aim is to create the conditions in which different contingents can work together efficiently and effectively. Ireland wishes to contribute its UN peacekeeping experience by playing an active part in the Petersberg Tasks in support of the European Union's CFSP. Ireland sees PfP in general, and the PARP in particular, as having a significant role in co-operation and planning for participation in such tasks.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever activities with which they may be tasked from time to time. In this regard, participation in PfP does not involve the imposition of any changes in Defence Forces training procedures and equipment. In the White Paper on Defence, published last year, the Government set out its strategy for defence covering the period up to 2010, based on the evolving national and international security environment. A major objective of this strategy, which embraces organisational, equipment, training and technology aspects, is the reshaping of our Defence Forces and the reallocation of resources to new equipment for the overseas peace support role in the context of modern peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper includes an investment programme for the Defence Forces involving an <Col N="872" /> additional £250 million in new equipment and infrastructure. A total of £55 million over three years has been allocated for the purchase of new aircraft for the Air Corps. A tender competition for the provision of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport is well advanced and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year. The building of the second new ship for the Naval Service, which is similar to LE <i>Róisín</i>, is well advanced and well ahead of schedule. As with LE <i>Róisín</i>, the new ship will also cost over £20 million. The ship is to be named the LE <i>Niamh</i> at the end of March and will arrive in the Naval Base, Haulbowline, in early May. Investment of this scale confirms that the White Paper represents a serious response by the Government to a sustained case advanced by the military authorities to develop the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation.</P>
    <P>In relation to military training, the White Paper recognised that the primary focus of the Defence Forces, when not engaged in operations, is training and preparation. As a reflection of the defence and security environment, including developments in relation to the PfP, increased emphasis will be placed on exercises stressing interoperability, procedures and doctrine. On the question of participation by Air Corps and Naval Service elements in the Partnership for Peace, the position has been that the bulk of overseas commitments have in the past been met by the Army and this position is likely to pertain for the future.</P>

    <P>Arising from the temporary provision of accommodation for asylum seekers, the cost of security at Magee barracks, Kildare, is now met by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Castleblayney military barracks was transferred to the North Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and no further costs will fall to be <Col N="873" /> met by my Department in relation to that property.</P>
    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to almost £812,000. In addition there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £136,000 in the case of Murphy barracks, Ballincollig.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 54 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, all of the safety recommendations set out in the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise, into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 2000, which call for action by the Department and the Defence Forces are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their immediate implementation. In this regard, I have put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The fourth meeting of the working group charged with overseeing the process was held recently in the Department of Defence, involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces and the flight safety officer of the Air Corps, as well a representative from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Progress reports from the various bodies involved were presented and reviewed and a composite progress report was prepared in the Department and presented to me. In this regard, I am pleased to announce that considerable progress is being reported by all bodies involved in the implementation of the recommendations. This group will continue to meet on a regular basis in order to ensure the speedy implementation of the safety recommendations set out in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the commissioning of an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps, I am pleased to report that the procedure for the selection of an appropriate agency to undertake this audit is under way. A specification was drawn <Col N="875" /> up by my Department in consultation with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Air Corps, and this is currently under consideration by a number of potential auditors. Initial responses have been received from six of these agencies and it is expected that responses will be received from all those approached by early next week. At that stage a likely time frame for the conduct of the audit will become clearer. All support necessary will be provided by my Department and the Defence Forces to the chosen agency to carry out its work.</P>

      <P>Following the submission of the White Paper on Defence to Government on 29 February 2000, the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force to 10,500, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence sets out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in Ireland for the next ten years. It involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
      <P>Substantial programmes of investment will take place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and some examples are as follows: </P>
      <P>The first two of the new fleet of 40 armoured personnel carriers for the Army, costing in total £40 million, were produced at the end of 2000 and officially handed over to the Department of Defence on 11 January 2001. All 40 vehicles will be delivered by January of next year almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
      <P>There has been significant investment in recent years on new vehicles for the Army with over £6.5m spent on specialist transport cargo vehicles deployed to KFOR, and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4s, and ¾ ton trucks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over £10.5m has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. An investment package for the Army estimated at up to £25 million over the next three years is under way. The package <Col N="876" /> includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces is also to commence immediately.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is well advanced and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>The building of the second new ship for the Naval Service, which is similar to LE <i>Róisín,</i> is well advanced and well ahead of schedule. As with LE <i>Róisín</i>, the new ship will also cost over £20 million. The ship is to be named at the end of March and will arrive in the naval base, Haulbowline, in early May.</P>
    <P>The new equipment programme is a top priority for me. It ensures that the Defence Forces will develop as a world class military organisation in which people are proud to serve. The Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will have the most modern equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 68 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. That group reported in September 1999. A thorough, comprehensive and in-depth study of the Reserve was undertaken, involving a very considerable amount of work both by a military board, established by the then Chief of Staff, and latterly by the steering group itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and also met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association.</P>
    <P>I formally launched the steering group report on 25 November 2000 at a special briefing for the southern region in Thurles, organised by the military authorities for serving members of the Reserve. A similar briefing for the western region took place in Athlone on 2 December 2000. A third briefing was held in Dublin on 14 December 2000. I am pleased that the various recommendations contained in the steering group report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed in the future.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a board has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the steering group recommendations. I am further advised that, under the aegis of this board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and An Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have now started upon that process by way of the series of three preliminary regional briefings late last year, and by the launch of the steering group report.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force, as envisaged by the steering group, will be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which will be based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and organisational changes will require about six years to bring to completion. The military authorities will consider and recommend detailed proposals for the restructuring of Reserve units within each brigade area and in the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper, one important change recommended by the study of the Reserve is that, in future, members of the Reserve should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions, subject to appropriate qualifications, availability and advance training. Service by comparable reservists on overseas peace support missions is quite common in other countries. However, the general criteria governing selection for overseas service are issues within the scope of representation. Therefore, any matters relating to proposals for future overseas service by members of the Reserve, which come within the scope of <Col N="878" /> representation, will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. In addition, the question of the security of civilian employment, for those members of the Reserve who may wish to serve overseas, will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level, the steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenant-colonel appointments within the Reserve, these appointments being part of the integrated element of the Reserve.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>An Slua Muirí will be developed to provide a genuine Naval Reserve capability based on a revised overall strength of up to 400 personnel. As a rationalisation measure, the two Dublin based companies of An Slua Muirí will be amalgamated. The Naval Service, in conjunction with the director of Reserve Forces, will formulate specific proposals to develop an integrated role for the reorganised An Slua Muirí.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps flight safety office is in operation and will be an intrinsic part of the new Air Corps organisational structure upon its formal implementation. I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organisation and this will be put in place once consultations with the representative associations, which are at an advanced stage, are completed. The flight safety officer of lieutenant colonel rank has been <Col N="879" /> appointed in the interim. The flight safety office will also have an officer of captain rank.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps flight safety officer's function is not solely to investigate incidents but also to monitor trends so as to identify hazards, which enable the organisation to put defences against such hazards in place. In addition the office provides advice through the chain of command on changes to current practices or the implementation of new practices.</P>
    <P>Since September 2000, the Air Corps flight safety officer has investigated three cases as a result of reports received and I will now outline the action taken in each case.</P>
    <P>The first case was in relation to impact damage, as a result of a ground incident, to the leading edge of the wing of the Gulfstream IV. The flight safety officer issued recommendations in relation to the use of ground handling equipment and these were accepted and implemented.</P>
    <P>The second case is in relation to the serious increase in bird activity around Casement Aerodrome and the consequent inherent risks involved. The flight safety officer has made recommendations in relation to methods of minimising and controlling this hazard and these are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>The flight safety officer is also involved in addressing the issue of military air space violations. There has been an increasing number of violations of the Baldonnel airspace by private light aircraft which have resulted in several reports of air proximity or airmiss incidents. This is a current issue and is being dealt with through the standing civil/military air navigation committee which comprises representatives from the Air Corps, the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Traffic Control Services.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps flight safety officer has also issued six internal flight safety notices, in order to raise awareness within the Air Corps on specific issues.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, the Air Corps flight safety office receives an increasing level of reports both through the confidential and open reporting system. These reporting systems are common practice in most military and civil flight safety systems. Many of the inputs received, in themselves do not comprise flight safety but they are entered by the flight safety officer on a database for trend analysis and frequency so as to identify hazards and make risk assessments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 62, 85, 104 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the number of personnel who have left the Defence Forces in the year 2000 and the strength of the Defence Forces at 31 December 2000, both male and female, are shown in the form of tabular statements which I propose to circulate with the Official Report. The strengths shown are the latest available from the military authorities.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies as required. I am satisfied that a vigorous continuance of this policy will ensure the maintenance of proper strengths at agreed levels in the Permanent Defence Force. It is proposed to enlist 1,000 personnel in the Permanent Defence Force from the 2001 recruitment campaign. The annual cadetship competition was advertised recently and it is proposed to offer 68 cadetships in the current year of which 12 will be Air Corps cadetships. It is proposed to hold a competition in the near future for 40 Air Corps apprenticeships. A proposal for the intake of a number of aeronautical engineers is being examined at present.</P>
      <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5 4. In previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 16% of all applicants have been female and <Col N="881" /> that on average 16% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>
    <P>The Government has now considered the final report from PricewaterhouseCoopers and have agreed in principle to the proposal that the State's future sea and air support requirements be discharged by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, on the basis of an appropriate mix of multi-tasking/multi-capabilities and dedicated services, and that Government decision-making on equipping and staffing of the Naval Service and the Air Corps should be made accordingly. The manpower levels of the Air Corps and Naval Service as provided for in the White Paper are in accordance with the report's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>My overall objective as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces it needs and that the Defence Forces continue to be an organisation in which people are proud to serve. That is the overall objective of the White Paper and I assure the House that implementation is moving ahead quickly and positively.</P>
      <P>The Chief of Staff is currently preparing a plan to restructure the PDF in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. That plan will help us to achieve the following broad goals: to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present; and to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
      <P>My intention is to have the plan finalised and implemented by end 2001, in accordance with the Government decision. It is important that we put the new organisation in place and move ahead with the modernisation of the Defence Forces. It is equally important that the new organisation offers rewarding and challenging careers to Defence Forces personnel. The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the preparation of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces integrated personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The Chief of Staff is currently drafting that plan and the process is well advanced. A key feature of the plan will be a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which is now in place in order to achieve an improved age profile in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the special study on the Air Corps undertaken by PriceWaterhousecoopers Consultants, and reflecting the policy parameters laid down in the White Paper, Air Corps management has submitted a draft implementation plan to me and I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organisation and this will be put in place following the completion of consultations <Col N="885" /> with the representative associations which are at an advanced stage. Meanwhile, other elements of the plan are being developed.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Air Corps, the Naval Service prepared a detailed implementation plan which I have approved. Implementation is proceeding, including putting in place the new organisation provided for in the plan.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides that the overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group which reported in 1999. The recommendations contained in the report give us a general basis on which to proceed. Last year I published the report of the steering group and launched a consultative process to seek the views of members of the reserve in advance of the drawing up of an implementation plan. It is estimated that the implementation of any necessary structural and organisational change will take a period of about six years.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased last year to announce an unprecedented additional £250 million investment programme in new equipment and infrastructure. This will be funded from payroll savings and from the sales of property surplus to requirements and includes the following: about £55 million over three years for the purchase of new aircraft for the Air Corps, with special priority being given to the procurement of new medium lift helicopters. The tender competition for the provision of the helicopters is well advanced and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year; over £20 million for a second new state of the art fishery patrol vessel for the Naval Service to be named the L.E. <i>Niamh. </i>The project is well ahead of schedule and the new ship is due in the naval base, Haulbowline in early May; about £25 million over three years for investment in light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment; and a pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces is also to commence immediately.</P>
    <P>The investment described is additional to £40 million for a new fleet of 40 armoured personnel carriers for the Army. The first of these have been handed over and all of the vehicles will have been delivered by January 2002, almost two years ahead of previous expectations; some £22 million for a state of the art offshore patrol vessel, the L.E. <i>Róisín</i>, which was delivered in 1999; over £10.5 million for new tactical VHF radios; and over £6.5 million on specialist transport cargo vehicles &ndash; deployed to KFOR &ndash; and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4's, and three-quarter tonne trucks. Finally, over £100 million &ndash; this includes £50 million from the proceeds of the sale of property &ndash; is being committed to the development of buildings and other infrastructure at military installations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capabilities announced at the Capabilities Commitment Conference held in Brussels on 20 and 21 November 2000 constitute one element in the development of a European security and defence policy, which has its basis in the aims of the Amsterdam Treaty. They derive from decisions taken by European Heads of State and Government at successive European Council meetings in Cologne, Helsinki and Feira and are firmly rooted in the framework of European common foreign and security policy. These contributions were made in the context of the voluntary headline goal agreed at the European Council at Helsinki.</P>
      <P>In summary, Ireland's contribution of up to 850 members of our Defence Forces does not in any way affect our long-standing policy of military neutrality to which the Government remains firmly committed, nor is any mutual defence arrangement involved.</P>
      <P>A declaration by EU member states was issued after the Capabilities Commitment Conference which clearly stated that the Union's contribution to international security would be made in keeping with UN and OSCE principles. Moreover, it reiterated that these steps did not imply the creation of a European army. Participation by Ireland in any Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision to be taken by the Government. The Government will decide on a case by case basis whether, when and how to commit either troops or other resources.</P>
      <P>In our interventions at the conference, Ireland reiterated these points and specified that in our case, in compliance with the terms of the relevant Irish legislation, we would participate only in missions authorised by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Particular concerns have been expressed concerning implications for our continued involvement in UN peacekeeping and, as raised by Deputy Gormley, regarding the possible role of certain NATO personnel.</P>
      <P>In addition to being entirely consistent with our policy of military neutrality, our commitment to the EU headline goal is fully in keeping with Ireland's approach to overseas peacekeeping and with our foreign policy traditions. We remain absolutely committed to Irish involvement in UN peacekeeping. We will continue to play a full part in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, I stress that the central role of the UN, and particularly that of the UN Security <Col N="887" /> Council in matters of peace and neutrality, is explicitly recognised by the EU. There are clear links between what the EU is trying to achieve and the overhaul of UN peace-keeping operations which is now under way in line with recently adopted Security Council Resolution No. 1327. Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council will facilitate our efforts to help ensure that European security and defence policy and UN reforms proceed in a complementary and mutually reinforcing manner.</P>
    <P>The involvement of NATO stems from the fact that the EU, which is not a military organisation, is likely to remain dependent on NATO infrastructural and transport capacity, as UN-mandated operations such as SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina and KFOR in Kosovo have shown.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions have been taking place between the EU and NATO on the modalities for the use of NATO assets by the EU in carrying out specific Petersberg tasks where the EU does not itself have adequate capabilities. In this context, it is envisaged that the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of NATO &ndash; DSACEUR &ndash; would have a co-ordinating role between the EU and NATO on the allocation of NATO resources for a specific operation. The command arrangements for an EU-led operation would be for the EU to decide and the EU would maintain the political control of any operation using NATO assets and capabilities. Moreover, I would emphasise that Irish involvement in operations where the EU and NATO co-operate will only occur where our peacekeepers act under a UN mandate.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that Ireland's ongoing participation in the development of European security and defence policy is fully consistent with our policy of neutrality and our commitment to international peace and security. We, therefore, approach this task in a positive and constructive spirit.</P>

      <P>Following a tender competition which was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers &ndash; APCs &ndash; initial spares, special tools and training courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the con<Col N="888" /> tract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
    <P>The first two vehicles were produced at the end of 2000 and following rigorous inspection and acceptance testing procedures were officially handed over to me on 11 January 2001. Both vehicles will remain in Switzerland until the end of May 2001 to facilitate training of Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    <P>The full production run will commence in June 2001 and I am delighted to say that all of the vehicles will have been delivered by January 2002 &ndash; almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the progress made on the APC programme. The purchase of the APCs forms an integral part of the ongoing re-equipment programme. The imminent arrival of the vehicles is a great boost for the Defence Forces as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of pilots who have left the Air Corps in the past five years is shown in the following tabular statement. There are two cadet classes in training in the Air Corps &ndash; one class of 12 in the Cadet School, Military College, Defence Forces Training Centre on basic military training and who are due to be commissioned in 2002. The second class of eight are in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, undergoing flight training and are due to be commissioned in October-November this year. Air Corps cadets undergo six months basic military orientation in the Cadet School before reporting to the Air Corps to commence flying training and complete officer training. The duration of the flying training course is approximately 18 months and successful cadets are conferred with &ldquo;wings&rdquo; and commissioned as second lieutenants in the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The flying training course is divided into three phases &ndash; elementary, basic and advanced. The aircraft used on the elementary and basic phases is the Marchetti. Training for the advanced phase is carried out on both the Gazelle helicopter and the Beechcraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cadetship competition for 2001 was recently advertised and 12 of these cadetships will be for Air Corps pilot cadets. A service commitment scheme was introduced in 1997 for pilot officers of the Air Corps with a view to assisting in the retention in service of senior pilots in key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport. From the outset the scheme applied primar<Col N="889" /> ily to experienced personnel who were rated on and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA and Dauphin aircraft which are the principal operational aircraft in the Air Corps. The gratuities available under the scheme were designed to strike a fair and reasonable balance between the demands of the external commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay. Such financial incentives are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining highly qualified and readily marketable personnel. The scheme, moreover, was perceived to offer a more acceptable avenue of approach for all concerned than the imposition of any compulsory retention.</P>
    <P>The service commitment scheme was open to applications from appropriate personnel over a two year trial period from August 1997 to July 1999, inclusive. I am satisfied that, as a significant and innovative incentive scheme, it has helped both to stabilise the loss of key pilots from the Air Corps and to create an environment of some predictable manpower certainty for the medium term future in that regard. A total of 18 pilots had opted to participate under the terms of the service commitment scheme at the end of the original two year period of sanction. Application for entry to the scheme was entirely voluntary in nature.</P>
    <P>In August 2000 the terms of the scheme were made available to a small additional number of pilots who had by then become eligible to participate and voluntary renewal of commitments was also offered to those pilots whose original period of commitment under the scheme had expired. To date two pilots have entered into or renewed service commitments under the scheme.</P>

      <P>During his visit to Russia from 14-16 September 1999 the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the Russian Federation authorities that the Irish security forces would be happy to share their expertise in regard to helping the Russian armed forces in dealing with terrorism. Following this commitment, the Government agreed on 28 September 1999 to official visits to Russia by the Chief of Staff and the Garda Commissioner. As a result of this decision the Chief of Staff visited Moscow from 26-28 June 2000.</P>
      <P>During his visit the Chief of Staff met the Russian armed forces and the issue of urban terrorism was discussed. The Russian armed forces have major problems in dealing with urban terrorism, particularly the matter of car bombs and other explosive devices placed in urban areas. They recognise the Irish Defence Forces expertise in this area and were anxious to avail of training in this country.</P>
      <P>As a result, two explosive ordnance disposal &ndash; EOD &ndash; experts from the Defence Forces travelled to Moscow from 13-17 November 2000 to assess the Russian Federation needs in this field, and, following on from this, members of the Russian armed forces were invited to visit Ireland for appropriate ordnance training. On 5 February 2001, 12 members of the Russian armed forces began a three week course of training in the area of ordnance disposal with the Defence Forces Ordnance Corps. The training is being conducted at the Defence Forces Ordnance School facilities in Dublin and at the Curragh.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The roles of the Defence Forces as assigned by Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence which was published in February 2000. To aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, is among the assigned roles. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required. This entails such duties as assisting the <Col N="891" /> Garda at roadblocks, checkpoints and searches, including in the Border area. The Defence Forces also assist the gardaí in relation to prisoner escorts, cash escorts and explosives escorts.</P>
    <P>No change in this role is envisaged. The question of the level of demand on the Defence Forces in aid of the gardaí is kept under constant review in my Department in consultation with the relevant Departments as well as with the Garda authorities. A portion of the costs arising from the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda Síochána in protecting movements of cash is recouped from the banks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 74 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The Government fully recognises that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I announced on 1 March of last year, the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The first indicator of this investment is the current project for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. The tender competition for the acquisition of the helicopters is progressing well.</P>
      <P>This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tender competition is being carried out in two stages, a request for proposals, RFP, stage and a request for tenders, RFT, stage. Responses to the RFP were received in the Department on 21 September 2000. Six responses were received. The six responses have been evaluated at this <Col N="892" /> stage and a short list of companies for participation in the RFT stage has been drawn up. The documentation for the RFT stage is almost complete and it is expected that it will issue in a matter of days. Following receipt of tenders a comprehensive evaluation process will begin on the proposed helicopters. The evaluation will, of necessity, take some time to complete. It is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>The responses to the RFP carried a range of possible delivery dates for the proposed helicopters. However, the lead in time for the delivery of the helicopters is a matter that will have to be discussed with the successful tenderer in due course. I assure the Deputies that every effort will be made to have the helicopters delivered at the earliest possible dates, while also taking account of the intensive training requirements involved.</P>
    <P>There are other equipment requirements in the Air Corps. A priority is the requirement to acquire fixed wing training aircraft for Air Corps cadets and officers. When proposals are received from the military authorities in relation to this I will arrange for my Department to progress the matter as one of urgency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the military authorities that the necessary equipment and crash rescue vehicle will be available by early April 2001.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps have been tasked to establish a crash rescue service in Finner camp and the necessary personnel have been resourced from the Western Brigade personnel, and will be trained by the Air Corps. They will thereafter be permanently located at Finner camp with the new equipment and the new fire tender.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of these facilities at Finner camp, the Air Corps is currently providing 24 hour search and rescue service, using a Dauphin helicopter from Sligo Airport. It is planned that when the fire and crash rescue service is in place on a 24 hour basis the Dauphin will return to Finner camp. As previously stated, it is anticipated that this will be in place by April 2001.</P>

      <P>In common with other health service providers within the public sector, the Defence Forces medical Corps is encountering difficulty in recruiting and retaining medical personnel. However, my Department, in consultation with the director of the medical corps, is seeking and will continue to seek to recruit additional personnel. In any case where medical officers or dental officers are not available, suitable local arrangements are made with civilian medical and dental practitioners to ensure that the appropriate level of professional care is available to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Two medical officers have been recruited over the past two years. The most recent competition to recruit medical officers was advertised in December, 2000 and arising from this six (6) applications have been received to date. The interview process for these candidates commenced on Monday last, and candidates found suitable will be offered commissions.</P>
      <P>A competition for the appointment of dental officers will be held in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ceiling on pay, which applies to the calculation of benefit under the Redundancy Payments Acts, was first introduced in 1974 by means of the Redundancy Payments (Weekly Payments and Lump Sum) Order, 1974 (S.I. No. 82 of 1974). This set the ceiling at £2,500 per annum. The Redundancy Payments Act, 1979, raised this ceiling to £5,000 per annum and provided for its variation by regulation. When so doing, account had to be taken of average earnings in the transportable goods industries as recorded by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the ceiling and the average earnings of this class of worker was established because, historically, this group have been the highest paid on average in industry. However, while the statutes do not impose a legal obligation on me to change the benefit ceiling, there is clearly an expectation that the ceiling would be raised in relation to average earnings. The benefit ceiling was last raised in May 1994 from £13,000 per annum, that is, £250 per week, to its current level of £15,600 per annum, £300 per week.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the drafting of regulations to raise the ceiling to £20,800 per annum, that is, £400 per week, is at an advanced stage in my Department.</P>

      <P>The framework for the Social Economy Programme, which was agreed by the Social Economy Monitoring Committee, sets out the objectives of the programme, eligibility criteria, the links between the national and local structures of the programme and formalises and defines the working relationships, roles and responsibilities of the different actors at local level.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the eligibility criteria, including a provision that allows for up to 10% of the total number of grant-aided persons to be exempt from the normal eligibility criteria, are set out in annex 2 of the framework document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The over 35 years age limit for participation by long-term unemployed arose from the recommendation of the Partnership 2000 Group Report on the Social Economy, to allow for a phased <Col N="896" /> reduction of the numbers on the community employment programme and to transfer funding from it into the social economy programme.</P>
    <P>The over 35 years age limit does not apply in the case of Travellers and disabled persons who meet the criteria set out in annex 2 of the framework document. The programme was launched in September 2000 and is now in its first full year of operation. It is not intended that the eligibility criteria for grant-aiding employees of the programme be amended at this stage. The national monitoring committee will monitor progress made by the programme including the take up by eligible participants on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>In the situation of increased and sustained funding which I have advocated since assuming my present responsibilities, the role of NGOs is being strengthened. This is manifested by increased levels of funding. The provisional out-turn for the aid programme in 2000 is approximately £210 million, of which £138 million is under the direct control of Ireland Aid through the Department of Foreign Affairs. NGOs received approximately £19 million directly from the Department. In addition, we estimate that approximately £8.35 million was dispersed to NGOs <i>via</i> APSO and NCDE. Both organisations are directly funded by Ireland Aid. Therefore, a total of £27.35 million was allocated to NGOs which represents almost 20% of the funds under direct Ireland Aid control for expenditure purposes. A number of Irish NGOs also receive funds from multilateral agencies, such as the UN and the EU to which the Irish Government contributes from its development co-operation budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Official development assistance, ODA, in 2001 will reach a record level of £261 million, of which <Col N="897" /> £189 million will be under the direct control of Ireland Aid through the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is my intention to outline in the Ireland Aid annual report the amounts disbursed to the largest NGOs. The Government's programme of development co-operation recognises the excellent work which NGOs undertake in development efforts throughout the developing world. This programme has built strong and solid relationships with all of our NGO partners and missionary orders over the years. To further strengthen this relationship my Department is currently examining the provision of multi-annual programme budgeting for those NGOs who have the capacity to programme in this way. This process will give increased focus to qualitative outcomes, impact and rigorous evaluation in order that we can share lessons learned and continuously adopt a best practice approach.</P>

The society receives an annual grant-in-aid from my Department amounting to £509,000 for 2001. The grant-in-aid is in respect of staff salaries and related costs and for refugee support services.</P>
      <P>The annual audited accounts of the society are available for inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General and any queries raised are answered by the society.

      <P>The issues mentioned were covered comprehensively in the report of the steering group on the Review of the Irish Naval Service and the Air Corps which was prepared by Price Waterhouse Consultants and in the White Paper on Defence which was published in February, 2000.</P>

In the meantime, other elements of the plan are being developed.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that I have announced a special additional £250 million investment programme for the Defence Forces, including about £55m. over three years for the purchase of new aircraft for the Air Corps, with special priority being given to the procurement of new medium lift helicopters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> Since the White Paper was published, I have announced an unprecedented additional £250 million investment programme in new equipment and infrastructure. This will be funded from payroll savings and from the sale of properties surplus to requirements. About £55 million will be spent over three years on the purchase of new aircraft for the Air Corps with special priority being given to the procurement of new medium lift helicopters. The tender competition for the provision of the helicopters is well advanced and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the middle of this year. More than £20 million will be spent on a second new state of the art fishery patrol vessel for the Naval Service, to be named the <i>L.E. Niamh. </i>The project is well ahead of schedule and the new ship is due in the Naval Base, Haulbowline in early May. About £25 million over three years will be invested in light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces is also to commence immediately.</P>
    <P>The investment described is additional to: £40 million for a new fleet of 40 armoured personnel carriers for the Army &ndash; the first of these have been handed over and all the vehicles will have been delivered by January 2002, almost two years ahead of previous expectations; £22 million for a state of the art offshore patrol vessel, the <i>L.E. Róisín, </i>which was delivered in 1999; over £10.5 million for new tactical VHF radios; over £6.5 million on specialist transport cargo vehicles, deployed to KFOR, and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4's, and ¾ ton trucks.</P>
    <P>Finally, over £100 million, including £50 million from the proceeds of the sale of property, is being committed to the development of buildings and other infrastructure at military installations.</P>

It was also necessary to present the programme to the special North South EU programmes body for its endorsement, as regards cross-Border aspects, in tandem with the Northern Ireland Leader+ operational programme.</P>
      <P>The Commission has a period of five months to examine the draft programme and to seek further information and clarifications. In that regard, my Department is in negotiation with the Commission on the content of the programme with the aim of securing the Commission's approval at the earliest time to clear the way for commencement of Leader activity in rural areas for the period to 2006.</P>
      <P>In addition, the national rural development programme, devised under the national development plan and which will fund mainstream Leader activity, requires final approval from the Commission. This will coincide with the issue of approval for the Leader+ programme. In parallel, my Department is progressing the process of selection of rural development groups to deliver the programmes. The formal appointment of groups and allocation of funding will be decided by Government following receipt of the Commission's approval of the enabling expenditure.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, pending the coming on stream of the programmes, my Department continues to provide interim funding to existing Leader II groups, without prejudice, to help maintain core resources so that groups appointed can immediately commence programme delivery and support of projects in their rural areas. To date, some £3.2 million has been allocated under the interim funding arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU regulations governing the special beef premium and suckler cow schemes, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies, based on <Col N="904" /> the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application.</P>
      <P>Each producer's reckonable livestock units are obtained in respect of each calendar year as follows: male cattle up to and including 24 months old on which the producer applies for special beef premium and bull premium &ndash; 0.6 livestock unit each; male cattle over 24 months old on which the producer applies for special beef premium &ndash; one livestock unit each; ewes on which the producer applies for ewe premium &ndash; 0.15 livestock unit each; suckler cows &ndash; one livestock unit each; 'notional' dairy cows &ndash; one livestock unit each.</P>
      <P>Notional dairy cows are obtained by dividing a producer's milk quota in respect of a given calendar year by the national average yield per cow for that year, or by the recorded average milk yield per cow where the producer is in an official milk recording scheme.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the stocking density entitlement of the person named is fully utilised by his milk quota. The person named had a declared forage area of 13.60 hectares giving him a maximum entitlement of 27.20 reckonable livestock units. The milk quota of the person named of 31,497 gallons divided by the national average yield per cow for 2000 of 876 gallons utilises 35.95 livestock units and thus his full entitlement. The person named would not, therefore, have been entitled to special beef premium or suckler cow premium payments in respect of the calendar year 2000.</P>

    <P>Payment of the first and second advance of the 2000 ewe premium scheme was made to the person named on 26 June 2000 and 23 October 2000, respectively. The regulation governing payment of the final instalment was published yesterday, 13 February, and I expect that payment of the <Col N="905" /> final instalment will commence early next week. Under the 2000 sheep headage scheme the person named applied on 50 hoggets. To enable the application to be processed he was asked on 28 April 2000 to complete a form EP250 giving details of any losses incurred during the two months retention period. The person named returned the form EP250 with a note stating that he only had 46 hoggets on the date of application. Consequently, he was found to be in breach of the terms and conditions of the scheme and his application was rejected in full.</P>
    <P>The person named has been notified of this decision in writing and has been advised that he can have this decision reviewed if he so wishes.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU regulations, 1999 extensification premium is payable on all animals paid under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme and under the 1999 special beef premium scheme if the stocking density on the holding is less than 1.40 livestock units per hectare.</P>
      <P>The stocking density of the holding of the person named was found to be 1.40 livestock units per hectare based on 57.10 livestock units and the declared forage area under his 1999 area aid application of 40.59 hectares. As this is not less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare he is not entitled to payment of 1999 extensification premium.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid his full entitlement of £4,421.70 under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme based on his suckler cow quota of 30 suckler cows. The first advance of £2,653.02, representing 60% of his entitlement, was paid to him on 14 December 2000; the second advance of £884.34, representing a further 20% of his entitlement, was paid to him on 19 December 2000, with the balance of £884.34 paid to him on 31 January, 2001.</P>
      <P>At an inspection carried out on his herd on 26 September 2000 two animals applied on under the 2000 cattle headage scheme were rejected. The person named was advised of this on the day of inspection and subsequently notified of the position by letter of 21 November 2000. He was advised that no payment would issue for these two animals and that payment on the remaining eligible animals would be subject to a penalty. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed but he confirmed that he accepted the position on 27 November 2000. Consequently, the amount payable of £3,108 was subject to a 4.44% reduction penalty and payment of £2,970.00 has issued to him today under the 2000 cattle headage scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid his full entitlement of £140.00 under the 2000 sheep headage scheme on 8 September 2000 and £28.00 under the 2000 sheep headage top-up on 20 December 2000.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Donegal is not allowed to have his sheep quota accepted for the ewe premium for 2001 as he resides in the destocked mountain area; if this decision is a virtual ban on all new entrants to sheep production in those areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person named applied to my Department for a herd number in December last. He also sought to lease in 20 ewe premium quota rights but, as he does not hold a herd number, that lease could not be processed. He has submitted an application under the 2001 ewe premium scheme and that application, together with his application for a herd number, are now being examined. If his holding is found to include any commonage land the proposed lease will not be processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commonage framework plans are being completed in respect of all commonage land in the six western counties. Pending the completion of those plans, my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put an interim commonage framework plan in place. The interim plan, which has been agreed with the EU Commission, provides for destocking of up to 30% of commonage land in the six western counties &ndash; Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Leitrim, Galway, Kerry &ndash; and no increase in stocking <Col N="907" /> intensity is permitted where destocking is required.</P>
    <P>The main aim of these plans will be to set sustainable stocking levels, which will allow for the regeneration of damaged vegetation. The preparation of detailed commonage framework plans for every commonage is at an advanced stage, and when these plans are implemented stocking rates will be set which will reflect the environmental needs of each commonage.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the person named may not, if his holding includes commonage land, acquire ewe quota rights.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 400 of 7 November 2000, his attention has been drawn to the continued backlog in this system and the fact that a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny has still not been given an appointment; his views on the current status of the review of the 1994 regulations; if immediate steps can be taken to expand the scheme; and the failure rate in relation to the scheme.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As previously stated, my Department has no involvement in the operation of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal. The Revenue Commissioners have no such involvement either. However, I am informed that the backlog of appeals, referred to in my reply to Dáil Question No. 400 of 7 November 2000, has persisted and that there were 284 persons on the waiting list at the end of last year. I further understand that the appeals process was disrupted last year by the transfer of the appeals board to Dún Laoghaire. As I pointed out in my previous reply, the position is exacerbated by the fact that many of those who appeal to the board are aware that they do not meet the qualifying criteria specified in the regulations but still insist on exercising their right of appeal.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the members of the appeal board are engaged in this work on a part-time basis only. However, I understand that some additional sittings of the board are now being planned to deal with the backlog and the person referred to by the Deputy should be offered an appointment for the hearing of his appeal next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the scheme by an interdepartmental committee under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is ongoing. It would be imprudent <Col N="914" /> of me to consider any amendments to the scheme until such time as the review is completed and its content is given due consideration. While I am not in a position to confirm the rate of refusal of the requisite primary medical certificate at health board level, I understand that the failure rate in relation to appeals to the Medical Board of Appeal is 80%.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons for his recent decision to abolish the ceiling on employer's PRSI; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the extra cost that this will add to firms employing large numbers of people; the plans he has to redress the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4136/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my budget speech in announcing the PRSI changes, I have favoured, for some time, simplifying the whole area of PRSI and levies which over the years has become quite complex and cumbersome from an operational perspective. The various PRSI measures introduced represent the first steps in the reform process. Moreover, I have already signalled my intention to continue with the rationalisation process in my next budget and the various views which have been expressed in the matter will be borne in mind at that stage.</P>
      <P>I believe that the abolition of the employer's contribution ceiling needs to be viewed in the wider context of the improved general business climate in recent years. I appreciate that not all businesses have benefited from the significant corporation tax reductions achieved to date but, nevertheless, very many have. In addition, the substantial improvement that I announced in the budget in the capital allowances for plant and machinery will benefit a wide range of enterprises. Overall, therefore, the environment for business continues to be very positive.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to point out that, notwithstanding the budgetary measure, the PRSI rate for employers in Ireland compares very favourably with the EU norm.</P>

    <P>* Provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>The projected fall in the General Government Debt to GDP ratio in the years 2001 to 2003 is due both to projected increases in GDP and projected falls in the actual level of debt, as budgetary surpluses in each year are applied to debt reduction.</P>
    <P>My Department's projections do not extend beyond the three-year multi-annual budgetary time frame. However, the Government's policy is to continue to run budgetary surpluses beyond 2001 as long as economic and social circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services at Monaghan General Hospital rests with the North Eastern Health Board, which has statutory responsibility for the provision of health services in its functional area.</P>
      <P>The board is committed to developing its acute hospital services in line with the needs and requirements of its resident population. In 1998, the board adopted a policy framework for the development of its acute hospitals entitled &ldquo;North East Hospitals &ndash; The Next Five Years &ndash; A Framework for Continuing Development&rdquo;. This emphasised the need for high quality, safe and accessible acute hospital services, utilising all five hospital sites within the board's area. It confirmed the board's commitment to developing each hospital site within the two hospital groups, Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and the Louth-Meath hospital group. The Cavan-Monaghan hospital group has been a major beneficiary of this policy.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that vacancies in respect of consultant medical staff for Cavan-Monaghan have been processed by the board in the usual way following resignation or retirement. It has not, until recently, submitted an application for the post of a second obstetrician for Monaghan General Hospital. On 6 February last, my Department received a proposal from the board seeking immediate approval to the appointment of additional temporary consultant medical staff, to the Louth-Meath and Cavan-Monaghan hospital groups. One of these temporary consultant posts is a consultant obstetrician/ gynaecologist to be based at Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The question of additional consultant medical posts is a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal, the statutory body set up to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the health Acts. My Department has confirmed that in the particular circumstances, it has no objection to the submission by the North Eastern Health Board of these proposals to An Comhairle for its consideration.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental treatment services to eligible persons in County Kerry is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level <Col N="924" /> of dental care. Children in certain classes, usually in second, fourth and sixth classes, are dentally screened and follow up treatment is provided as necessary. Children who have attended national school retain eligibility up to their 16th birthday and treatment is provided within the resources available to the boards through an extension of the targeted approach. As the delivery of services to children is not demand led, patient waiting lists do not arise.</P>
    <P>There are currently six vacancies for permanent dental surgeons in the Kerry area which both the health board and the Local Appointments Commission have been unable to fill either on a temporary or a permanent basis. This position has resulted in a severe curtailment of routine dental services in the county. Children presenting with pain, injury or sepsis are awarded treatment on a priority basis.</P>

Domestic rates were abolished in 1978. As regards services charges, domestic refuse charges account for £18.8 million of the £505.3 million amount and domestic water charges account for approximately £2 million. As domestic water charges were abolished with effect from 1 January 1997 this amount represents arrears of charges due.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the question relates to the strengthened provisions for the protection of the built heritage introduced under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, now consolidated in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Under these provisions, which became law on 1 January 2000, there is now a mandatory requirement on each planning authority to identify as protected structures all buildings which are considered to be of special interest from an architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical point of view. All such structures must be included in the record of protected structures which forms part of the development plan. Each owner and occupier of a protected structure is legally obliged to ensure that the structure is preserved.</P>

    <P>The procedures for the identification of protected structures ensure that owners and occupiers are given an opportunity to comment on any proposal by a planning authority to include a structure in the record of protected structures. Any comments made must be taken into account before the authority's elected members decide <Col N="928" /> whether or not the structure should become a protected structure.</P>
    <P>In May 1999, I introduced a scheme of grants to assist owners and occupiers of protected structures in undertaking necessary conservation works. The standard amount of grant is 50% of the approved cost of works, up to a maximum of £10,000. In exceptional circumstances, and subject to the approval of my Department, the maximum grant may be increased to £20,000.</P>

      <P>The tender documents for the award of the contract for the provision of car testing facilities required each test centre to be located within 30 miles of 90% of the car owners that it would serve and also required testing to be carried out on a self-financing basis at no cost to the Exchequer. The contract was awarded to National Car Testing Service Limited on that basis and I am satisfied the 43 test centres operated by the company meet the specified travelling distance requirement. The test fees are set by reference to costs incurred by the company in meeting the required service levels. Consequently the <Col N="929" /> provision of additional test centres would result in additional costs to the company and these could result in increases in the test fees to motorists in general.</P>
      <P>Following representations to me, the company was asked to investigate the possibility of providing additional facilities to serve car owners in Inishowen. Because of the difficulties in identifying suitable available locations for a test centre and conscious of the additional costs, the company approached Donegal County Council about the availability of a suitable site. I understand that discussions are continuing between the local authority and the company on the subject.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the most effective route out of poverty is through paid employment. The earnings disregard is a major feature of the one parent family payment &ndash; OFP &ndash; and is designed to recognise the additional costs which a lone parent may face in moving into employment and to ensure that the financial implications of making such a move are straightforward and easily understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the means test associated with the OFP, a recipient is allowed to earn up to £115.38 with<Col N="930" /> out affecting his/her payment. Earnings between £115.38 per week and £230.76 per week are assessed at 50% and the rate of OFP paid is reduced accordingly. Payment ceases when earnings exceed £230.76 per week. However, there are transitional arrangements in place whereby an OFP recipient who exceeds the upper earnings limit may retain 50% of his/her payment for a further 12 months. The number of lone parents at work has increased in recent years. The review of the one parent family payment, published in September 2000, found that about 60% of recipients have some level of earnings. Of these, approximately 75% have earnings below the £115.38 per week threshold.</P>
    <P>The level of the earnings disregard has not been increased since the introduction of the OFP scheme in 1997. However, research undertaken for the review suggests that at present the income disregards are adequate to support the level and nature of the employment in which OFP recipients are engaged. Accordingly, no increase was recommended at this time. However, the situation will be monitored and reviewed as appropriate.</P>

    <P>My Department provides two centres for the detention of women. The Dóchas centre at Mountjoy Prison which I opened in September 1999 has the capacity to house 70 offenders and Limerick Prison has a 12 place unit. Planning for a new, purpose designed facility for females to replace the existing facilities at Limerick Prison is at an advanced stage. This project will increase <Col N="932" /> the capacity to 24 places. Also, under the provisions of the Children Bill, 1999, separate, dedicated secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old offenders. In this regard the prison building programme includes provision for a 100 place unit with full support facilities in the Dublin region comprising separate secure detention for up to 20 females in the 16-17 year age group.</P>
    <P>The information sought in relation to the average length of time that women serve in prison is not available. At present the compilation and analysis of such statistics must be done manually pending the introduction of a new information technology programme for the Prison Service. This programme is well advanced and is in the process of being deployed throughout the prison service. This will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners and enable the automation of many existing functions. Information will be more easily accessible once this new system is in operation.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the number of female offenders in prison custody has been steadily growing. I am satisfied that there will be appropriate facilities in place for their detention on the completion of this Government's prison building programme.</P>

      <P>One of the prime objectives of the Prison Service is to develop and put in place an enhanced range of rehabilitative measures which will be made available to all prisoners. The Prison Service already provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes, many of which are available to the general body of prisoners. These have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release.</P>
      <P>The psychological service is currently made up of one head of service and nine clinical psychologists. The service's work includes the provision of long-term therapy, supportive counselling, motivational counselling, and a crisis intervention service. The Service are also involved in the development of programmes which target those characteristics of offenders which are known to be associated with recidivism. These programmes include, the sex offender treatment programme and the thinking skills course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sex offender treatment programme is available in Arbour Hill Prison and the Curragh <Col N="933" /> Place of Detention. This programme is delivered by officers of the probation and welfare and the psychological services. The Arbour Hill programme can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to eleven months to complete. A second programme was recently introduced in the Curragh Place of Detention. The emphasis is on accepting personal responsibility for the offence and developing effective relapse prevention strategies for each offender.</P>
    <P>The thinking skills course referred to above was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork prison early in 1998 and more recently to the Curragh Place of Detention. It is designed to target a range of offenders including sex offenders, particularly with a view to motivating the latter group to engage in the most intensive programmes. The course is run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of the psychological service.</P>
    <P>A psychology service is currently available in Mountjoy Prison, St. Patrick's Institution, Cork and Limerick Prisons, Shanganagh Castle, Wheatfield Place of Detention, Arbour Hill, Fort Mitchel, the Training Unit and the Curragh Place of Detention. The prisons not presently covered are Portlaoise Prison, Castlerea Prison, Cloverhill Prison, the Midlands Prison, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey. However, a Governor can request the services of the psychological service should the need arise in any of the institutions not currently serviced.</P>
    <P>In December 1998 I approved the establishment of an expert group to review and report on the future role, needs, structure and organisation of the psychology service of my Department. The report of this group was published in August, 1999. Since then the number of psychologists employed by the prison service has increased to 10. In addition, the recruitment of further psychologists for the prison service is under way.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made by my Department to address the question of vacancies in the probation and welfare service. The Civil Service Commission recently held a recruitment campaign to fill both existing vacancies and newly sanctioned posts. Offers of appointment are currently in the process of being made to successful candidates. In addition my Department have recently advertised for the recruitment of 25 additional full-time temporary positions of probation and welfare officer. Assignments to fill vacancies in the service will be made as candidates from both these competitions take up duty in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that recruitment will continue until all vacancies and the new posts in the service have been filled. My Department is also working to heighten the profile of the probation and welfare service as a career option for social work graduates and in this regard availed of the Opportunities 2001 Recruitment Fair at the RDS from 3 to 6 February, 2001 to promote the service to graduates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> The psychiatric service is provided to the prisons and places of detention by visiting psychiatrists. My officials in the Department and in the prisons service are working with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to improve the organisation and level of psychiatric input in prisons in the Dublin area. It is envisaged that the improvements in psychiatric care being developed through this dialogue will be extended, where feasible, to prisons within other health board areas.</P>
    <P>I have established a group to review the structure and organisation of prisons health care services including psychiatric services. I expect to have a report from the group by mid-2001. It is my intention that this report will be published as soon as possible. Any recommendations made by this group in relation to improving prison health care services will be treated as a matter of priority by me.</P>

    <P>Mountjoy Prison, Portlaoise Prison, Limerick Prison and Shelton Abbey are currently operating below capacity to allow for planned refurbishment as part of the prison building programme. Shanganagh Castle, as an open prison for young offenders, has a rigorous admissions policy which can result in low prisoner numbers being held there from time to time.</P>
    <P>In addition Portlaoise Prison operates below capacity for security reasons and because part of the accommodation there is sub-standard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> The Midlands Prison is a brand new institution and it's population is being increased on a phased basis for sound operational reasons. As the Midlands Prison expands its inmate population, further decreases will take place at Mountjoy Prison to facilitate the major refurbishment programme at that location.</P>

      <P>The form that proceedings take under the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, for a safety, protection or barring order is determined by rules that are made by the relevant Court Rules Committee with the concurrence of the Minister. For the most part those orders are directed towards the place where the applicant normally resides and it would be a necessary part of the order that that place is identified in the order. I doubt the feasibility of using a post office box number rather than the place of residence of <Col N="937" /> the applicant as the means of ensuring the full protection of the person. However, my Department continues to keep this area of the law under review in consultation with relevant interests.

Additionally, the rate at which projects move through the design stages varies very significantly depending on both the size and relative complexity of the projects.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that both the ASTI and Government teams were able to reach agreement on a way forward. The progress now agreed can contribute greatly to improved industrial relations between the parties. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on the broader issues while the Labour Court process is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully committed to ensuring that the certificate examinations will proceed without any diminution in either their integrity or validity. In general terms, this has always been, and will continue to be, the approach where there is any threat to the national examinations. Resolution of any dispute must remain the top priority. However, preparation of alternative arrange<Col N="941" /> ments is always prudent in the interests of students.</P>
    <P>The position on time lost because of the dispute and the holding of mock examinations is that I am prepared to explore with the school representative bodies how the time available for tuition can be maximised for all examination candidates over the balance of the school year. I would encourage students to remain at school for tuition to the very end of the final term and thereby get the benefit of all available class time rather than engage in the usual practice of absenting themselves from school during the final days of term.</P>
    <P>The question of when parent-teacher meetings are held is a matter for each school. While schools are entitled to conduct these activities within the 167 days I would encourage schools to hold the meetings at times convenient to parents. The structure of the parent teacher meetings is, similarly, a matter for each school. My Department actively encourages parental involvement in the education of their children and will continue to do so. As the recognised primary educators of the child, parents have a right to be assured that the child's needs are being met by the school. Parents should be given as much information as possible on all aspects of the child's progress and development.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken or encouraged by my Department to enhance the role of parents in their children's education. These include: the setting up of the National Parents' Council, Post-Primary, to facilitate participation by parents in consultations with the Government about the development of educational policies; the payment of an annual grant towards the expenses of the council; representation of parents on the boards of management of schools and on vocational education committees; close consultation with parents in the development of each school's behaviour and discipline policies; parents are entitled to receive copies of any reports on the operation and performance of the school produced by the board of management, and will have the same access to school accounts as my Department; parents have a right of access to their children's records; parents have a right of involvement in the preparation of the school plan, copies of which will also be circulated to them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> I am aware of the demand by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding, including for the reasons referred to by the Deputy. The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflect the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its very nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.</P>
    <P>In the case of secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of per capita grants may be used for this purpose. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, insurance cover is arranged by the relevant vocational education committee. With regard to community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    <P>In this connection I have already shown my commitment through the establishment of the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. In addition, the standard per capita grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional per capita grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date.</P>

It was not possible to arrange an assessment for the child before now because NEPS had not been in a position to provide a psychological service to his school. I have asked NEPS to have the psychologist assigned to this school investigate the needs of the child named by the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>My Department understands from inquiries to Carlow Institute of Technology that the student in question is at present pursuing a national certificate course and had previously completed the first year of a degree course.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the third level maintenance grants for trainees (TLT) scheme a grant-holder may in general receive funding for one third level training aided course. However, subject to a maximum duration of four years in all, funding may be extended where a grant-holder who, having passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course, wishes to transfer to a different course. Such a grant-holder is eligible for a grant in respect of the normal duration of attendance on the new course. Accordingly, the student to whom the Deputy refers may submit a grant application for consideration under the terms of the TLT Scheme, to Kildare Vocational Educational Committee, the relevant body charged with the administration of the scheme in this case. It will be a matter for the VEC to determine the student's eligibility having regard to the other conditions of the scheme including, in particular, means.</P>

      <P>My Department initiated a psychological service to primary schools in the greater Tralee area in 1998 but it unfortunately had to be discontinued due to the resignation of the psychologist concerned. It has proved difficult to find a replacement.</P>
      <P>However, the national educational psychological service (NEPS), an agency of my Department, has been actively recruiting additional psychologists. As an interim measure, one of the newly appointed psychologists, who is based in Cork, has started to work part-time in Tralee and will deal with urgent cases from primary schools in the area. Posts are still being filled from the most recent competition for NEPS, and one of the new appointees will be assigned to County Kerry.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's programme, a further competition for recruitment to NEPS will be organised by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners later this year. It is intended that there will be seven NEPS psychologists working in County Kerry by the end of the year 2003.</P>
