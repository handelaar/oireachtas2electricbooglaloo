    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to a request by ICTU to consider issues arising from inflationary pressures in the economy, a process of discussion was commenced on 17 October and was brought to a successful conclusion with an agreement on 4 December last, the text of which has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library. In summary, it provides for a 2% increase in basic pay with effect from 1 April <Col N="3" /> 2001 and a lump sum equal to 1% of basic pay to be implemented on 1 April 2002.</P>
    <P>These provisions are subject to a number of conditions, principally on the following lines: a commitment to full and ongoing co-operation with change and flexibility, a commitment to increasing productivity and employment, and an undertaking that the special increases will not be pursued through industrial action of any type.</P>
    <P>A national implementation body representing Government, IBEC-CIF and ICTU will meet quarterly to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of the PPF. The first meeting of the body took place yesterday, 29 January. Participation in the implementation body is based on those social partner organisations which concluded the 4 December agreement under the PPF, namely, the Government, IBEC-CIF and ICTU.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, clause 7 of the PPF provides a mechanism to recognise difficulties which employers may have in meeting the pay terms of the PPF. The 4 December agreement confirms this by ensuring that particular regard must be had for a number of circumstances where competitiveness and employment are at risk, including employments in vulnerable sectors, employments where wage costs, within the terms of the PPF, have increased significantly, employments which are experiencing economic and commercial difficulties and-or those which may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, and employments where pay costs have increased significantly above those implied by the terms of the PPF.</P>
    <P>On public service pay, the benchmarking body is due to report by 30 June 2002. Following receipt of the report, discussions about implementation will commence immediately between public service employers and the public services committee of ICTU. One quarter of any increase arising from the report will be implemented with effect from 1 December 2001 and the balance will be implemented on an agreed phased basis.</P>
    <P>As I already indicated, the 4 December agreement is underpinned by a new understanding on industrial relations peace and its provisions should be viewed alongside the income related measures set out in the budget for 2001. The totality of measures involved will not only inject new stability into the partnership process but will also create the appropriate context for achieving the highly ambitious objectives in the non-pay areas of the PPF, especially with regard to tackling social disadvantage and capacity constraints.</P>
    <P>Regarding PPF plenary meetings, the most recent meeting took place on Thursday last and the next meeting is scheduled for 26 April. Last Thursday's meeting focused on the themes of overall implementation of the PPF on which very significant progress has been made, as is evident from the latest progress report available in the Oireachtas Library; the macroeconomic outlook for this year, with particular regard to the post-<Col N="4" /> budget context; and delivery of the infrastructural aspects of the national development plan on which good progress has been made.</P>
    <P>Regarding my attendance at the AGM of the Irish Farmers' Association on 16 January, I placed particular emphasis in my address, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, on the measures being taken to restore consumer confidence in beef, arising from the BSE crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the comments of the European Commission as to the likely inflationary effects of the Government's budgetary policy were motivated by jealousy and that in response we should put on the green jersey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated outside the House, the Government always pays attention to the comments of international bodies or a distinguished person such as Pedro Solbes. In this case, while the Government does not share his views, it will listen to what he has to say. We have not yet received the full text of what he wishes to put to the ECOFIN Council, but I am aware of what he said from the preliminary report of his comments. I do not agree with him, but I have no doubt that his views will be debated at some length at the ECOFIN Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be difficult, but the Taoiseach has not answered the question. Does he believe, as Government spokespeople are briefing, that the European Commission's views were motivated by jealousy and agree that we should put on the green jersey to resist the Commission's views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not use either of those terms. What I have said is that 99.4 is not a suitable provision to use. I understand that it is the view of Pedro Solbes that the budgetary measures in the Irish economy have been &ndash; to use his own words, which he has used many times &ndash; excessively successful and that it might be good to lower the heat. This will happen in any event. It is projected that this year we will move from a figure of more than 10% to somewhere in the region of 7%. He also stated that we should cut our capital programme, but I do not share that view. This does not add up in an economy which has the highest surplus in the European Union, in which large resources are being placed in a fund to be used in 25 years and which has the second lowest debt in the European Union after Luxembourg which, effectively, has no debt. At the same time he ignores the fact that there are capacity constraints in areas such as electricity, gas, infrastructure and water management. It is his contention that we should cut public expenditure, but on his own assessment public expenditure here is still among the lowest in the European Union. I have no wish to become involved in a row, but if he was to follow his own logic, he should tell some of the other countries in which public expenditure <Col N="5" /> is far higher, which have far lower surpluses and in which provision has not been made for pensions in the long-term, to get their act together. He is not doing that.</P>
      <P>With regard to inflation, Deputy Bruton shares my view that price stability is extremely important. We must continue to contend and deal with price stability and take it seriously as a policy issue. However, that was not the basis of his concern. I assure Deputy Bruton that we will continue this year to work on the issue of price stability, which is fundamental to economic and fiscal policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach has disavowed the language used by both the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste in their responses. I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has used a more measured and carefully argued view in response to the Commission. His disavowal of what the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance said is significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach respond to the comments made by representatives of the voluntary and community pillar on the budget and its outcome? They felt abused and betrayed by its provisions. Did the meeting to which the Taoiseach refers discuss the threat from the community and voluntary pillar to withdraw its participation in the structure of social partnership because of that sense of betrayal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The community and voluntary pillar representatives, whom I have met and am due to meet again, are concerned about the element of the programme to introduce progressively social inclusion measures with a total cost of £1.5 billion by 2003, to progress over the period towards a target of £100 per week in respect of the lowest rates of child welfare payments and to increase child benefits substantially towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. Their stated position is that more work should have been done on that. They acknowledge the successes but believe that not enough was done on those aspects.</P>
      <P>The social welfare package in the budget was a record £850 million, two thirds of the target. The basic rates were increased by 10% while families with children received increases of up to 18%. The decision to address child care costs through the child benefit system provides a non-discriminatory support which has greatest relative benefit for poorest families. The social and voluntary pillar, I understand, wishes to have further dialogue not only within the PPF committee meetings but also directly with the Government. There is to be a meeting with me and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure all aspects are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While they acknowledge £850 million was an enormous figure to spend in one go, they are concerned that some aspects should have received more attention. It is not possible to do everything <Col N="6" /> in one budget but I will listen to their views and explain our thinking and logic in the first of the three budgets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the charge made by some representatives of different organisations within that pillar that the effect of the budget, notwithstanding the enormous amounts of money which were allocated and were available in an unprecedented way to the Administration, is to widen the gap between rich and poor and to make inequality in society greater? Is that a fair charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that charge and it was not made to me in those terms. I note from the Deputy's phrasing that he is not making it. The leadership of that pillar feels that the target of £100 per week in respect of the lowest rates of social welfare payments should get a higher regard than some other aspects. They would not argue necessarily about the money. They argued previously, for example, that they did not think the last budget was the one for the elderly and said as much. They argued that the elderly had done extremely well in the previous few years.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into the argument about whether the elderly or other categories are more in need of the resources. They have a point about the rates for people who reach £100; that is the one on which they focused and which we must discuss. The programme is a three year one and the above point is the one which was highlighted. We must work together under this programme and try to share the resources as fairly as possible. I would not contend that older people will not find work as easily as others or that they will be unable to find alternative means of earning income. I am aware that some people in this category cannot find such means but many others can and, indeed, have in recent years. That is why the number of long-term unemployed has reduced from 5.6% to 1.2%. There is a category of people whose members cannot find work and who, for one reason or another, are unlikely to do so even in good times. It was requested that particular focus be given to this issue and we will try to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the representations made by various groups within the social partnership structure, including IBEC and others, why has the Government chosen to reduce the top rate of income tax, which affects only one-third of working people, at a time when they could have significantly increased payments in real and percentage terms to people who depend on the State for their incomes? These people are now poorer in absolute terms than they were heretofore because the gap between rich and poor has been manifestly widened by this divisive budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more than one category in Irish society and resources were spread <Col N="7" /> fairly and equally in the recent budget and in previous ones. The increases being provided by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to the less well off in Irish society cannot in any sense be described as either divisive or unhelpful. They go a considerable way towards easing the difficulties and problems experienced by people dependent on the State. That is not to detract from the fact that those who represent this category of people believe the balance should be slightly different. If we had done things the other way around, I have no doubt the representatives of other groups in society, particularly the elderly, would have expressed a different view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC the forecasts issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which were obtained by <i>The Irish Times</i> under the Freedom of Information Act, to the effect that some 336,000 additional immigrants will be required by 2006 if our economy is to continue to grow? The forecast states that if this trend continues, as many as one in eight people living in the Republic in 2010 will be an immigrant. Did the Taoiseach discuss this matter with ICTU and IBEC and did either party raise the need for a Minister to co-ordinate immigrant affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss that issue with either ICTU or IBEC, although I have seen a summary of the report. Deputy Mitchell will have noted that the report stated that 60% of the people classified as returning to this country are Irish. The forecast was based on last year's figures. Figures have increased and decreased over the past ten years and I do not believe we should switch our entire policy based on figures produced in a year in which the economy grew by 10%. If an average figure had been taken, it might have offered a more realistic picture but I do not believe the figures outlined in the forecast represent a correct assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Taoiseach mean by &ldquo;switch our entire policy&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that we should not start to make changes to our immigration policy which would result in 336,000 people coming into the country over a five year period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach will agree that given the forecast with which he has concurred, the immigrant population will reach 1:8, if it has not already done so. Will he agree, therefore, that we should be co-ordinating health, housing, social welfare and education issues across Departments to ensure racism and xenophobia does not take root? Has the Taoiseach considered or discussed with ICTU or IBEC the need for a Minister to co-ordinate these issues because of the forecasted growth in immigrants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The social partners have not been involved in this and perhaps it is not for me to answer questions for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, I wish to be helpful to the Deputy. We already have a Cabinet committee, which has been meeting for the past 18 months, with representatives of all the Ministries and the health boards, the housing authorities and the housing section of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which is looking after reception, education and health facilities, with an enormous amount of resources and staff. The number working in the section has increased from eight people five years ago to more than 300 people currently. There are also people dealing with immigrants in individual agencies. The Deputy is correct in saying there are parts of this and perhaps other cities where the proportion is already heading for 10% and where local agencies, Departments and the education system are working well together to try to ensure the difficulties of racism and xenophobia do not arise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell has raised this in the House on a number of occasions in the past few years and I think they are making an impact, particularly in the education system. The Deputy knows that it is not unusual to see seven or eight nationalities in schools, particularly in infant classes of many schools in the heart of the city. Although there is pressure, the education system is working well. There is more to be done, but I think Ireland is ahead in terms of what it is doing in immigration policy. We are providing extremely good accommodation, facilities and follow-up services. Perhaps they are not perfect, but they are much better than in many of the bigger countries in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Taoiseach has said and having regard to a very topical programme screened last night on RTE 1, which Minister is responsible for the £4.5 million anti-racism programme that has been announced a <Col N="9" /> couple of times? When will we see it and who will co-ordinate it? This matter has been discussed on a number of occasion. Why after three years has the Government not matched the fine words with the moneys which were allocated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been discussed at social partnership level, though many other matters have. The programme is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. To the best of my knowledge it was announced and presented last year. Apart from that programme, through all the agencies, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify, the programme has been announced quite a few times, but it has not yet arrived. Where is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only has the Minister announced it, but has he not also provided moneys through grant aid to a number of organisations which have been working their own programmes? I attended at least one launch in the Chester Beatty Library last autumn, where the Afrikaaner movement had received grants. I thank him for the resources. I do not know where they got the money &ndash; I presume it is that programme but I will mention that to him. Through education and the health authorities, they and many officials are working extremely hard to help to integrate those who come into this country.</P>
      <P>To go back to Deputy Mitchell's question, there is a difference in classification. Most of the people coming in on the jobs front are people who have working visas&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what the purpose is. My point is we need to integrate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and there is not a problem with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that refugees who found work have identified racism as the biggest single obstacle they face to being employed, ahead of lack of qualification or lack of verification of their qualifications? Will the Taoiseach agree that the best way the Government can combat racism is by example and that the Taoiseach and other Ministers should be seen much more often in the company of people who come from overseas, particularly those of a different heritage, and should be seen to be visiting all the centres on a regular basis which are welcoming and serving people from overseas? By being seen in the company of people who have come in from overseas, the Taoiseach would be sending out, by example, a positive message of welcome. The Government simply cannot stand aside from this and say it is a matter for the health boards, the churches, the people or whatever. The Government must show a visible, demonstrable personal lead in the way the Taoiseach interacts with members of the immigrant community in <Col N="10" /> Ireland so that he shows by example, particularly as it is his constituency, a visible welcome so that the racism that is, unfortunately, all too evident on our streets is combated by leaders of public opinion and leaders of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with that. I have attended so many functions that I am afraid it is no longer much of a media feature. That is perhaps why Deputy Bruton does not read about it any more. In recent days I have been in the Vincentian centre. Yesterday I was in the markets area in the school which probably has the highest proportion of immigrant children. I have been in a number of schools in Deputy Gay Mitchell's constituency. I have been in Ballyfermot and Tallaght. I have been at the Afrikaaner movement function. I spoke at the Nigerian Christmas function and I attended several others as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is an over-concentration in some areas which can create difficulties, but there is a more complex reason, which we need not go into here, for that over-concentration. It is not altogether the fault of the local authorities, the health boards or the Government, but that is the way these things happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point about the Government and politicians taking the lead, that is important, but I emphasise again, although it is nothing to do with these questions, that it is extremely important to acknowledge that an enormous amount of work is going on. Who would have thought three years ago that there would be <Col N="11" /> schools with six and seven nationalities, without any particular expertise or planning, and that those schools would be able to cope as they do? That is an enormous achievement and we should acknowledge it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and in many other parts of the country. I saw it in Cork 12 months ago. However, I do not think it is happening in these areas to the same extent as it is in the heart of the city. It is working successfully but it is a new phenomenon and there is still much to do.</P>
      <P>When I attended the movement's meeting at the Chester Beatty Library before Christmas it was indicated to me that coloured people who have been living here for 20 years still hear racist remarks. Unfortunately, the problem does not relate only to the more recent arrivals. The statistic for the number one difficulty is a fact and we have to continue to work on it. Sometimes they are students and medical professionals, while others are working in various services and are well qualified. Unfortunately they get the wrong end of the stick from a small minority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the Taoiseach's remarks, is he aware that many of the schools to which he referred are looking for special needs teachers and other additional resources to deal with the phenomenon he has described and that there is no mechanism for dealing with it on a satisfactory basis? Does he believe the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the appropriate Department to co-ordinate an immigration and assimilation policy, bearing in mind the scale of the numbers who are here already and the likely numbers in the future?</P>
      <P>With regard to the questions on the Order Paper on the national implementation body which is designed to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions in the revised agreement or PPF, will the Taoiseach outline what this body discussed when, as I understood him to say, it met yesterday for the first time? Will we see a period of industrial relations peace, particularly in the provision of public services such as transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of education, it will be noted by the House that over the Christmas period the Minister for Education and Science gave extra resources for disadvantage across a range of schools. I am aware of the pressures and difficulties in some of these schools and they have been allowed to decrease their PTR. The reception integration agency which will soon be set up as well as the Cabinet group to which I referred will co-ordinate the services for refugees across all Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national implementation body will meet quarterly to ensure the stability and peace pro<Col N="12" /> visions of the programme are maintained. It is inevitable that discussions and assessments of the IR climate at a macro level will arise from time to time due to various pressures and these will be dealt with by this body. It will not become involved in the resolution of specific disputes and will not encroach on either the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission. It hopes to provide a mechanism to monitor trends in the climate of industrial relations and what is happening to enable the social partners at national and regional level to identify the steps which might be taken to underpin the commitments to industrial peace and stability under the programme. It will act as an early warning system to support the arrangements to deal with the resolution of disputes. Like any body with such an agenda, it is unlikely to be successful all of the time but it will help to avoid many of the difficulties which arose, particularly in the fall of last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I admire the Taoiseach's comprehensive reply to the various questions on this matter, will he explain to the House why thousands of young girls and boys had to emigrate to English hospitals to get nursing training over the past five to ten years while Far Eastern nurses are being employed in our hospitals to keep them going? Is the Taoiseach happy that he has sufficient training facilities for Irish&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why must thousands of young people, predominantly girls, emigrate to Great Britain for training when facilities are not available here and hundreds of trained nurses from the Far East have been recruited to take up positions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of reasons. There are more places than ever in our nursing colleges. The reason people have difficulties getting into Ireland is that standards are higher. The entry standard is much higher here than in the United Kingdom. The Deputy is correct that many people who failed to gain entry to colleges in Ireland have no difficulty getting into senior positions. The reason we are bringing people into Ireland is that an enormous number of our own cadre leave, some for a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 300 Irish nurses in one hospital in Melbourne and there is a large number of Irish nurses in Australia generally and in the United States. Some stay for 12 or 24 months. The reason people go away to gain qualifications is that, regrettably for them and for all of us, they do not <Col N="13" /> reach the entry standard here. There are now more student places than ever but the course has also been lengthened. It is a degree course, which creates a difficulty for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is ample need for extra training facilities for nurses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always room for more training facilities but the dilemma relates to the number being trained. The Deputy will have seen the same figures as I saw in the newspapers last November where 70% of those who qualified after three and four years from some training schools were on the next flight out of Ireland for one or two year programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 32, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>With the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I attended the European Council in Nice from 7 to 11 December. As I outlined in my comprehensive statement to the House on 13 December, I was pleased with the outcome of the intergovernmental conference negotiations. I do not propose on this occasion to repeat my earlier comments on the detail of the Treaty of Nice. However, in broad terms I remain satisfied that on the key issues the deal we secured was a good one for Ireland and the best available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> Furthermore, the objective of the negotiations was to reach an agreement which would prepare the Union's institutions for enlargement. That objective has now been achieved. It was essential that we came away from Nice signalling to the accession candidates that the way was now clear to enlargement, depending solely on their capacity to meet the various criteria for membership. It is now possible for the accession negotiations to accelerate and intensify, and this will be a priority for the current Swedish Presidency and indeed for the EU as a whole over the next 18 months or so.</P>
    <P>As I stated before, enlargement is in the interests of Europe as a whole and of Ireland. It will underpin democracy and stability across the Continent and will promote greater prosperity throughout Europe. There will be many new opportunities for Irish exporters and investors in an enlarged Single Market. Given our historical experience and our experience of EU membership, we have a special responsibility to offer our potential new partners the same opportunities from which we were able to benefit.</P>
    <P>In advance of the Nice European Council, I met the Austrian Chancellor, Mr. Wolfgang Schussel, the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, and the French President, Mr. Jacques Chirac in Dublin, as part of his pre-Nice tour of capitals, to discuss the issues arising at the summit. During the summit itself I had numerous informal discussions with my colleagues, including President Prodi. I had a separate meeting with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair during the course of the summit, primarily to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland on which intensive work is continuing.</P>
    <P>With regard to ratification, I have said from the outset that our approach to the negotiations was to seek the best deal for Ireland and the Union, and thereafter to consider the procedures necessary for ratification. The question of whether a referendum will be required continues to be under urgent consideration. The Government will take a final decision when the formal text of the Nice Treaty has been finalised by EU legal experts and when the advice of the Attorney General has been received. I hope and expect that we will soon be in a position to take that decision. However, I have asked that officials ensure that the preparatory work necessary for a referendum is put in train to give the Government the full range of options as to timing.</P>
    <P>I met representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association at Nice to discuss the BSE crisis in light of discussions that were taking place on the package of measures agreed by the Agriculture Council to combat BSE. I listened to its concerns and argued strongly at the council that appropriate market support measures be put in place to compensate beef producers for the fall in prices. The Presidency conclusions reflected this input.</P>
    <P>I spoke to President Mubarak by telephone from New York on 1 December to discuss the Egyptian ban on beef imports from European <Col N="17" /> countries. I assured the president of our commitment to maintaining the &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo; rating of our herd within the EU and pointed out that the current problems regarding BSE relate specifically to developments in countries other than Ireland. As the House will be aware from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh's, reply of 12 December, despite positive meetings at ministerial, parliamentary and official level, the Egyptian authorities have since extended indefinitely their initial four-week ban on beef imports from European countries. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, his officials and Irish Embassy officials will continue to ensure that the relevant authorities in our export markets are aware of the safety of Irish beef, and they will work towards an early lifting of the Egyptian and other import bans.</P>
    <P>The reason for my visit to New York on 1 December was to present to the United Nations, on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, the gift of a sculpture of an emigrant ship entitled &ldquo;The Arrival&rdquo;. I was accompanied to the presentation ceremony by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, who commissioned the sculpture through the Office of Public Works, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell. Following the presentation ceremony, during which I met a substantial number of UN ambassadors, I attended and spoke at a dinner, hosted by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, which was attended by a large number of representatives of the Irish-American community. I also attended the launch of the North American branch of the NUI Galway Foundation.</P>
    <P>Between 7 and 11 January, I visited Malta, Cyprus and Morocco. My visits to Malta and Cyprus were further elements in my extensive and continuing series of visits to our future partners in the European Union and proved valuable in strengthening our relations. I developed a greater understanding of the issues of most concern to them and believe that they found our experience to be of particular interest and relevance.</P>
    <P>While in Malta, I met President De Marco, Prime Minister Fenech Adami, a number of his Ministers, and the opposition leader, Dr. Sant. We held useful discussions on the question of Maltese accession to the EU, the outcome of the Nice Summit and a number of international and bilateral issues. I also addressed the Maltese Chamber of Commerce on Ireland's experience of EU membership.</P>
    <P>In Cyprus I held meetings with President Clerides and other Government Ministers, as well as with the former President Vassiliou, the chief negotiator on EU accession, and Speaker Kyprianou. We discussed the Cyprus problem, Cypriot progress in the accession negotiations, bilateral co-operation and the Northern Ireland peace process. In relation to the political situation in Cyprus, I indicated that Ireland, in particular as a member of the UN Security Council, strongly <Col N="18" /> supports the current efforts of the UN Secretary-General to promote negotiations between both sides and to achieve a resolution of the problem within the framework of the various Security Council resolutions on the matter. I also made clear that, as indicated by the Helsinki European Council in December 1999, a settlement of the Cyprus problem is not a pre-condition for accession.</P>
    <P>I also visited Irish Defence Forces and Garda personnel serving with the UN mission on the island. Ireland has participated in the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus since its inception in 1964. I met the special representative of the Secretary General, Mr. Wlosowicz, and General Rana, the commander of the UN force. I addressed the Chamber of Commerce in Nicosia on Ireland's experience of EU membership. I have arranged for my speeches to the Maltese and Cypriot Chambers of Commerce to be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>My visit to Morocco was the first official one by a Taoiseach and provided an important opportunity to extend our bilateral political and economic relations, and further work will be carried forward at official level. I met King Mohammed VI and Prime Minister Youssoufi. I also met representatives of the business community in Morocco. My discussions with Prime Minister Youssoufi focused on bilateral issues, the Middle East peace process and the Western Sahara question. In relation to this last issue, the Prime Minister briefed me on ongoing attempts, under the auspices of the UN, to find a basis for the resolution of the problem. I pledged Irish support within the UN Security Council for all efforts to find an agreed settlement of this very long-running issue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Swedish Presidency, Prime Minister Persson wrote to me on 2 January outlining the Presidency's current thinking on the forthcoming European Council in Stockholm on 23-24 March. He indicated that the Presidency remains fully committed to implementing the full range of strategies and measures that will allow the Union to reach the targets set at the Lisbon European Council last March, including making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world by 2010. I issued a reply to Prime Minister Persson on 19 January reiterating our support for the achievement of the goals set at Lisbon and setting out in a preliminary way a number of issues of particular concern to us. Intensive further work and contacts will continue over the next two months and I expect to meet Prime Minister Persson in the run up to Stockholm.</P>
    <P>In addition to the progress the Presidency hopes to make on economic issues at Stockholm, I know Prime Minister Persson is, over the course of the Swedish Presidency, particularly determined to make substantial progress on the enlargement and environment agendas. I fully support these aims. I wrote to Ms Gloria Arroyo on 24 January to congratulate her on assuming <Col N="19" /> office as President of the Republic of the Philippines.</P>
    <P>As regards forthcoming international visits over the next four months, other than my visits to Britain in connection with the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I plan to visit Scotland on 11 February to unveil a Famine memorial and Wales on St. David's Day, 1 March, to address the National Assembly for Wales. I also plan to visit Japan from 9 to 14 March and Washington for the customary St. Patrick's Day visit. Preparations for these visits are being finalised. As I indicated earlier, I will also attend the spring European Council in Stockholm on 23-24 March.</P>

      <P>The House is aware that under Standing Orders 45 minutes is allocated for Taoiseach's questions and that has expired. I will allow Deputy Quinn to ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I happily abide by your ruling, Sir, but I am sure the General Office will understand that all of these questions were grouped together for understandable reasons and that a degree of inspired tolerance will be exercised when new questions are put down to follow up on these.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to indicate that, notwithstanding the legal advice he may get in respect of the legal text that will become available for the Nice Treaty which many people may argue would not technically or legally require us to hold a referendum, in the interests of maintaining democratic support and public engagement in the European Union project, the Government is committed to holding a referendum at a suitable time later this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to go through the normal procedure on this matter and Deputy Quinn knows this because he and I worked on the earlier one in Amsterdam. I would like to briefly update the House on a few important dates. It is expected that the editing work of the jurists-linguists group to ensure legal coherence in the official languages of the Union, including Irish, will be completed in early February &ndash; hopefully, in the next ten days or so. A decision on holding a referendum will be taken shortly afterwards and when we have the final advice of the Attorney General. The formal signature of the treaty is scheduled to take place in Nice on 26 February. In a formal sense, I think we have to wait for that but Deputy Quinn has asked me about this a number of times. I said this at the IEA function in November and last March.</P>
      <P>On the enlargement process and Nice, there have been very few side arguments in Europe this month. Practically all political groupings in every country, large and small, have been very supportive because it is a new process of enlargement. Not holding me to the final decision, I think the democratic franchise and the involvement of the electorate in that process would be useful.</P>

    <Col N="20" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the people should be given the explicit opportunity to vote on enlargement of the European Union which is the subtext of what the Nice Treaty is about? Even though the legal advice may be to the effect that, technically speaking, a referendum is not required, a political referendum is required so the people can respond to the very good statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the moral commitment we should have in regard to enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Quinn knows my view on this, if required. I have said all along, because of the importance of the enlargement process, I would err on the side of a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that we have to make a formal decision on that, as enlargement will affect things for the next ten to 15 if not 50 years. All groups in the European political parties, even the most Euro sceptic of countries, have strongly favoured these proposals because it is the enlargement process. That is not to say there are not some gripes about some smaller parts. It is important in this country as well.</P>

      <P>Suppose the decision is to have a referendum, will the Taoiseach indicate the approximate date when he anticipates such a referendum would take place? In relation to the European Union, now under the Swedish Presidency, has Ireland any priority it hopes to achieve during that Presidency? On the American visit last December, there are two aspects to which I wish the Taoiseach to refer. In view of the announced aversion of the Taoiseach to American dollars influencing Irish politics, will he confirm that there were not any private arrangements in relation to fundraising for the Fianna Fáil Party while he was on that trip to America? In relation to the current relationship with the new American Presidency, has the Taoiseach made any attempt to get an indication that there will be an engagement by President Bush in Irish affairs other than the published letter sent to Gerry Adams? Has any approach been made to try to interest him in Irish affairs and, in particular, in the peace process in light of the fact that he has not to date&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nice Treaty has to be passed by the end of next year, but if a referendum is required it should be dealt with this year. Clearly that is our intention. In regard to fundraising, I was not engaged in any dollar func<Col N="21" /> tions. However, I was involved in a fundraising effort for Galway NUI &ndash; I am sure, Deputy Higgins and others would allow me help in that cause&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but not anything to do with the political system. We hope to maintain US interest in the peace process in numerous ways, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, and many contacts we have made with members of the new Administration yesterday. Mr. Ben Gilman, former head of the international relations committee, now head of the sub-committee on European matters, and a number of his colleagues from the House who take an interest in Ireland, visited us at the end of a visit to the Middle East where they were dealing with Israeli matters, and to Cyprus where they were dealing with the difficulties between Greece and Turkey. They continue to have a great interest in Ireland. Most of that delegation were Republican members and it is certainly their wish to ensure that the people associated and involved with the President will take an interest. Precisely who they will be is not clear as the various positions have not been filled. The great strength in recent years was that the President's interest was enormous. However, we had great contacts with people such as Tony Lake, Nancy Soderberg, Sandy Berger and good contacts are an important element. The recruitment of staff will continue for the next six weeks or so, but we hope that by St. Patrick's day the position will be clearer. In the meantime we will continue to keep our various contacts fully informed. Our ambassador Seán Ó hUiginn will actively work at keeping the new Administration informed.</P>

      <P>I thank you for allowing me to make this personal statement. I would like, pursuant to Standing Order 43, to give a personal explanation to the House about information which I gave in relation to costs associated with the Sports Campus Ireland project. The information was given in reply to questions from Deputies John Bruton, Ruairí Quinn and Joe Higgins on 17 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It recently came to my attention that some of that information is not correct. Having investigated the matter, I have confirmed this to be the case and I wish to sincerely apologise to the <Col N="22" /> House for mistakenly giving incorrect information in October last.</P>
    <P>The correct information is that the cost of the stadium component of the Sports Campus Project was, and still is, estimated at £230 million, rather than the £281 million which I quoted from my brief. I overstated the cost of this component by £51 million. I am grateful to the House for the opportunity to correct the record.</P>

      <P>The Government has had early contact both with the new Administration and with Congress and I look forward to meeting my US colleagues to brief them on developments in the peace process and other issues of mutual interest within the next few weeks. Arrangements are currently being put in place through the Irish Embassy in Washington, which has been in ongoing contact with the new Administration.</P>
      <P>The Government has always appreciated the bipartisan nature of the support for Irish issues in the United States from successive US Presidents and Congress, and we look forward to this continuing in the spirit of co-operation, friendship and support that has characterised relations between us in the past.</P>
      <P>Throughout his election campaign and again in recent weeks, President Bush has made clear his support for the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, including in correspondence with the Taoiseach. We very much welcome and value this expression of support and commitment at the highest level of the new administration and I look forward to working closely with my colleagues in the US.</P>
      <P>The Government appreciates the extraordinary commitment and support of the US Administration &ndash; in the White House, in the Congress and from both the Republican and Democratic parties, throughout the peace process. It has been vital in helping us to achieve so much to date and I look forward to this very positive and rewarding relationship continuing, as we continue the work of implementing the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

Has any decision been made in this regard? Am I correct in thinking that this issue is still undecided and, if so, <Col N="23" /> what steps does the Minister and the Government propose to take to try to ensure continued interest by the White House in Irish affairs and, in particular, in the peace process?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The change of administration does not reflect any change of policy in the United States in relation to Northern Ireland or the peace process. The substance of the position is very much the same. The Republican platform when it outlined its manifesto to the US electorate had a very strong position on the Irish question and one which has been confirmed by the President in correspondence with the Taoiseach since his election. In response to a question from Senator Dodd at his hearing for the position of Secretary of State some weeks ago, Secretary of State Colin Powell agreed that the new Administration would see value in offering their good offices, where appropriate, to assist in achieving the goals in the Good Friday Agreement. The Secretary of State has just taken up office and I look forward to having an opportunity to discuss this and other issues with him at an early date. We should be emphasising the continuity of policy &ndash; the substance of the policy remains as before &ndash; and a full commitment by the President and his Administration to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept we can expect the substance of the policy to remain the same, will the Minister agree that in the past, before the Clinton Administration, when Irish affairs were handled by the State Department as opposed to the White House there was not the same understanding of the Irish position? Will he accept it is in our interest to have a continued interest on the part of the White House &ndash; which was established by President Clinton through the National Security Council? Will he agree we should try to lobby to ensure that? Has the new Administration given any indication if former President Clinton will be given a role of any kind in the peace process, be it as a peace envoy or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to point out that it is not for the Government to tell any Administration how it wishes to have its policies implemented. We will continue to work with the National Security Council, the National Security Adviser, Ms Rice, and with the Secretary of State, Mr. Powell, as we did with Mr. Berger and Mrs. Albright. In the briefings and discussions I have held with the National Security Council and the State Department there is a consistency of approach by the Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that the personal commitment of the outgoing President was invaluable. Every incumbent of the office of the President brings his own style. The substantive point is that the new Administration will continue with the policies of support and encouragement, which was the hallmark of the previous Administration, <Col N="24" /> and that the State Department and the National Security Council recognises that the Good Friday Agreement represents a political consensus never before achieved between the British and Irish Governments and the parties within Northern Ireland, recognising as it does the relationships which must be addressed against a settled constitutional background, for the first time since partition.</P>
    <P>In view of the response to the question raised by Senator Dodd, we have every reason to believe that the Secretary of State Mr. Powell recognises the value of the existing policy, that he will continue to support it and that he would see value in offering his good offices and the good offices of his Administration, where appropriate, to assist in achieving the goals contained in the Good Friday Agreement. This is what the Government would hope for and we will now build on the relationships, built up over many years, with those offices of Government. We have no reason but to continue with what has been an excellent relationship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>Reports about the possible environmental and health risks of depleted uranium munitions in the Balkans have given risen to public concern throughout Europe &ndash; a concern which is very understandable. In the light of these concerns, it is now essential to establish the full facts following a thorough and objective investigation. These facts must then be assessed so that any necessary action can be taken by the appropriate authorities. It is vital that there should be full transparency in this matter. There are genuine concerns about health risks and possible environmental damage. Anything less than full transparency will only serve to heighten these concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key issue is whether there is a link between the use of depleted uranium munitions and the illnesses which have been reported by troops who <Col N="25" /> have served in the region and by the local residents.</P>
    <P>There are currently a number of relevant international studies under way, most notably a study by UNEP, the UN Environment Programme, which is expected to be completed in March. In response to an earlier UNEP report, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation provided UNEP with detailed information on the use of depleted uranium munitions in Kosovo. This information facilitated a UNEP field assessment mission to Kosovo last November. I understand that, more recently, NATO has made available to this programme information relating to depleted uranium use in Bosnia in 1995.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment, within the Partnership for Peace framework, of an <i>ad hoc</i> special committee on depleted uranium to which all SFOR and KFOR contributors, past and present, have been invited. This committee is providing a forum for exchange of information among interested countries, particularly in regard to the various studies and other measures which those countries are undertaking. In addition, a number of European countries are also undertaking their own studies and investigations in this area. I hope the findings of such investigations will be shared with other concerned states and organisations.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give an overall figure for the number of Irish citizens resident in the region. I understand that 176 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving in the region and, in total, more than 600 members of the Defence Forces have served or are serving there. Some 58 Irish civilian personnel are currently serving with the main international organisations, including 39 Garda personnel. Since 1995, a total of 204 Garda personnel have served or are serving in the region. Apart from those serving with the Defence Forces, Garda personnel and other civilians with international organisations, there is a small number of Irish citizens resident in the region.</P>
    <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Defence, that a task team from the Defence Forces visited Kosovo and Bosnia recently to measure radiation levels and to liaise with the medical authorities of KFOR and SFOR, the two peacekeeping missions in the region. This team concluded that the risk of radiological contamination from exposure to depleted uranium munitions to our troops is considered negligible. Nevertheless, there is a need to respond if they have concerns regarding their health.</P>
    <P>The key requirement now is for objective information. I would, therefore, regard any proposal for an international treaty as premature at this stage. No such proposal has come before the Security Council. However, I will keep all aspects of this issue under review.</P>

      <P>I note the Minister is not committing himself to an international agreement. He suggests that studies are taking place in a number <Col N="26" /> of countries to establish objective information. In view of this, what are his views on the report in<i> The Guardian</i> of 11 January which suggested that a report was available to the Minister for Defence in the UK in 1997, which suggested that there would be damaging effects from depleted uranium? As Minister for Foreign Affairs does he not consider that the EU code of conduct on arms exports, introduced on 11 June 1998, has been made a mockery of because of the unwillingness to share information on the use of depleted uranium on both combatants and civilians?</P>
      <P>If the Minister is not to take an initiative on an international treaty does he favour the replacement or revision of the EU code of conduct on armaments by, for example, the 1997 international code of conduct suggested by 14 Nobel peace laureates? Does he agree that a serious question arises with regard to those who have hidden information and who, far from sharing it, have driven a coach and four through the EU code of conduct on armaments?</P>

      <P>The essential aim is to establish the facts on the basis of a full scientific investigation. Once we have these we can make an assessment and any appropriate action can be taken by the relevant authorities. Pending an assessment of the scientific evidence it is a matter for individual states to judge how to respond to public concern in this matter. I do not wish to rule in or out any option at this stage. The Defence Forces do not have any munitions containing depleted uranium.</P>
      <P>The matter was discussed informally at the general affairs council in Brussels on 22 January and the council will go back to the matter at its February meeting where I will raise some of the points mentioned by the Deputy. However, in an exchange of views among Ministers on 22 January there was a general consensus on the need to respond to public concern, while the importance of transparency and the need to await the result of the various substantial studies was also emphasised. The Commission has established a committee under the EURATOM Treaty to study this issue, but the EU does not have a primary role in that member states have the responsibility.</P>
      <P>An issue of concern has arisen. Fora have been established for the exchange of information, which may have not been the case before. For example, we can be part of the Partnership for Peace committee in an attempt to ensure that we get the fullest possible information. It is a matter still under review at the general affairs council. When all the information is available and studied, an informed decision can be made as to what is the best way of dealing with this matter for the future. In the meantime, the health concerns of those involved in the conflict in Kosovo can be dealt with.</P>

What views does the Minister hold on the impact on civilians of the use of this product? He is either in favour of a ban or he is not. If he is in favour does he agree with the need to change the EU code of conduct on armaments or does he favour taking a UN initiative in the interests of civilians and some kind of humanitarian practice? Is it not a bit much to ask us to sit back and accept that a new round of studies is now taking place when it has been published that information was available in 1997 which flies in the face of statements published in 1999-2000?</P>

      <P>Given that I listened to the Deputy's question, he might listen to my reply. He may not like the reply but he might listen to it. We are not sitting back. The Minister for Defence has instigated a number of proactive steps, both within the Defence Forces and in relation to other countries which were involved with us in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans, to ensure we can get the fullest possible objective information available in a fully transparent and objective way. The Government is not pre-empting the steps that may be taken as a result of our consideration of that activity and information available to us.</P>

      <P>I will be a little selfishly Irish because my principal concern relates to the Irish people who are serving and have served in the region. I gather from the Minister's reply that that involves approximately 1,000 overall. I am concerned about the safety and security of those 1,000 Irish people. If we are talking about depleted uranium being a coating on armour piercing shells which can leave a radioactive after-effect, what is being done to try to find out if our personnel may have been in areas where such shells have been used? Second, what medical screening or steps have been taken by the Government to establish whether any of our troops, gardaí or civilians who have served or are serving in the Balkans have had adverse health effects as a result of their living or working in the region? Have we sat back and allowed things to happen elsewhere or have we focused on the safety, security and health of our people?</P>

      <P>No, the contrary is the case, and it would be irresponsible for anyone in this House to suggest otherwise. No responsible Government of any political composition would be interested in doing so. Once this matter was brought to the Minister for Defence's attention, he moved immediately to ensure tests were carried out in the areas of the Balkans where our people served. The results that came back showed the risks were negligible. Clearly we are involved in international committees which were assessing the information which all the various countries are collating in the interests of the protection of their people. When we have an opportunity to assess all that objective information, we will make the proper decisions. Despite the efforts of the Labour Party Opposition spokesman, I have ruled nothing in or out in relation to what our response may be in that matter.</P>

      <Quest>the further steps that can be taken to convince the United States of the need to lift its embargo on Cuba; his views on whether the EU common position on Cuba also now needs to be reviewed with a view to encouraging the ending of the international isolation of that country.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2152/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>First let me reiterate the Government's position on the US embargo against Cuba. We are opposed to it and we wish to see it brought to an early end. We have regularly supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for its lifting, most recently on 9 November last year when the resolution, co-sponsored by Ireland, was carried by 167 votes in favour to three against, with four abstentions.</P>
      <P>As I reported to this House on 28 November, there has been some limited progress. US restrictions on the sale of food and medicines to Cuba were lifted in October as a result of a bipartisan initiative in the US Congress. Regrettably, however, the immediate practical effects of this slight relaxation have been limited, in part because US financial institutions remain constrained from extending credits to facilitate sales of food and medicine to Cuba.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the limited measures adopted by the US Senate and House of Representatives last year had both Republican and Democratic support, I hope very much that the new US Administration will consider a full review of the embargo. There are other options available to the United States for persuading the Cuban Government to observe its international obligations in respect of human rights. I am aware of reports that Secretary of State Colin Powell is keen to evaluate the efficacy of existing US sanctions policy in general. Despite negative indications given by Vice-President Cheney last weekend concerning the possible lifting of the embargo on Cuba, it would be timely for any general review by the new Administration to include the case of Cuba. In this context, I hope the US Administration will consider the approach that is being followed by the European Union. The European Union's common position on Cuba is not designed to isolate that country. The EU is anxious for closer relations with Cuba. EU member states carry on normal bilateral relations across the standard spectrum of contacts from trade to culture and have actively developed their economic relations with the island to such an extent that the EU is now Cuba's leading foreign investor, principal trade partner, premier source of tourists and largest provider of development aid and humanitarian assistance. That is far from a policy of isolation.</P>
      <P>The European Union would very much wish to move to an even closer relationship with Cuba of the kind obtaining with other Latin American countries and which usually finds expression in the shape of a formal co-operation agreement. However, as the common policy states, the EU must evaluate developments in the policies, both internal and external, pursued by Cuba &ldquo;according to the same standards that apply to EU relations with other countries, in particular the ratification and observance of international human rights conventions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> Regrettably, the Cuban Government continues to fail to observe its international obligations in respect of many fundamental human rights. It was for this reason that on 4 December last, following a meticulous examination of the conditions prevailing in Cuba, the EU General Affairs Council was reluctantly obliged once again to renew the terms of the common position, pending a change in Cuban policy regarding human rights and freedoms which would enable Havana to accept the standards applied by the EU, without any discrimination, to all countries wishing to have the kind of enhanced relationship with the Union usually formalised in a co-operation agreement.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, in the meantime, as the Council decision of 4 December last makes clear, &ldquo;it is essential that the EU should deploy further efforts to engage the Cuban authorities in a constructive and frank dialogue on a variety of issues of common interest that may actually produce tangible results, particularly in the political, economic and civil rights spheres. Confidence-building measures should thus continue to be implemented in the spirit of the common position, which will be maintained as the basis of EU-Cuban relations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government will work to ensure that the European Union maintains its efforts to try to develop a new basis for a better relationship with Cuba.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to focus, first, on the US position. Is there anything further we can do to bring home to the Americans how silly, foolish and unfair this embargo is and, indeed, to point out to them that changes made recently are of no benefit because of the lack of credit facilities? Second, will the Minister accept independent views given to me and others who recently went on a delegation to Cuba that the EU common position may be contributing to the isolation of Cuba and that that common position should now be reviewed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to point out that the EU common position is not one of isolation, it is at variance with the US position. It is a US embargo, not a UN embargo. In a recent review by the GAC of the common position, the eighth evaluation of the common position took place and was reported on in December to the GAC. We reluctantly had to continue with the existing common position, even though we recognise and made clear in that Council decision that it is essential that the EU should apply further efforts to engage the Cuban authorities in a constructive and frank dialogue on a variety of issues of common interest that may actually produce tangible results, particularly in the political, economic and civil rights spheres. Confidence-building measures should thus continue to be implemented in the spirit of the common position which will be maintained as the basis of EU-Cuban relations. We will work to ensure the European Union maintains its efforts to develop <Col N="31" /> a new basis for a better relationship with Cuba. While the common position, for the reasons outlined, remains in place, there is still within that evaluation confirmation that we will continue to try to achieve tangible results on the basis of a continuing dialogue.</P>

Does he also accept the parliamentary delegation met independent people, including senior representatives of the Church, who indicated that they believe the EU's common position will not contribute to ending Cuba's isolation? In the event that people might believe the parliamentary delegation is in favour of everything that happens in Cuba, I wish to point out that the regime there is communist and it is obvious that people are being denied certain civil and political rights.

      <P>The treaty agreed in December by the Heads of State and Government of the European Union at the European Council in Nice will be formally signed on 26 February in Nice by the Foreign Ministers of the member states. All member states are committed to ratifying the treaty by the end of 2002, thereby preparing the Union for enlargement to take place, subject to the satisfactory completion of negotiations, at any stage from 2003 onwards.</P>
      <P>The treaty marks the completion of a significant phase of the Union's activity. The decisions taken with regard to reforming the institutions and decision-making procedures will equip the Union to cope with the demands of enlargement, and to continue to operate efficiently and effectively with a significant increase in its membership. From a national perspective we have an obvious interest in the success of enlargement and in ensuring the appropriate functioning of an enlarged Union. We can draw encouragement from the satisfactory outcome at Nice in this regard.</P>
      <P>While no delegation achieved all its objectives, the overall outcome was a balanced one from our perspective. In particular, we are pleased that it was possible to maintain our position on taxation, which will continue to be decided by the Council on the basis of unanimity. At the same time, qualified majority voting was extended in some 30 areas where it will assist the decision-making process in an enlarged Council. The treaty also sees a development of the arrangements allowing closer co-operation between groups of member states, accompanied, however, by important safeguards to guard against fragmentation of the Union.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the position with regard to the Commission is that each member state will continue to nominate a member of the Commission until membership of the Union reaches 27. At that point, there will be a rotation arrangement on the basis of strict equality among member states. I believe that, having ensured that all member states will be treated equally, we were right to accept the package and to allow the enlargement of the Union to proceed on schedule. The agreement on re-weighting, while giving effect to the Amsterdam Protocol by increasing the weight of the larger states, also provides that any decision must have the support of a majority of member states, a valuable safeguard for smaller countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to ratification, I have said from the outset that our approach to these negotiations <Col N="33" /> was to seek the best deal for Ireland, and the Union, and, thereafter to assess the procedures required for ratification. The question of a referendum is obviously a priority consideration in that context. As I said earlier, the treaty will be signed on 26 February at which time the final legal text will become available, and the Attorney General will be in a position to give formal advice on the requirements for ratification.</P>

      <P>It appears that Ireland is the only country considering holding a referendum to approve ratification and that a parliamentary procedure only will be required in other member states. Enlargement is due to begin at the end of 2002, so we have until that date to ensure ratification takes place, that the process can proceed and that applicant states can become members. As the Taoiseach outlined earlier, while we have until the end of 2002, it would be his intention, should the formal advice indicate that a referendum is required, to hold such a referendum during the course of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>What emerged from Nice is that there is political consensus for the 15 to move forward. The treaty represents political agreement by the Governments. While there are various institutions within the Union, such as the Commission or the European Parliament, which had views on what they believed should have been the result of the negotiations, in the end it was the Heads of State and Foreign Ministers of democratic Governments who provided the legitimate framework for the signing of this treaty. As already stated, the treaty will be ratified by most member states by means of a parliamentary procedure alone while Ireland may possibly require such a procedure and a subsequent referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the position of institutions which had a particular view on these matters and on how their roles might be enhanced. As representatives of national Governments, we had to balance these competing interests to ensure the European Union can proceed with its enlargement process &ndash; the political commitment made in Helsinki in the first instance. That is what we <Col N="34" /> have done and the treaty represents a political consensus. There are many political theorists and people who observe political affairs who would question the outcome in certain respects. However, as already stated, it represents a political consensus and it is the basis upon which agreement was reached between the 15. That was no easy task.</P>
    <P>Both Portugal and France are to be thanked by the remainder of the member states for the burdensome and onerous task they undertook in this regard during their holding of the Presidency. As the Deputy is aware, there was a failure to reach a consensus at Amsterdam and we had to hold an Intergovernmental Conference in the past year to resolve the difficulties that arose.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive statement of Sweden's intentions is contained in the programme for the Swedish Presidency of the European Union, presented by the Swedish Prime Minister to partners on 14 December last. This document, along with an extensive range of other explanatory material is available on the Swedish Presidency website &ndash; www.eu2001.se &ndash; to which I refer the Deputy for detailed information.</P>
      <P>Sweden has set out an ambitious programme of work across the whole range of EU Council formations. However, three particular areas of enlargement, employment and the environment &ndash; the three Es &ndash; share top priority on the Swedish Government's agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the Intergovernmental Conference has been concluded and much of the early necessary negotiations with the candidate countries satisfactorily completed, negotiations under the Swedish Presidency will enter a more concrete phase. The Swedish Presidency has brought forward a very ambitious programme of work for negotiations with the Luxembourg and Helsinki candidates. This work programme is built upon the Commission's strategy of last November which was endorsed by the Nice European Council. It also takes fully into account the need for <Col N="35" /> differentiation and flexibility in the enlargement process. Ireland fully supports the dynamic approach of the Swedish Presidency. We are anxious to play our full part in the success of the programme of work and look forward to a positive review of enlargement at the European Council in Gothenburg in June.</P>
    <P>Full employment, economic growth and social cohesion are the EU's most important economic and social objectives. The Presidency has made it clear it will act to promote an efficient and ambitious follow-up to the meeting of the European Council in Lisbon last March and to ensure that the summit meeting in Stockholm in March contributes to further progress in areas such as employment, economic reform, innovation/IT, education, social security and welfare. It has already indicated that several issues bearing on demographic change and of importance to full employment will be discussed at the summit meeting in Stockholm. We therefore expect a very positive outcome from this European Council that will enable us to show to both Europe's citizens and the world that the Union's objectives defined at Lisbon are being taken seriously.</P>
    <P>Sweden sees the second European Council at Gothenburg as a key milestone in the Union's efforts to define an overall sustainable development policy. A strategy for the long-term adjustment of EU policy to the needs of ecologically, economically and socially sustainable development will be tabled at that European Council. The environment formation of the Council, attended by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will be most closely involved in preparations for this policy area.</P>
    <P>As regards EU-Russia relations, traditional Swedish concerns derived from its geographic position, with the added dynamic of EU enlargement, will ensure that relations with Russia feature prominently on the agenda during the Swedish Presidency. The Swedish Presidency work programme stresses the significance of co-operation between the EU and Russia. Ireland supports the suggested approach of the Presidency in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>We also fully support the suggested approach of the Swedish Presidency in developing co-operation along EU borders through further development of the northern dimension programme.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports the Swedish Presidency's priorities for the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. We share the high priority being given to human rights and to the role of the EU in preventing and managing crises, in particular by strengthening the Union's military and civilian crisis management capabilities. Sweden's approach to conflict prevention and to co-operation with the UN and the OSCE is very much in line with Ireland's thinking. We will work closely <Col N="36" /> with the Presidency to make progress in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Swedish and succeeding Belgian Presidency have been requested to develop proposals for taking forward debate, on a wide basis, on a number of topics relating to the future development of the Union which were identified at Nice. These include the status of the charter of fundamental rights; the simplification of the treaties; the role of national Parliaments in the EU; and a catalogue of competencies outlining at what level issues are best deal with, whether at EU, national or local level. The two Presidencies are due to report to the Gothenburg and Laeken European Councils in June and December 2001, respectively, with proposals for moving ahead with this process, leading eventually to the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. We look forward to co-operating closely with the two Presidencies, but will obviously wish to ensure that this does not distract from the priority task of securing the ratification of the Treaty of Nice. We also look forward to the active participation of the candidate countries in this process.</P>

I updated the website yesterday and the Deputy can look at it today. The Deputy will know it is important to be accurate for reasons of transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority issues mentioned by the Swedish Foreign Minister during our discussion are those mentioned in my reply. I will bring any other issues raised with me to her attention. We could agree with the main objectives she outlined for the Swedish Presidency.

      <P>Earlier, I asked the Taoiseach, although he did not have time to reply, about Ireland's top priority to be achieved under the Swedish Presidency. Would the Minister accept that Ireland's relations with Europe have been somewhat damaged by the &ldquo;gung-ho&rdquo; bravado response of Deputy McCreevy to the EU Commission's strictures?</P>

      <P>We certainly do not and that is why we have tight laws on pornography.</P>
      <P>As regards transparency, much discussion is taking place, which is not yet resolved, between NATO and the EU on the arrangements which would have to be put in place concerning the procedure by which information is shared. Sweden, Ireland and others would have a different approach or nuance of emphasis than EU members who are also members of NATO. These matters will be and are being resolved.</P>
      <P>There are also problems arising under the transparency issue but not between Javier Solana and the Swedish Presidency. However, non-EU members of NATO have indicated concerns. Turkey comes to mind in that regard. It would be wrong to depict the current discussions as being a row between Javier Solana and the Swedish Presidency. The nature of the issue has brought about the delays in resolving these issues. However, they will be resolved in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any &ldquo;gung-ho&rdquo; attitude. We have a right to defend our national interests and we do so properly and appropriately. The Taoiseach stated earlier that we disagree with the assessment, as do many international commentators, given that inflationary pressures in Ireland have, in the main, been brought about by rising oil prices and the weak euro over which we have no control. We have not had an interest rate mechanism for the past two years since we entered the euro and this is one of the reasons we have little room for manoeuvre. If the Opposition <Col N="38" /> believes we should remove £200 million or £300 million of expenditure I would like to hear it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 110, 127 and 268 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the suffering of the people of El Salvador following the major earthquake which occurred on 13 January. The disaster has directly affected more than one million people or one in six Salvadoreans. The official death toll, according to the latest Red Cross figures, stands at 726 , but this number may still increase as many people remain missing. The impact of the earthquake was such that more than 180,000 houses were damaged, approximately 75,000 of which were completely destroyed. I have written to the Foreign Minister whom I met last year in Dublin to express condolences and solidarity.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government was quick to respond to the international appeal for assistance made by the President of El Salvador in the days following the earthquake. On Monday, 15 January, I announced an initial allocation of £200,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross, which had activated its emergency plan as soon as the earthquake happened. Ireland's response to the IFRC appeal is the largest individual contribution to date, enabling the Red Cross to undertake a timely and sustained distribution of shelter and food relief items to those most affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have more recently announced the allocation of a further £300,000 which has been granted to the Irish non-governmental <Col N="39" /> organisations, Trócaire, Concern and GOAL, who quickly mobilised resources and personnel in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. APSO was also involved in the immediate relief efforts. These are working in partnership with well established local groups and are co-ordinating their efforts with local government bodies and other relief agencies to avoid duplication of resources. The Irish Government's support for these programmes will help approximately 10,000 families to recover from the impact of this disaster and represents a total Irish aid response to the El Salvador earthquake of £500,000.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, to date have provided more than 17 million in bilateral aid to the relief effort in El Salvador. The European Community Humanitarian Office has also announced 2 million in emergency humanitarian aid, which will be distributed between a number of Red Cross societies operational in the area. The international response also includes the United Nations agencies such as the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the World Health Organisation, which are responding efficiently and effectively to the emergency.</P>
    <P>Overall, Ireland has contributed in a positive and meaningful way to the international response to this crisis. We do not intend to forget about the people of El Salvador when the international media attention fades. Ireland Aid has made a commitment to support rehabilitation programmes in the post-emergency phase. The vulnerability of Central America to natural disasters, which have caused widespread devastation and misery to the people of the region, is also being taken into account &ndash; Ireland Aid is seeking to support emergency preparedness and disaster mitigation activities in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reply. If further requests are made for logistical assistance for the replacement of housing, which I expect may happen, will the Government respond generously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we remain willing to assist further, in a financial way, to the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

We have indicated our willingness, in co-operation with the NGOs and the international agencies, to support that reconstruction and rehabilitation. We are reviewing the sit<Col N="40" /> uation on a weekly basis and I hope to have discussions early next week with the NGOs operating in the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The unspent backlog of EU funds, amounting to almost 20 billion across all EC funded programmes, is a matter of great concern to Ireland. I had an opportunity to raise this question directly with Commissioner Nielson, who has responsibility for development and humanitarian matters, when he visited Dublin last November. At our meeting, I told the Commissioner that this backlog is unjustifiable at a time of great hunger and poverty in the world. Commissioner Nielson, who has been very committed personally to addressing this problem, briefed me on the reform of the EC aid programme, which is one of his main priorities. The Commissioner also subsequently met the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The recent Court of Auditor's Annual Report sets out clearly the current situation with regard to the EU's development assistance programme. It identifies a number of weaknesses, including slow implementation of the programmes under the European Development Fund, considerable funds remaining unused and delays in programmable aid. However, the report also notes that many of the weaknesses, which the Commission reform process addresses, are points which the court had identified in its reports over the years, including the need for reform of the management of external aid programmes. The report urges the Commission to proceed with the implementation of its proposals for reform as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I remain concerned at the level of the backlog of unspent EU funds, there have been a number of welcome developments recently, which are intended to address the issues identified in the Court of Auditor's report. The Council of Development Ministers adopted an overall <Col N="41" /> Statement of EU Development Policy last November. This provides, for the first time, a clear mission statement of the EU's objectives in the development field and brings EU policy into line with the international objective of poverty eradication. The development council also considered the first draft of an action plan which will help the EU to give effect to the principles in the policy statement.</P>
    <P>The Commission is also implementing a comprehensive process of reforming the management of external aid, and its own internal structures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>Europe Aid, the new office with overall responsibility for Community aid, was established on 1 January. The complete programme cycle, from identification to evaluation of projects, has been placed under the responsibility of Europe Aid. This will help reduce inconsistency and overlap in the programming and delivery of aid. The Commission has also made progress in devolving responsibility from Brussels to its offices in the field. A list of 23 delegations to be included in this programme in 2001 has been identified, and the remaining delegations will be progressively included in 2002 and 2003. This will help reduce delays caused by over-centralisation. The procedures of the management committees of members states in Brussels have also been streamlined. These measures should help reduce bureaucracy and improve the overall efficiency of EU assistance.</P>
    <P>There has also been progress on improving the financial management of EU assistance. The Commission has proposed reforms of the financial regulation, and the use of more flexible methods of allocating budgets to ensure funds are spent as quickly as possible. Work has also begun on clearing the backlog of old commitments. Additional staff have been allocated to deal with this problem. According to the Commission, as of 1 December 2000, the amount relating to commitments unspent five years after their allocation has been reduced by 30%. The Commission has now started a second phase of this process and hopes to further reduce these amounts. The clearance of old and dormant commitment has proceeded more quickly than the Commission anticipated, and the reform procedures should help prevent the build up of a similar backlog in future.</P>
    <P>The seriousness with which Foreign Ministers view this matter is indicated by the fact that they reviewed progress on enhancing the effectiveness of EU external assistance at the first General Affairs Council of the Swedish Presidency, held on 22 January. Ministers received a series of reports on various aspects of the reform process, including a report from Commissioner Patten on progress to date and orientations for future action. They agreed there had already been considerable progress in improving the financial management of EU aid and in reducing the backlog of unspent balances. However, they urged the Commission to make further progress, partic<Col N="42" /> ularly in the context of the preparation of the 2002 budget. While much has been achieved already, we will continue to urge the Commission to accelerate its efforts to ensure that aid is delivered to the poor and needy as swiftly and effectively as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will agree that there is something peculiarly obscene about 20 billion being undistributed while, as she wrote last November, 12 million children under the age of five die every year and two-thirds of the earth's population, 4.5 billion people, have a life expectancy of 40 years. Following her meeting with the Commissioner responsible, does she agree that reform of the process of disbursing money that has been allocated indicates a very low priority to this issue within the European Union generally? Is she in a position to publish a report on what progress, if any, has been made on the reform of this scandal whereby 20 billion worth of aid remains undistributed by people who have aspirations of being a superpower?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept this 20 billion worth of unspent European funding is one of the great scandals of our time when we have a world of want and hunger, and that it is made worse by the fact that this amount has built up over a ten year period? Does she agree that at European level &ndash; I emphasise I am not pointing my finger at the Minister of State &ndash; heads should roll by way of reaction to this scandal and that it should not be glossed over because of the additional misery this maladministration has brought to the Third World?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the accumulation of such funds not drawn down by the Commission, even though committed by member states, is a scandal. It has been recognised as such by the new Commission and it is a very high priority of the new Commission. The Swedish Presidency has put it very high on its priority list for the next Development Council meeting. When GATT met in January a review of external assistance was on its agenda. These are not moneys lying in bank accounts but moneys that have not been drawn down by the Commission, even though committed by member states. Nonetheless, the fact that such bureaucracy and bureaucratic difficulty has prevented the disbursements of such funds is a cause of great concern for Parliaments, particularly in the European Union. I am satisfied that sincere and effective moves are being made to relieve this backlog and to put in place better financial regulations. The Europe Aid office has been established to co-ordinate all the European development assistance programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before raising a question on the Order of Business, I wish to raise a matter which affects very closely a Member of the House. I would like to express the sympathy of the Fine Gael Party to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and indeed all her colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party on the death of her husband. I had the privilege of listening to the Minister talking on the radio a few weeks ago about her husband, events in her life which occurred after the birth of one of her children and the difficult experience she had at that time. It was probably one of the most eloquent statements I ever heard from any politician about their personal lives. It was really inspiring. I am aware, therefore, of the great pain and inestimable loss she feels. As this is a House of contention most of the time, it is important that we pause for a second to extend a word of sympathy to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, at this exceptionally difficult moment in her life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join Deputy Bruton in extending to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, a colleague and Deputy in this House, our heartfelt sympathy. Deputy Bruton has accurately portrayed the sense in which she conveyed her relationship with her husband on a recent radio programme. We knew that Enda had not been well for some time, but his death came as a shock. On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend sympathy also to the Minister's two nephews in the House. It is a sad day for the Lenihan-O'Rourke family and it is also, by extension, a sad day for the Fianna Fáil family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Working closely with the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, one would have some indication of the deep sadness she feels on this occasion. Like Deputy Bruton, I too heard that interview. All of us will remember it with great sadness in the context of the death of her husband. I extend the sympathy of the Green Party to her and her family, which includes other Members of this House, the Lenihan family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, extend my sympathy to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, on the death of her husband, Enda. I know how close she was to Enda, how much she spoke about him and how much she suffered in recent times when he was not well. Although she is a hard-working Minister, she always looked forward to Sundays, in particular, at home with Enda and she spoke very fondly of going for walks etc. with <Col N="49" /> him. I extend my sympathy to her and her two sons, Aongus and Fergal.</P>
      <P>Enda O'Rourke's death comes very soon after the death of the Minister's brother, Brian. She has had to endure dreadful tragedy in a few short years. I extend my sympathy, as a colleague in Cabinet and in this House for many years, to Mary, her family and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Bruton, Sargent, Quinn and the Tánaiste for their kind remarks. Everybody who knows Deputy O'Rourke will know that Enda was really special. All she said in that radio programme was so true. She was well able to handle herself in political matters. She is a robust political person and always has been. Enda and she were married in their early twenties and were very close. Down through the years they have always spent together all the spare time they could.</P>
      <P>I was with the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, last night and again early this morning in the Mater Private Hospital. She felt, in the end at least, lucky that she was with Enda as he watched the six o'clock evening news on Sunday evening when he had a massive brain haemorrhage, which did fatal damage. He nearly died in her arms. He underwent major surgery and then was rushed to the Mater Hospital where he died in the early hours of this morning.</P>
      <P>I thank everybody in the House for expressing their sympathy. The Minister will find heart and spirit from the fact that everybody here was kind enough to mention Enda's death, and I thank Deputy Bruton for raising it.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend sympathy to our Deputy Leader. I join with everybody else in the House in extending condolences to our colleague, Mary, to Fergal and Aongus, and of course to Deputies Brian and Conor Lenihan who are Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, is the Taoiseach concerned that, coming in the wake of Mr. Justice Kelly finding the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Departments at fault in not being able to find a place for children who are troubled, that same judge has now found that he cannot deal with judicial reviews of deportation orders because the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is failing to supply the necessary documentation and has had to adjourn these cases up to eight times because of the inefficiencies in the Department?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must accept responsibility for failures of this nature and that it brings public administration and the Minister into disrepute if judges make comments of the kind Mr. Justice Kelly recently had to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue concerns the length of time it has taken to process the appeals. The Minister has succeeded in getting vast resources <Col N="50" /> and in recruiting almost 300 staff into that section of the Department to deal with the backlog. There are still delays but the Minister is endeavouring to have appeals turned round in a far shorter period. The Civil Service Commission is endeavouring to recruit more staff so as to avoid delays. The delays are regrettable but we are endeavouring to eliminate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is about judicial review of deportations, not about the normal reception arrangements for asylum seekers. People are not getting answers from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform where there is an appeal against a deportation order and that is not what the Taoiseach has answered about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who deal with reception and those who deal with appeals are usually the same people. That section has been over-burdened and has been seeking more staff. The Government has sanctioned more staff. Somewhere in the region of 400 staff have been approved, but the Civil Service Commission has not been able to recruit sufficient staff for the section and that is undeniably leading to delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a problem in the Chief State Solicitor's office as well, which is under the Taoiseach's aegis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main problem is in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because we have not yet achieved the full complement of staff that has been approved to handle this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the story of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach allow two Opposition parties in this House to be blatantly misled last year when, in good faith, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, at the invitation of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, met as recently as the last day in October to discuss possible changes in the legislation which will govern the next general election?</P>
      <P>We were not told of a decision already made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government as far back as February of that year. Does the Taoiseach recall that, subsequently, a one and a half page briefing from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government did not refer to the fact that the Government had decided, as far back as the previous February, to arbitrarily raise the expenditure limits and that an elaborate system of deception and misleading engagement and negotiations took place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A freedom of information request from a journalist to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, published in today's <i>Magill</i> magazine, shows that, as far back as February last year, the Minister for Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, wrote the arbitrary increases in expenditure that will enable <Col N="51" /> Fianna Fáil to spend, not £2 million in the forthcoming general election, but £3 million. Were you aware of that deception? Did you give your assent to the deception and the charade in which you were obliged to engage in your office as the Chairman of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, along with other representatives, when the Minister, as far back as February, had already made the decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;with very extensive terms of reference and that additional powers were conferred on them by legislation brought forward by the Government to ensure they would be in a <Col N="63" /> position to discharge their vitally important duties effectively, impartially and promptly.</P>
      <P>The eyes of the public are focused on the tribunals and the institutions of State established under the Constitution at this time. The public looks to those who hold office in its name to establish and vindicate high standards for the administration of public affairs and the discharge of public office. The inquiries being conducted by the tribunals are central to the fulfilment of that public expectation.</P>
      <P>It simply is not good enough to hope that standards of public behaviour will be established and protected without an honest and clear examination of instances where there is alleged to have been serious wrongdoing in the past. The Government and I have co-operated to the full with the tribunals and have been supportive of their work. Their job is to establish the truth in the areas they have been asked to investigate. Without prejudging their findings, much of what they have so far uncovered represents, on the face of it, a departure from the standards that both the public and all parties in the House expect, but we are looking at the exceptions, not the norm, whether for particular parties or the democratic system as a whole. We are also clearly engaged in a process designed to tighten up the rules and procedures applying to public life to prevent, as far as we can, future abuse of public office.</P>
      <P>All of us live in a constitutional democracy and the tribunal process, like any other process established under law, must comply with and vindicate the system of standards and rights accorded to every citizen by the Constitution, which is the fundamental law of the land. There are no members of an untouchable caste in our Republic. No one is above the law. That is our united determination. Serving Taoisigh, Opposition leaders, well known figures from any section of society and respected institutions are publicly accountable in this democracy for the way in which their business is conducted.</P>
      <P>By the same token, if no one is above the law, we must remind ourselves that no citizen is beneath the law either. Due process and the rule of law must be even-handed, consistent and fair. In moving the motion it is not my intention to prejudge or pillory anyone, but simply to demonstrate beyond contradiction that the Government and its supporters in the House are unambiguous and forthright in demanding that every citizen, whether elected to public office, should comply with his or her obligation under the law in respect of the important inquiries being conducted by the tribunals.</P>
      <P>Article 6.1 of the Constitution provides:</P>
      <P>All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Members of the House hold office and exercise their legislative and executive functions subject to that Article and, in the last analysis, at the instance of and subject to the verdict of the people who under our Constitution are sovereign. It is particularly noteworthy, as if it was necessary to say so, that it is the people who &ldquo;designate the rulers of the State&rdquo;. This means that it is they and they alone who decide who sits in the House.</P>
    <P>The Constitution accords to each House of the Oireachtas the sole right to order its own affairs by Standing Orders. Each House has the separate autonomous right under Article 15.10 to make its own rules and Standing Orders and to attach penalties for their infringement. Constitutional authors and historians sometimes debate among themselves whether it would be permissible for either House to put in place a penalty of permanent expulsion as opposed to temporary suspension. I am not in a position to state with authority how far the rules of either House could go in providing a sanction of expulsion for infringement of the House's rules. However, it seems that the right to penalise infringements of the rules and Standing Orders of each House of the Oireachtas probably relates only to matters particular to that House. That power does not confer on a majority in either House a right to penalise ordinary breaches of the criminal law with the additional sanction of expulsion. In so far as breaches of the ordinary law are concerned, Article 16 of the Constitution contemplates that laws of the State may provide for disability and incapacity to serve as Members of Dáil Éireann. Any such law would have to be administered by the Judiciary as part of the ordinary law of the State.</P>
    <P>The people have in the past made judgments about who should and should not represent them in Dáil Éireann which are by no means free from controversy but which must be accepted. Persons have been elected and re-elected as Deputies to this House in circumstances where some members of the public, perhaps even a majority, might have wished for a different outcome. From hunger strikers who were serving lengthy sentences in respect of crimes of violence to persons who had questions to answer concerning their own suspected involvement in subversion and illegal and violent campaigns, whether in the distant past or more recently, the electorate has exercised its judgment in a manner on which it is possible to have strong personal opinions but which, nonetheless, is democratic and constitutionally valid.</P>
    <P>I make this point not to reduce in any way the force of the motion which I am proposing but simply to remind the House that while we can express strong views on the subject matter of this motion, our Constitution reserves to the courts and people the final say on who can and cannot be a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>It would be a danger to democracy to give power to a majority in this House arbitrarily and on a basis made up on the spur of the moment to exclude or suspend Members other than for a short period. Under our system of proportional <Col N="65" /> representation, majorities are generally tight and we should be slow to establish any precedent which would allow this House to either prolong or foreshorten the life of a Government by reference to the unethical behaviour, real or alleged, of a Member. If there are to be new rules or standing orders because we find gaps in our procedures, they must be clearly established at the outset and known in advance, as well as being constitutionally sound so that there is no scope in the House for arbitrary exclusions.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific events that have caused the Government to lay this motion before the House, I take this opportunity to repeat that which I have often stated previously, namely, that I and the rest of the Government expect every citizen, and especially every Member of the Oireachtas, to co-operate fully with the tribunals of inquiry established under law by the Houses of the Oireachtas and to comply in every respect with the lawful orders of those tribunals.</P>
    <P>I have stated previously, and I wish to repeat without reservation or equivocation, that I and the other members of the Government completely condemn disobedience, non-cooperation and conduct amounting to contempt of the courts and tribunals. For us to adopt a different standard would be to scandalise public opinion and to diminish both the rule of law and the standing of democratic representative politics in the eyes of the people. While holding this office, I have a special duty to make clear that I expect basic standards to be complied with by everyone else who holds public office or who aspires to hold public office.</P>
    <P>At the same time, as holder of this office I do not enjoy the liberty afforded to others in this House to express their opinions freely and sometimes without regard to the consequences for the rights of others. I have to be careful in the language I choose, the circumstances in which I can speak and in the timing of anything I say. Some commentators and some Members of this House have said or implied that the timing and content of the remarks I have made on the subject matter of this evening's motion are dictated, wholly or partly, by a fear or reluctance of what others, including Deputy Lawlor, might have to say in public about myself and my colleagues. I wish to make it clear that I am not in the smallest way inhibited by any such consideration. I am not afraid of what others may or may not say or do in relation to me and I intend to discharge my office and to express my convictions in a free, forthright and fair way.</P>
    <P>There have been occasions when forthright comment has been condemned by the Opposition because it might prejudice a fair trial. According to a press statement on 27 May last, Deputy Bruton stated that &ldquo;politicians should not be interfering in court cases&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the constitutional right to due process should be scrupulously respected&rdquo;. Notice was given of raising a motion on the Order of Business on 30 May last expressing the opinion &ldquo;that Members of the Oireachtas <Col N="66" /> should not publicly call for particular verdicts in cases that have not been heard&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Even when court judgments are given, a right to appeal may be exercised. However, within those constraints, I and several members of this Government, including the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs, expressed views strongly supportive of the intent of the judgment of Mr. Justice Smyth, which was to secure Deputy Lawlor's full co-operation with the tribunal now and in the future and such co-operation from anyone inside or outside this House finding themselves in a similar situation in the future.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity to consider the approved text of the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Smyth on Monday, 15 January last. He stated that respect for the rule of law is enjoined on all citizens and persons within the State, especially on all who seek to promulgate, interpret or enforce the law. He stated that equality before the law is the rightful expectation of all those who come before the courts. He pointed out that in the matter of the obligation of citizens and persons within the State to comply with orders applicable to them: &ldquo;there are no untouchables&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Smyth, towards the end of his judgment, had the following to say:</P>
    <P>In structuring the punitive element of the sanction of the court for the past contempt I am mindful that not only is imprisonment a most intrusive sanction interfering with the liberty of the person affected but also his whole personal and family life, his financial position and reputation. In the instant case, there is the fact that the respondent is a Member of the Oireachtas. This does not in contempt of court proceedings put him in any better position than any other person in breach of a court order. However, a protracted custodial sentence could in effect and in a real sense temporarily be thought of as a disenfranchisement of the people who placed their trust in him and voted him to the Dáil to legislate on their behalf.</P>
    <P>This passage clearly shows that the judge was mindful of Deputy Lawlor's elected status when he passed judgment and that his continued membership of this House was taken into account in structuring the court's sanctions against him. In the light of those words, I do not consider it could be fairly said that the High Court judgment amounted to an invitation or a challenge to this House to attempt to expel Deputy Lawlor.</P>
    <P>The High Court judgment, however, clearly amounts to a challenge and an opportunity to Deputy Lawlor to avail of its terms to put right the wrong that was done. It is fair to say, as the Government's motion suggests, that the challenge to Deputy Lawlor contained in the High Court judgment about him is one to which he must rise and if he does not intend to comply with the letter <Col N="67" /> of the law and the spirit of the Constitution as laid down in the judgment, he would demonstrate such defiance of constitutional values as would justify the other Members of the House publicly and solemnly expressing their opinion that his role as a public representative was not tenable.</P>
    <P>Ultimately a motion such as the one proposed by the Government this evening serves only as an expression of opinion and carries only such moral weight as the public attribute to it. In terms of fitness for office and sanctions for office holders, the people make the decision both at the beginning and in the final appeal.</P>
    <P>We must be mindful that however strong our views, we are part of a constitutional order and are ourselves bound by constitutional rules and values. The strength of the Constitution and the rule of law relies more on the determination of the majority to uphold it than on the attitude of a minority who flout it. The moral force of democratic republicanism should not be compromised by those who wish to engage in expressions of comparative righteous anger. There are no shortcuts to be hacked through the rule of law even if its protections may seem burdensome to the righteous and inconvenient to the zealous. However, nobody is above or beneath the law.</P>
    <P>I derive no satisfaction from the circumstances which caused this debate. I am mindful that we are concerned not just with an office but with a person. I hope this debate serves to underline the values which we were all elected to vindicate.</P>
    <P>I hope, in particular, that Deputy Lawlor will avail of this evening's proceedings to state clearly and unambiguously that he understands and accepts the need to comply fully and effectively with the will of the people as expressed in the Constitution, the law, the resolutions of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the orders of the courts and the tribunals established on foot of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with deep regret that the House finds itself debating the motion before it. It is a sad day for the House and for Deputy Lawlor and his family. I do not wish to hear a vindictive tone enter the debate on this matter, a tone that was regrettably evident in much of the media coverage of recent weeks. That does not enhance anyone's standing or reputation.</P>
      <P>This is a matter on which we should never have to spend parliamentary time, if the basic standard of common respect for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the tribunals they establish applied. That basic standard was most unfortunately brushed aside in recent events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we debate a motion which has arisen from the conduct of a sitting Member, conduct rightly described by Mr. Justice Smyth as a scandal. While we would all prefer not to have to debate such a motion and not to have to witness such behaviour and contempt of court as we have <Col N="68" /> seen, it is proper that the House should make its views known on these events and seek to bring about desirable and achievable change by whatever moral influence it can exercise.</P>
    <P>The conduct of Members of the House in regard to our public duties has direct and large effect on the confidence our fellow citizens and electors have in this democracy. Fundamentally, the people are not stupid. They are not hoodwinked and blinded by bluster, bombast and evasion. Yet, their faith in their elected representatives and in our system of democracy has been tested unduly by the actions we have witnessed. That is why Mr. Justice Smyth's judgment struck a blow for democracy, for the people and for a fairer society. The House would also do well to recall and commend the fortitude of Mr. Justice Flood in the conduct of the tribunal which was put to the test in an unacceptable way before Christmas.</P>
    <P>The tribunals established by the Oireachtas are doing their jobs well. The Flood tribunal, in particular, has confounded its sniping critics by proving that, through persistence and determination, it can root out the truth. Ultimately, the tribunals' success, which I am confident we shall see, may be of such importance that we may no longer need their like again. They should have the deterrent effect of signalling that our democracy means business when it comes to fairness, openness and standards in public life.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prejudice the tribunals' reports, but they are uncovering unsavoury and disturbing information. Our public accountability is being greatly enhanced by the tribunals, painful and shocking though the information they are uncovering may be. The tribunals' effectiveness has been damaged and the cost to the taxpayers has been increased not by anything the tribunals have done but by the evasiveness and lack of co-operation displayed by some witnesses. Members of the public are eager to hear the considered reports of the members of the tribunals at the appropriate time. Everyone has a public duty to fully and speedily co-operate with the tribunals in order that the answers the public clearly wants and deserves can be provided.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has outlined the legal and constitutional position in regard to the powers of the House under the Constitution to remove a Member. He rightly pointed out the requirements of due process and constitutional order which govern all of us and to which the vast majority of us hold. We hold ourselves to these standards in public life even in the face of their being scandalously flouted by others.</P>
    <P>Although it is the case in other jurisdictions that Parliament may remove a member, I concur with the import of our Constitution that it is ultimately for the electorate to remove a Member of the Oireachtas. We should dwell on this fact in our debate on the motion even though it only concerns the deplorable actions of one Member of the House. The sovereignty of the people is <Col N="69" /> sacrosanct, not simply in an aspirational sense but as a practical matter which has particular consequences. We in this House cannot allow ourselves to forget this fundamental fact which drives all our efforts to ensure the Oireachtas is accountable to the public. As Members, we are but a conduit for that accountability.</P>
    <P>The practical effect of the people's sovereignty is that we cannot, in this instance, cause the permanent removal of a Member of the House through our will alone. That would be to disenfranchise the section of the electorate which elected the Member in the first instance, a fact clearly pointed out by Mr. Justice Smyth in his judgment. While we can and do sanction Members for unparliamentary behaviour and while there is scope for us to examine how the extension of the rules under which we do so may serve to encourage greater standards in the discharge of public duties, we should restrain ourselves from seeking to cause the removal of a sitting Deputy.</P>
    <P>If our Constitution did not prevent the removal of a Member by other Members of the House, the dangers would be evident to all. Such a power would be open to the abuse of a majority position in this House. It is better for democracy that our powers in this regard are limited. That said, I am open to examining the scope for broadening the grounds on which the House can discipline Members, short of expulsion, for behaviour which falls short of stated standards. As the Taoiseach said, these matters must be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>At this juncture, we must ask what course of action is appropriate in the light of Deputy Lawlor's unacceptable behaviour towards a tribunal established by the Oireachtas. Should the House seek to use its moral influence to effectively procure his resignation at this stage? Any moral influence the House possesses depends as much on Deputy Lawlor's attitude to the opinion of the House as it does on the collective view of Members of the House. By extension, Deputy Lawlor's attitude to the Flood tribunal before Christmas showed his attitude towards the Oireachtas. In so far as the House can bring moral influence to bear, it should be applied towards the goal of procuring Deputy Lawlor's full compliance with the tribunal. Deputy Lawlor should comply with the tribunal in the spirit of accountability to the public which informed the decision of the Oireachtas to establish the tribunal in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I, too, hope we shall hear from Deputy Lawlor today that he intends to follow this course with a change of heart and that we shall see that borne out by his actions in the near future. That must be the goal of this House as we cannot collectively ensure Deputy Lawlor's resignation, irrespective of how much any of us may desire it or feel it would be the honourable course of action. I and my party colleagues believe resignation would be the honourable course of action in the circumstances. However, we recognise that as far as the House is concerned, its primary objective <Col N="70" /> is to promote compliance by its Members and all citizens with the rightful requirements of the tribunals it has established.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that today's resolution should be constructed as it is to accord with the requirements set out in Mr. Justice Smyth's judgment. It is also appropriate that the House should express the view that failure on Deputy Lawlor's part to comply with the tribunal's requirements will confirm the untenability of his position as a Member of this House. Even then, that is as far as we go. We cannot force any Member to resign. Our resolutions on the matter of the resignation of a Member in whatever circumstances, irrespective of the Member's identity, will always have to stop at the point of moral influence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; where it secondly occurs and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the imposition of a fine on Deputy Lawlor by the High Court and the court's sentencing of Deputy Lawlor to imprisonment for contempt of the Flood tribunal and of High Court and Supreme Court orders of discovery and his consistent failure to fully co-operate with the tribunal renders his continued membership of Dáil Éireann not tenable and Dáil Éireann calls on him to voluntarily resign his membership.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a sad day for the House. In the midst of the controversy surrounding the Flood tribunal and Deputy Lawlor's behaviour, it does not give pleasure to any Member of the House to have to engage in this debate. However, we have a duty to ensure that certain standards are upheld in politics. We have a duty to ensure the institutions of this State are respected, be they the courts or this House, and that orders made by this House establishing tribunals to investigate matters of great public importance, orders supported by Members of the House, are not subsequently defied by Members in the context of their failing to comply with orders made by the tribunals or the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having acknowledged that this is a sad day for the House, Deputy Lawlor brought the difficulties which he is experiencing on his own head. He attacked and attempted to undermine the fabric of our constitutionally established institutions and, effectively, attempted to undermine parliamentary democracy. Deputy Lawlor brazenly defied this House's motion to establish the Flood tribunal and the House's view that he should co-operate with the tribunal. He also betrayed his constituents' trust. The Taoiseach's request to Deputy Lawlor to acknowledge to the House that he will now comply with the tribunal's orders replicates a view expressed many months ago by the leaders of all the main parties in this House. Deputy Lawlor chose to ignore that view. He has attempted to undermine the authority of the Flood tribunal as established by the House and to obstruct its work. The judgment delivered by <Col N="71" /> Mr. Justice Smyth, a careful and quiet spoken judge who does his work with great care, details the behaviour of Deputy Lawlor from July 1998 to the date he was sentenced to imprisonment for contempt of court in the context of his continued defiance of a series of High Court and Supreme Court orders and his continued failure to co-operate with the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The events which resulted in Deputy Lawlor being found to be in contempt of court were not just something unusual but rather a pattern of conduct extending over almost two years during the life of the Flood tribunal. It was a pattern of conduct which ultimately resulted in him having to serve time in Mountjoy Prison to partially purge his contempt.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of Deputy Lawlor has not only done damage to the tribunal and its work, and undermined public confidence in politicians and politics in general, but has been designed to discredit our court system by continuously over a lengthy period contemptuously ignoring court orders made against him. It could be argued that he was shown greater latitude by the courts than most litigants who behave in such a manner. As a Member of the House he has been subjected to unprecedented judicial criticism with which the Taoiseach now says he agrees, and which has now finally been acknowledged and agreed to by some other members of Fianna Fáil. This is an issue to which I will return later.</P>
    <P>The judicial criticism derived directly from a deliberate failure to co-operate with the Flood tribunal and a deliberate defiance of court orders. Scandalously, Deputy Lawlor revelled and flaunted his defiance of the House and the courts. By his alleged burning of financial documents which should allegedly have been furnished to the tribunal, still yet unexplained, which took place after he had been sentenced to imprisonment for contempt of court, and by his subsequent immediate return to this House after his imprisonment, Deputy Lawlor illustrated an incapacity to recognise that his continued membership of the Dáil is untenable. The Deputy has wasted tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money by bringing a multiplicity of court cases involving the Flood tribunal intended to postpone the day of reckoning and to destroy and obstruct its work. He first refused or declined the tribunal's invitation to give evidence or to provide information to it in private and took a court case on that matter. When the courts ruled he could not be compelled to provide information in private, and when the tribunal required that it give it in public, he then complained the tribunal would not hear it in private. He has sought to prolong the work of the tribunal as long as is possible and has consistently sought to evade his responsibilities to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor in various media interviews and odd pronouncements likes to present himself as a Don Quixote, tilting at an unfair legal system, when in reality he is seen by most people as some sort of political Al Capone. He is basically a blot <Col N="72" /> on the landscape of Irish politics and he seems to even lack the awareness of Ray Burke, a former Minister for Justice, that his position as a Member of the House is truly untenable and as a legislator is no longer taken seriously by any person outside the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor has a very specific obligation to the Flood tribunal and the Taoiseach is right that we should not prejudge issues. We have a tribunal in place to address issues which must be inquired into, but serious questions must be answered by Deputy Lawlor. Only one conclusion can be reached by those observing events at the tribunal and on the basis of information received and obtained by the tribunal through investigation, not all of which was obtained as a consequence of Deputy Lawlor's co-operation, namely, that during his time in public life he has accumulated astonishing sums of money from activities directly related to his political work. At this stage Deputy Lawlor has confirmed to the Flood tribunal that he has more bank accounts floating around the banking system than confetti thrown at a wedding. His concept of public service seems to have more in common with self service. Fine Gael believes his behaviour is incompatible with his continued membership of the House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach delivered an interesting speech. He stated that nobody in the House can compel a Deputy to resign, which is correct. It could be dangerous if by a majority vote we could compel a Member to resign. The Taoiseach stated that we should remind ourselves that people have in the past made judgments about who should and should not represent them in Dáil Éireann which are by no means free from controversy. He went on to say that persons have been elected and re-elected as Deputies in the State in circumstances where some members of the public, perhaps even a majority, would have wished it was different. He referred to persons being elected to the House who were serving lengthy sentences in respect of crimes of violence. The Taoiseach conveniently ignores the fact that our laws have been changed to ensure that persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment in excess of six months are no longer eligible to stand for election to the House and a person sentenced to imprisonment for a period in excess of six months, who at the time of the sentence is a Member of the House, automatically ceases to be a Member. That is as a consequence of legislation passed by the House.</P>
    <P>There is not an issue about arbitrarily excluding a person from membership of the House. The central issue is to recognise that there is a value system which is worth upholding in politics and in this House and to recognise that as Members we have very special duties to co-operate with tribunals established by the House. The House has a duty and a moral obligation to express a view in circumstances in which a Member consciously seeks to undermine fundamental constitutional institutions, to bring this House and the courts into contempt and to undermine the work undertaken by tribunals established by the House. We <Col N="73" /> cannot expel a Deputy but we can call on a Deputy to acknowledge that his behaviour &ndash; his failure to comply with certain basic values and to engage in certain basic conduct in which Members of the House should engage &ndash; has descended to such a level that we as a House believe his continued membership is untenable. We are entitled, and in the circumstances of Deputy Lawlor's behaviour, are obliged to call on him to consider his position and to resign from the House.</P>
    <P>The proposal by Fine Gael and the Labour Party seeks to compel Deputy Lawlor to recognise that he has dishonoured his role as a Deputy, should consider resigning from the House and proceed to do so. This is the central issue.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note a very profound difference between the two Government parties. The Taoiseach talks about duties to comply with tribunals and high standards in public office, a theme to which the Taoiseach has frequently returned and on which he has great difficulty delivering. He goes on to misrepresent the judgment delivered in the High Court. He quotes the passage from the judgment in which Mr. Justice Smyth explains that the longer Deputy Lawlor spends in prison, the less accessible he is to his constituents, and in which he explains that as he is a Member of this House, a sentence of three months, with one week to serve, allows his constituents to have access to him. The Taoiseach then goes on to say that he does not regard the High Court judgment as an invitation or a challenge to this House to attempt to expel Deputy Lawlor.</P>
    <P>What Mr. Justice Smyth explained was that the longer Deputy Lawlor spent in jail, the longer his constituents had no access to him but conscious of the concept of the separation of powers, Mr. Justice Smyth said nothing as to what this House should do in the context of Deputy Lawlor. The Taoiseach is right. Mr. Justice Smyth did not throw down any invitation or challenge to this House to expel Deputy Lawlor, nor did he comment on whether this House should call on Deputy Lawlor to recognise his public duty and resign. That is something the Taoiseach does not do. The Taoiseach does not acknowledge that Deputy Lawlor's behaviour over the past two years is such that he should resign but, strangely, the Tánaiste does. The Tánaiste made it clear in her contribution that she and the Progressive Democrats regard it &ldquo;as the honourable course of action for Deputy Lawlor&rdquo;. She went on to state that she and her party colleagues believe that would be the honourable thing to do in the circumstances. The honourable thing they talk about is his resignation from this House.</P>
    <P>The Government is deeply divided on this issue. The Tánaiste believes that the honourable thing for Deputy Lawlor to do is to resign from this House but the Taoiseach is not even prepared to publicly acknowledge that. The Tánaiste is bent under the Fianna Fáil yoke and although she believes that Deputy Lawlor should do the <Col N="74" /> honourable thing, she will tonight vote against a call made from this side of the House that he does that honourable thing and resigns.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has, since it came to office, engaged in the rhetoric of political probity but the rhetoric is not reflected by political action. The Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil's incapacity to decisively confront allegations of corrupt practices and tax evasion by members of Fianna Fáil amounts to a fundamental failure in public duty.</P>
    <P>There are values in politics that are worth fighting for but it is clear that there is no appetite within the Fianna Fáil Party to fight that fight. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on 15 December 2000, the day after Deputy Lawlor was stood down by the Flood tribunal, failed to utter one word of criticism in this House of the behaviour of Deputy Lawlor and attacked my call on behalf of Fine Gael that Deputy Lawlor be removed from the two Dáil committees, from which he finally resigned only last night, and my call on behalf of Fine Gael that Deputy Lawlor resign from Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>On 15 January 2001, the day Mr. Justice Smyth delivered his judgment, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, while urging Deputy Lawlor to co-operate with the tribunal, did not utter a single word of criticism of his conduct and did not even acknowledge in the terms the Taoiseach has acknowledged that what was said by Mr. Justice Smyth in the context of the events that had occurred was correct. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, kicked for touch on the same issue in the same way on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; that night.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children made an extraordinary intervention on Thursday, 18 January, reported in the papers the following day. With reference to Deputy Lawlor's shenanigans, he stated that he was always wary of people trying to tell other people who should be their representatives. He said that if one goes back 100 years, there were people in jail for different reasons, albeit for causes which at the time society thought were horrible and obnoxious, yet those people in jail had a very fundamental part to play in the emerging democracy. Apparently the Minister for Health and Children believed that Deputy Lawlor's continued defiance of the Flood tribunal over a period of two years, his continued failure to co-operate with it and his contempt of orders of the High Court and Supreme Court amounted to some type of patriot game, something that in years to come would be lauded as heroic by school children taught the history of Ireland at the end of the last millennium and the start of a new one. Had the Minister for Health and Children lost his mind when he made those comments or was there some substance behind what he was saying? It was an extraordinary intervention from a senior Minister who is pro<Col N="75" /> moted as the saviour of Fianna Fáil should the current Taoiseach choose to resign.</P>
    <P>What about Fianna Fáil and the values it upholds? It took the Taoiseach a number of weeks after Deputy Lawlor was stood down by the Flood tribunal to finally recognise that perhaps his continued presence on two important Dáil committees was inappropriate. It took until last week for him to even arrange that a motion be tabled on those issues. If the Fine Gael Party had not raised the need to remove Deputy Lawlor from those committees, he would still be a member. The reality is that despite Deputy Lawlor failing to co-operate with the Fianna Fáil Party's internal inquiry, and removing himself as a member, officially, of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, the Taoiseach was quite happy since June of last year that Deputy Lawlor maintained his membership of both committees.</P>
    <P>For Fianna Fáil, ethics in politics, maintaining good conduct, setting an example and accountability are not the primary values. The primary political value is to retain office at all costs. Although Deputy Lawlor resigned from Fianna Fáil in June last year, he retained offices on the Fianna Fáil floor, even moving onto the Fianna Fáil floor in the new building when it was finally opened. As well as retaining his two seats on the Dáil committees, he continued to liaise with the Fianna Fáil Whip to obtain voting instructions and, save for a few weeks in June, voted regularly with the Government on every important vote for which he was required in this House.</P>
    <P>Even more seriously, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, delayed the enactment of the crucial anti-corruption legislation to preserve Deputy Lawlor's support for the Government and to attempt to protect him from criminal prosecution. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000, was published on 4 January 2000 amidst a great fanfare of publicity, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stating it to be priority legislation for the Government. Having published it on 4 January 2000, Second Stage commenced on 21 June 2000, six months later, and then went into a sort of political twilight zone. It disappeared off the horizon and was not resumed until 15 December 2000. Committee Stage still has not been taken. What is the reason? The reason is that the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill prescribes new penalties to be imposed for those who abuse public office and receive money in a manner that is corrupt.</P>
    <P>I want to challenge the Government on whether its deliberate delay of a measure that it said was an urgent legislative necessity when published in January 2000 was to ensure that Deputy Lawlor was protected from the possibility of an early prosecution under that legislation, should it be enacted with greater speed.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil likes to allege that corruption in politics is a problem for all parties. For party pol<Col N="76" /> itical reasons, members of that party never miss an opportunity to spread the political manure and contribute to the public's growing political cynicism. The reality is different. Tribunal investigations are centrally concerned with Fianna Fáil former members of Government, TDs, councillors and Fianna Fáil associates. People outside this House, and indeed many Members of this House, are rightly sickened by the daily revelations from tribunals. The Fianna Fáil political effluent seeping daily from the Fianna Fáil silage pit in evidence given before the tribunals does not cast a shadow over Fine Gael, the Labour Party or other Members of this House. It casts a shadow over Fianna Fáil from events which have occurred for which members of that party are responsible and which the Taoiseach has utterly failed to confront and resolve.</P>
    <P>In February 1997 when he was Leader of the Opposition, the Taoiseach told the Dáil: &ldquo;What matters most is how a political party reacts to knowledge when it becomes available&rdquo;. Later, when speaking on the motion to establish the Moriarty tribunal he claimed: &ldquo;It is our job to do everything in our power to restore public confidence in the political system&rdquo;. The Taoiseach has done everything to avert his eyes when major problems have arisen, whether they have related to the former Deputy Burke, Deputy Lawlor or Deputy Foley. What about Deputy Foley? The Taoiseach moved a motion this evening to replace Deputy Lawlor on the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Yet Deputy Foley remains a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service despite the fact that he misled the Committee of Public Accounts and sat in judgment on banks when he knew he had an Ansbacher account concealed from the Revenue to evade tax. The Taoiseach's concerns, expressed this evening in his speech, about public probity are not matched remotely by his actions.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have become the political mudguard of the Government, maintaining in office a Fianna Fáil Party which is consumed by corruption. The Fianna Fáil Party, bent on avoiding taking political responsibility or taking decisive action when people are found within its ranks to behave in a manner which undermines public confidence in politics and which does damage to the standing of this House generally, has abandoned principle for power. The Progressive Democrats have also abandoned principle for power. Prior to her contribution this evening, the Tánaiste publicly acknowledged that Deputy Lawlor's continued membership of the House as a consequence of Judge Smyth's decision was untenable. She made that case in two separate interviews. Yet she now regards his membership as sort of provisionally untenable; that what the Government proposes doing by putting Deputy Lawlor on a type of political probation will again urge him to comply with orders of the tribunals. The fact that he has consistently ignored orders of the courts made over a two year period that required him to comply with orders <Col N="77" /> of the tribunal and to co-operate with the tribunal is something from which the Taoiseach and Tánaiste are now turning away their faces.</P>
    <P>The reality is that Deputy Lawlor and the two Government parties are incapable of coming to terms with the reality of Deputy Lawlor's position. We saw in England how Peter Mandelson resigned over an issue, the importance of which was minimal compared to the extraordinary conduct of Deputy Lawlor. The Tánaiste is prepared to put Deputy Lawlor on political probation, while in her speech she has acknowledged his position is untenable and he should do the honourable thing. The Taoiseach is not even prepared to do that and Deputy Lawlor does not even have the insight of the former Deputy Burke. Is it not extraordinary when in this House it is necessary to laud the fact that a former Fianna Fáil Minister who resigned in disgrace, Ray Burke, deserves some praise for acknowledging that at least he did the honourable thing and left this House? Is it not extraordinary that we can now put the former Deputy Burke on a higher pedestal of political probity than Deputy Lawlor?</P>
    <P>There is something obscene about Deputy Lawlor's insistence that he retain membership of a Parliament for which he has shown contempt. If he had any sense of decency he would resign and leave the political stage. He should go now and go quietly and should not, when speaking in the House tonight, engage in scatter-gun politics, spewing out false allegations against other Members of the House to try to take the spotlight away from his unacceptable and disreputable conduct. I hope we hear words of apology from Deputy Lawlor tonight. Nothing I have heard him say or seen him do either prior to his being committed to prison for contempt of court or subsequent to it indicate any real possibility that words of apology will be expressed. Deputy Lawlor may, by his conduct tonight when speaking to the House, do further damage not only to his standing but to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for failing to acknowledge that the time has come for him to go and for failing to call on him to do so.</P>
    <P>I have no faith that any of the Independent Deputies who regularly support the Government will recognise the seriousness of this issue but I call on them to provide support for the amendment to the motion tabled by the Fianna Fáil Party. I ask them to vote in the lobbies with us on this issue. It is important enough that they should do so. It is setting down a marker that there is conduct beyond which it is unacceptable for any Member of this House to go.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to new regulations or new laws being put in place to deal with misconduct by Deputies. Mr. Justice Smyth in his judgment not only sentenced Deputy Lawlor to imprisonment for contempt of court but imposed a fine of £10,000 on him and in doing so expressly stated that he felt the fine he was imposing was too low in the context of the manner in which <Col N="78" /> Deputy Lawlor conducted himself before the tribunal. It is noteworthy that the Taoiseach made no promise that Government legislation would be brought forward to change the law to increase the financial penalties that the courts can impose on those who act in contempt of court orders and fail to co-operate with tribunals. It is yet again an example of where the Progressive Democrats are looking in one direction and Fianna Fáil is looking in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste acknowledged the need for some unspecified reform, while the Taoiseach does not acknowledge there is a need for any reform at all. At the end of the day the Progressive Democrats, as they will do tonight, capitulate and go along with the Taoiseach. This House has not even been given a commitment tonight by the Government that it will introduce the legislation necessary to enable the courts to impose the type of fine I suspect Judge Smyth wished to impose on Deputy Lawlor if the law permitted him to do so.</P>

      <P>The Government has tabled this motion which calls on the House to express itself in a particular way. The Labour Party has tabled an amendment to the motion which reads: &ldquo;. . . is of the view that his conduct is incompatible with the standards of accountability legitimately expected of public representatives by those who elect them to office; that his membership of Dáil Éireann is now untenable and that Deputy Lawlor should now voluntarily resign his membership&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are two people answerable in this debate to this House. The first is the Taoiseach who in this motion is equivocal and unclear. It contradicts the position he adopted on 11 October when, in response to a call from me and supported by the other Opposition parties, he said that the Dáil should pass with unanimity and without debate a resolution calling on Deputy Lawlor to co-operate with the tribunal of inquiry and that if he failed to co-operate he should at that stage resign. We were told then by the Taoiseach, that such a motion, if passed in the House, even without debate, could in some way interfere with the rights of justice to which any citizen, including Deputy Lawlor, is entitled. I would like the person replying on behalf of the Government to tell me what has changed since 11 October whereby such a motion can now be before the House apparently without undermining the rights of citizenship which Deputy Lawlor has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue on which I want to challenge the Taoiseach is his deliberate assertion that the Government set up the tribunals. That is a parliamentary lie. This House set up the tribunals and demanded that the tribunals be established, not<Col N="79" /> withstanding an extremely reluctant and equivocal Government in its response to the debate that took place. We gave extra powers to the Flood and Moriarty tribunals because of the recommendation made by Mr. Justice McCracken in his findings in respect of the inquiry he undertook following the revelations by Mr. Ben Dunne about donations to Mr. Charles Haughey, former president of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has two things to correct. The first is the wrongful information given to the House that it was legally not judicious, possible or proper for the House to pass a resolution without debate because it would be prejudicial to the interests of a citizen and, second, he has to allow the record of the House stand clear that it was this House of the Oireachtas that established the tribunal and not the Fianna Fáil Party or the Government, as he claimed.</P>
    <P>I want to make something very clear on behalf of the Labour Party. We derive no pleasure, benefit or sense of achievement in moving the amendment and calling for the action on which I will elaborate. Our concern is with the reputation of politics, the standing of politics in this Republic and the damage that has been done to politics by the Fianna Fáil Party led by a Taoiseach who every time he has to take a clear and unambiguous decision when confronted with a failure to maintain the standards of behaviour which he said he wants from all the members of his party refuses to act until the very last moment.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is in that tradition. As a consequence the reputation of politics and politicians in this Republic has been damaged. It is in the public domain that more than three quarters of people in a recent opinion poll indicated they would like to see Deputy Lawlor voluntarily resign from the House and not to do so at the end of the tribunal or when he has completed his co-operation with the tribunal. He can and should do all those things and is under a suspended sentence for contempt if he does not comply with the tribunal. He does not have to continue as a Member in order to co-operate with the tribunal. That salient fact has not been clearly stated by the Taoiseach but it was effectively admitted by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>The undisputed facts are that a serving Deputy, Liam Lawlor, has failed to co-operate fully with a tribunal of inquiry established by the unanimous will of Members of the Dáil and Seanad; that he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for contempt of court as a result of his attitude; and that speaking of his conduct Mr. Justice Smyth said, &lsquo;That he did so as a citizen is a disgrace, that he did so as a public representative is a scandal', in a judgment of the High Court that was not appealed.</P>
    <P>By his conduct Deputy Lawlor has done significant damage to the Oireachtas and to the political system. It is the view of the Labour Party that such conduct is incompatible with the standards of accountability legitimately expected of public <Col N="80" /> representatives by those who elect them to office. We should not forget that this was not the first occasion that Deputy Lawlor failed to co-operate with a body seeking to examine the murky world of planning in the Dublin County Council area in the 1980s and early 1990s. He failed to co-operate fully with the committee of inquiry established by his own party, chaired by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in his capacity as chairman of the parliamentary party, and resigned from Fianna Fáil when that committee published its report highlighting his non-co-operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor was not the first person to have failed to offer full co-operation to a tribunal of inquiry, but there are few others who have done so in such a brazen and provocative manner. Deputy Lawlor did not just fail to co-operate, he effectively gave a two finger sign to the tribunal and, by extension, to the Oireachtas which established it. On one occasion Deputy Lawlor, or perhaps it was &lsquo;sources close to the Deputy', was quoted in the media as saying that he would not turn up on the day required and would be off playing golf. While Mr. Justice Flood was finding it very difficult to get Deputy Lawlor into the witness box, Deputy Lawlor was widely and freely available to the media to comment on this and express a view on that.</P>
    <P>It was not the first occasion on which a tribunal witness failed to give the co-operation required, but it was the first occasion on which a serving member of the Dáil did so and this adds an extra dimension of seriousness to the affair.</P>
    <P>I agree with Mr. Justice Smyth's judgment. I believe Deputy Lawlor's conduct as a Member of this House and public representative is a scandal and that that scandal should be dealt with effectively by the Deputy indicating his decision to resign his seat forthwith. We cannot compel, nor would I want the House to be in a position to compel, by way of vote the departure from this elected assembly of any Member, irrespective of who he or she is. However, we can call upon Deputies, in the interest of the reputation of politics and to ensure the maintenance of proper standards, to listen to the voices of their peers and the concerns of people who have, like them, been elected to this House; to take stock of the judgment given in the High Court; to announce that they will resign from Dáil Éireann and as citizens will continue &ndash; in this instance, Deputy Lawlor &ndash; to co-operate fully, as he is obliged to, with the tribunal of inquiry. That is the net point of the issue.</P>
    <P>We are being looked upon by the rest of the nation, which is looking at how we carry out our affairs in this House knowing full well that we do not have the powers to exclude or expel a Member, but, likewise, knowing we have the power to express our condemnation in clear and unequivocal terms. The Government's motion, on which we will be asked to vote, requires us to do exactly the opposite and that is why the Labour Party has tabled an amendment similar in tone and intent to that of the Fine Gael Party because nothing <Col N="81" /> less than a clear call on Deputy Lawlor to announce his voluntary decision to resign from Dáil Éireann will meet the demands and standards we have set for ourselves in this republic.</P>
    <P>I call on Deputy Lawlor, who entered the House with me in 1977 and who on a personal level must be experiencing a very difficult time, to consider objectively the appeal being made by the Labour Party, the leader of the Progressive Democrats Party, the spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party and, I expect, representatives of other parties in this House, with the sole exception of Fianna Fáil to which he no longer belongs, to listen to the voices of his peers and signal his intention to resign from this House because of the damage he has done to the reputation of politicians in general and to elected Members of Dáil Éireann in particular.</P>
    <P>In our experience of dealing with this matter, and other matters already referred to, what this House needs is a code of conduct. That would enable us to ensure that standards of proper behaviour are, in the first instance, identified and agreed by all of us collectively, that the way in which those standards would be maintained are clearly established, and that a system of censure, punishment and sanction would be identified, agreed and put in place. Given what has happened in this House in recent times and having regard to the fact that many other parliamentary assemblies have such a code of conduct, it is unacceptable that we do not have one.</P>
    <P>I want two messages to go out from this House this evening. First, a unanimous call from all the parties represented in the House that it is our desire &ndash; having regard to the facts, the behaviour in public before the tribunal, and the judgment of the courts, in particular that of Mr. Justice Smyth &ndash; that Deputy Lawlor should listen to the voices of his peers and signal his intention to voluntarily resign. Second, I would like to see a commitment in principle that we are prepared to establish a code of conduct for ourselves to ensure that we do not find ourselves in this situation again. If we did, however, we would at least have a clear mechanism of sanction to invoke and exercise collectively within this House upon any Member who not only fails to observe the standards set out in the code of conduct but also undermines the very sinews of democracy upon which this republic rests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party takes the view that the Dáil must censure Members of this House who steadfastly refuse to co-operate with a tribunal of inquiry. A Member who behaves in this fashion undermines the credibility of the Dáil, and although he or she may suffer the consequences in the courts, this House must also have recourse to adequate sanction. One such possibility is the removal of a Deputy for a certain period from a Dáil committee. We would join others in asking that Deputy Lawlor should voluntarily resign from this House. We believe, however, that the House should not have the <Col N="82" /> power to remove a Deputy; that should be left to the people to decide. We must certainly act, however, because the reputation of politicians and politics, which has already been severely damaged, will suffer even further if we do not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lawlor has already suffered the consequences in the courts, which I think he agrees were fully justified. It is my sincere hope that Deputy Lawlor will now reflect upon his situation, like Mr. Frank Dunlop, and that he will decide to co-operate fully with the tribunal. This means giving all records and details to the tribunal, and naming all the names. If Deputy Lawlor were to do this he would be performing a great service for justice and democracy.</P>
      <P>It is far too convenient, however, to portray Deputy Lawlor as the bogeyman of Irish politics. He may have benefited to an inordinate degree in terms of consultancy fees and legitimate donations, but he certainly was not alone. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that he was the only one at it, so to speak. The function of a scapegoat is to atone for the sins of others. Deputy Lawlor and others were part of a distinct and unsavoury culture in Irish politics which reached its nadir in the 1980s. I am very disturbed by reports in the<i> Sunday Business Post</i> about the voting record of the Tánaiste and the Progressive Democrats, those paragons of political virtue and masters of spin who have scaled the summit of the high moral ground. They have been quick to condemn others, yet, in 1983, the Tánaiste proposed or seconded seven motions with Deputy Lawlor for section 4 approval or material contravention of the county development plan. The proposed developments included a section 4 directing officials to grant a planning application by a Mr. V. Cosgrove for a restaurant at Rathcoole service station on the Naas Road. A planning official said at the time that &ldquo;the proposed development would endanger public safety by reason of a traffic hazard&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A material contravention motion tabled by the present Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and seconded by Deputy Lawlor, directed the planners to allow the development of a pitch and putt course by a Mr. Henry Beattie at Loughtown Lower in Newcastle. Mr. Beattie was a Fianna Fáil activist and a neighbour of the Tánaiste at the time. A section 4 motion proposed by Deputy Lawlor and seconded by Deputy Harney, directed the council to grant permission to another neighbour of the Tánaiste, a Mr. Noel Beattie, for a bungalow at Brownstown, Newcastle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lawlor, seconded by Deputy Harney, proposed another motion to allow Dennis Fitzgibbon to build a house at Ballynakelly in Newcastle. The development was in conflict with the agricultural zoning of the land. Deputy Lawlor and the Tánaiste moved a similar motion directing the council to grant permission to a John Harnett of Hillview, Rathcoole, for a house which was described by a planning official as seriously injuring the amenities of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> At that stage, a report had identified the Tánaiste as one of the most active councillors for moving the notorious section 4 and material contravention motions between 1982 and 1983. Having proposed ten motions, she occupied joint second spot with two other councillors on the 78-member council. Deputy Lawlor only came in fourth, so he was not up there with the best of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney was even more active with section 4 planning motions in 1980 and 1981, working closely with the late Seán Walsh. Deputy Harney proposed or seconded 12 section 4s with the former Fianna Fáil Deputy. We all know that after Deputy Walsh's death in the early 1990s, it was reported that he had received some of the biggest political donations from developers at that time. I remember clearly that when Frank McDonald reported on this matter in <i>The Irish Times</i> he was excoriated by people who said he had impugned a person's reputation and asked how he dared to say that people were taking brown paper bags of money. It has all come out since in the tribunals, however, and it is good that it has. In fact, when Fianna Fáil held its own internal inquiry &ndash; and I do not expect too much to come out of it &ndash; it was discovered that Deputy Seán Walsh had actually paid for one colleague to fly home from London to vote on a rezoning proposal.</P>
    <P>In 1980, Deputy Harney and Deputy Lawlor jointly seconded a section 4 motion proposed by Deputy Walsh for a 15,200 square foot, two-storey office block at Rose Cottage, Tower Road, Clondalkin. Both Deputy Harney and Deputy Lawlor also seconded a section 4 motion that Walsh proposed for a bungalow in an area zoned as high amenity at Glademore, Brittas. Five previous applications to build on the site had been refused by the council and the proposed development was said to be &ldquo;not in accordance with proper planning&rdquo;. This is, quite frankly, scandalous, yet the media and others seem to treat the Progressive Democrats with kid-gloves. We cannot do that. We have to say that they have done this, it is on the record and it needs to be investigated. The old reply to all of this is that while people may have received donations they were legitimate ones. We need to define what is a legitimate donation because it is being bandied about that people got legitimate donations. I am afraid when people rezone, propose section 4 motions and material contraventions in this fashion, one has to ask questions and I am here tonight to ask questions because we have a situation here where the Progressive Democrats pots are calling the Lawlor kettle black. It is a bit rich for them to do that.</P>
    <P>I also ask about the rezoning there and the problems in relation to Leamhcán in which the Progressive Democrats were involved. A great deal of credit has to go to my colleague, Deputy Sargent, who had the courage to stand up in the Chamber, hold up a cheque and ask if anyone <Col N="84" /> else had got one. He was physically assaulted in the Chamber. At the time people from various parties said he was a disgrace. I am delighted that he has been vindicated by the tribunals. There is much more to come out. If Deputy Lawlor has the courage to go in and name those people, it would be a great day for democracy and I urge him to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the widespread description of Deputy Lawlor in the media as an Independent Deputy. It is my belief that Deputy Lawlor is a Fianna Fáil Deputy. He stood as a Fianna Fáil candidate, was elected as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, is sitting on the Fianna Fáil benches, is operating out of Fianna Fáil offices, supports this Government and is being supported by the Fianna Fáil Party. I take it as a slight on Independent Deputies that Deputy Lawlor is being described in the media as an Independent Deputy &ndash; he is no such thing.</P>
      <P>Contrast that with the situation this evening where a Member of the House, Deputy Joe Higgins, has been suspended from the House. Democracy is being turned on its head. Deputy Higgins was suspended because he wanted to ask the Taoiseach a question on the Order of Business. He had to resort to picketing the House this morning. Members of the House who have held Ansbacher accounts, a Member who has obstructed the tribunal and Members of this House who have accepted corporate donations with no favours asked or given, if one believes that, are free to speak and vote in the House while Deputy Higgins, who simply wanted to ask the Taoiseach a question on the Order of Business, is excluded from the House. That is a scandal and a disgrace.</P>
      <P>In recent years corrupt payments to politicians, massive tax evasion, tax amnesties, toleration of bogus non-resident accounts and golden circles have been the order of the day. This has gone on during the course of several Governments. Deputy Lawlor's situation, as Deputy Gormley said, is just one example of this but there has been quite a bit of it in recent years. The sleaze and corruption in political parties is making the job of parents and teachers almost impossible. Public representatives and Deputies must lead by example. The mere avoidance of proven wrongdoing is a completely inadequate ethic to protect public life from graft and corruption. Public representatives must act in accordance with the principle that they should not put themselves in a position that there could be even a reasonable suspicion that they acted out of self-interest in their public functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The example being set by powerful people, including politicians, is corroding decent values throughout our society and is creating a jungle in which ordinary citizens are easy prey to the self-seeking. This moral crisis can and will only end when those who have compromised themselves are forced to resign from public office. The justice in the court case referred to the fact that Deputy <Col N="85" /> Lawlor showed contempt for the courts, the tribunals and this House and he suggested that it was a disgrace and a scandal. I ask Deputy Lawlor, as other speakers have done, to consider his situation and to voluntarily resign his membership of this House. Others should follow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation apologising to this House and its Members for the difficulties that arose following my evidence at the Flood tribunal during the four days I gave evidence. During those four days I answered all the questions to the best of my ability which I judged to be within the terms of reference. I questioned other issues which had not been raised in advance and which I could not have foreseen.</P>
      <P>I will now very briefly refer to the three orders on which I was summoned to the tribunal. There was an order regarding banks &ndash; that all documents and records in my possession or power relating to any accounts held in any financial institution inside or outside the State or any lodgements of money which I could be deemed to have benefited from should be discovered to the tribunal. It also requested all details on the second order regarding companies &ndash; all documents and records in my possession dealing with any directorships and any records of accounts held by such companies. The third order was to provide the tribunal with all documents relating to the tax amnesty.</P>
      <P>I set about and had discovered very substantial documentation to the tribunal under those three orders. What transpired over the four days dealt with a whole range of issues about which I willingly could have provided detailed information to the tribunal if I had realised it was legally required and had been given any request. As Members may recall and as was covered in the media, property interests in the Czech Republic arose and documents were handed to me in the witness box. I was requested to write out names and addresses covering over a ten or 12 year period relating to any property with which I had any involvement in the Czech Republic. I do not wish to be facile but one could hardly pronounce, never mind spell, some of them. If I had been made aware of the necessity to provide that information, I would have readily provided it and would have been very pleased to do so. Since then, I have set about providing a very substantial amount of detail to the tribunal, irrespective of whether it is within or outside its terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other issues arose during the scope of the questioning. Prior to and particularly after the four days of evidence to the tribunal, I embarked on a most comprehensive discovery of documentation, financial records and all other relevant information requested by the tribunal. When Mr. Justice Smyth made his orders, I was given one week for discovery of a lifetime of records. Mr. Justice Smyth's recent judgment determined that I should have until the end of March 2001, to make discovery on a fortnightly <Col N="86" /> basis, is a much more reasonable and realistic time frame. Yesterday, I supplied to the tribunal 73 lever arch files with thousands of documents. The process is ongoing. I have no difficulty whatsoever, and actually look forward to providing the fullest information and addressing any questions arising in due course at the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Since being stood down as a witness, I obviously have had plenty of time to read the detail of the transcripts of the four days of evidence. Having had that opportunity to review my contribution, I am far from happy with it. I fully accept that it was unsatisfactory and I take this opportunity to apologise to the chairman for the exchanges that occurred which were unhelpful to him in the difficult task he has to perform. I have no hesitation putting that on the record. On 14 December while giving evidence I stated to the chairman:</P>
    <P>All I can say, chairman, is I apologise to the tribunal if I didn't discover what might be discoverable and I will certainly endeavour to discover whatever material I can to the tribunal and will be very pleased to forward it to you.</P>
    <P>I have fully accepted Mr. Justice Smyth's judgment. I have served seven days and have paid the fine levied. I accept and respect the laws of our land and would not ever do otherwise. I could develop a number of points in mitigation of my offence. However, I am not here today to recap the four days of the hearings of the tribunal or the subsequent High Court hearing. I am content to have made a full apology to the House and to move on and deal with the matters that arise. I particularly look forward to addressing issues which are at the core of the Flood tribunal's work, the issue of planning in County Dublin, as suggested by Deputy Gormley. In that context I wish to quote Deputy Rabbitte speaking on a recent Olivia O'Leary television programme where he said:</P>
    <P>Liam Lawlor is a very able figure, a ruthless politician, a very effective street fighter, has been a leading figure in Fianna Fáil for many years. He has always held very definite views on the shape of County Dublin. I always found him to be a man of considerable ability. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject. He believed very strongly in what he wanted to see achieved and I disagreed with him a lot.</P>
    <P>I recall many times discussing with Deputy Rabbitte what should and should not be done in County Dublin and how, why and when it should be done. We agreed on a number of major job creation projects. I recall he was gracious enough to come to me and suggest that the whole argument about the Quarryvale issue was correct at the time and what was done should have been done because it provided badly needed facilities for an area in my constituency. Most certainly I have strong views on behalf of the constituency I represent which went through many revisions. I have represented the area for more than 20 years. <Col N="87" /> The transition that has effectively taken place has not occurred anywhere else in western Europe. There are two satellite towns within the one constituency.</P>
    <P>I was elected to three or four country villages in 1977 which today have a population in excess of 250,000 people. Whether one liked it or not, one was confronted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annually with decisions taken and objected to. It was stated that there was more construction, house building, town centres, industry than anywhere else in the country and within western Europe when the two satellite towns were developing. The third satellite town was Tallaght. The editorial of the<i> Sunday Business Post</i> of 21 January 2000 states:</P>
    <P>It is a basic tenet of democracy that the people decide freely who should be their elected representatives. It is their right to reject those they believe have failed them . .  it is up to the people to decide . .  It is certainly not the function of other politicians in Leinster House to demand that he step down.</P>
    <P>The joint-call for Lawlor's resignation by Opposition parties is as fatuous as it is cynical . . .</P>
    <P>Apart from making the Opposition appear righteous, the motion is aimed at prising open divisions within government. That's politics. But let us call it just that. Can anyone recall the demand by John Bruton that his former minister, Michael Lowry, should quit his Dail seat? Ruairi Quinn's lack of consistency is also on parade. At the beginning of last week he declared it was up to the people to decide who should represent them . . .  Meanwhile spare us the cant and the hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier by Deputy Quinn, on 11 October the party leaders issued a joint statement dealing with the Flood tribunal. It is worth reading into record:</P>
    <P>The Flood tribunal was established by the unanimous will of Members of this House. Every citizen and even more so every member of the Oireachtas owes a legal, moral and democratic duty to co-operate with the tribunal, not to obstruct it and to comply with its lawful orders. We would expect any citizen and member of the Oireachtas who disputed the validity or legality of any tribunal order to make his or case to the tribunal and, if necessary, to the courts.</P>
    <P>I recall at the time that that is what I did and yet it is being paraded here that this statement in some way had some other meaning. I fully supported the statement in its entirety. I had no difficulty in making a complete disclosure to the tribunal. The High Court has ruled that I must make a disclosure which substantially exceeds the timeframe and breadth of the tribunal's inquiries. I have no difficulty in making such a disclosure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> It is a fact of life that submissions such as this take considerable effort because great care must be taken to ensure the disclosure is complete and presented in such a way as to be helpful to the tribunal. It is a considerable task. All matters in which I had any involvement will be detailed as far back as records allow and I am actively preparing the outstanding elements of this submission, as per Mr. Justice Smyth's judgment, in fortnightly tranches to the end of March. I have been ordered by the High Court and will willingly comply and have no difficulty and irrespective of the court decision would have had no difficulty.</P>
    <P>I call on other Members here to make a similar approach. I have had the benefit, through the media in recent weeks, of considerable advice from colleagues, particularly from the far side of the House, and from the Seanad. It is a continuing subject of wonderment to me why these colleagues do not follow up on this advice by making detailed statements of their own affairs to the tribunal. I hope it will come about. Some have gone as far as to deny in the media that they have had contact with the tribunal despite having appeared there in private session and having discussed these matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the media for a moment because certain sections, not all, never fail to disappoint. A considered and incisive judgment by Mr. Justice Smyth was demeaned in certain sections of the media through its portrayal as some veiled threat to other tribunal witnesses or a punishment for availing of access to the courts. It was none of these things. Where a considered examination of the law of contempt may have been of value we were treated instead to a torrent of personal abuse and an entirely unfair and unfounded portrayal of our prison system as an AIDS infested cesspool of degenerates. Those were the words of one newspaper. Could you credit how anybody could pen that type of statement? The personal abuse is par for the course. The other remark brings journalism to a new low. In what is surely in itself a contempt of the tribunal, to be called to the tribunal can now in itself be considered a punishment. This &lsquo;guilty until proven innocent' approach is at the heart of many concerns regarding the tribunal. There are certain people whose names have been mentioned at the tribunal and allegations made against them, some of which are running for 12 months, and they have not had the opportunity to address or refute those allegations.</P>
    <P>No less a person than Mr. Justice Kearns in the course of his hearing of my earlier case in the High Court referred to the assumed powers of the Flood tribunal as draconian and incredible. However, it is fine that Liam Lawlor should be subjected to that situation. To say that some of the media coverage was over-kill is an understatement.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental to the Constitution that all Members of this House are equal. We are not here as individuals or as party members but as representatives of our constituents. Many seem to <Col N="89" /> have forgotten this important principle of representation. The motion before the House seeks to frustrate that basic constitutional right of the people to choose their representatives. It seeks to allow a populous media and an increasingly panicked Opposition to decide who represents my constituents. The people of Dublin West returned me to Dáil Éireann in 1997 and the people of the successor constituency, Dublin Midwest, will decide in the next general election who their representative should be.</P>
    <P>When Deputies are contacted by the Flood tribunal and are asked to match my level of disclosure I have no doubt they will fully co-operate. This will involve producing business and private documents and financial records for the past 26 years and records of telephone calls for the past six years. If full disclosure of all one's dealings is a standard for one Member it should be standard for all. I have nothing to fear and I look forward to all my colleagues meeting the same high standard on which they pontificate.</P>
    <P>An interesting feature of my dealings with the tribunal is its confirmation that its initial reason for seeking information from me was based on media reports. Receiving a letter asking for a response to what was contained in a Sunday newspaper initially raised one's shoulders. Another colleague received a letter requesting co-operation, but the first communication I received was on foot of a newspaper article. Probably two years later the basis of that article still has not been investigated. The source of the information to the article has not even visited this country to attend a tribunal. I hope that will happen. I look forward to those who have allegations to make doing so at the tribunal and to having the opportunity to hear them and consider the truth of them or otherwise. That has not happened yet.</P>
    <P>Many of the ill-informed comments from Opposition leaders and other Oireachtas Members throughout this week have been based on those media reports. The media star chamber has decided that I must be guilty, I do not know of what. I am not aware of one allegation the tribunal has made. I have asked several times, as has my legal team. If there are allegations and I am informed of them I will deal with them, but as I address this House and correspond with the tribunal, it has skirted around the fact that it does not have any allegations.</P>
    <P>The absence of a shred of evidence or even a clear accusation seems to count for nothing. The leaders on the other side of the House have refused to account for their own actions. They believe they have the right to be judge, jury and executioner and to take from my constituents their right to representation. I will not allow that to happen and I ask all Members of the House to reflect on this core issue at the heart of their amendments. To be fair, Deputy Quinn referred to this when he first commented on the issue and this was reported in the<i> Sunday Business Post.</i><Col N="90" /> I am heartened by the strong statement last week by the chairman of the Flood tribunal censuring the interference in its work by the media and reminding those involved of the penalties for this form of contempt. I understand this was done on the basis of references to 13 politicians and the suggestion by the chairman that the leak could have come from some banking sources. It is a belated recognition that there has been much media coverage of &ldquo;what might be alleged&rdquo; against various people, yet unproven.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to my support for the Government and there has been considerable talk and innuendo regarding my ongoing support. In this respect imaginations have run riot with talk of secret deals and special treatment. My treatment from my former party has been far from special, however, I accept that is part of politics and a necessary if unpleasant part of the ongoing process. My support for Fianna Fáil and this Fianna Fáil-led Government is based on no special deal but on honour and respect. I was elected as a Fianna Fáil Deputy and I was a life long member of the party until my resignation last year. The purpose of that resignation was to remove from the Opposition the opportunity to use my situation to distract from the work of the Government. The Government will continue to deliver for the people of my constituency and the country. More importantly, given what has been trumpeted about opinion polls, Opposition parties could do well to learn the lesson that the people believe, as they always have, that negative, sneering politics is not popular in Ireland. The Fine Gael Party is in the process of learning it.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the serious allegation carried in recent headlines in the <i>Sunday World.</i> To the best of my knowledge a journalist and photographer from the newspaper trespassed into my garden and removed papers that had been discarded under the supervision of my solicitor. After four days of evidence to the tribunal, on the 12, 13, 14 and 15 December, I had a meeting with my legal team. We were already embarking on a further discovery for the tribunal of a range of documentation. In the witness box I made several commitments to the tribunal to the effect that had I been aware I would have discovered certain details. I was cataloguing these commitments to ensure my compliance with the tribunal's request. At that meeting it was agreed that my legal team would take total charge of the ongoing discovery requirements and my solicitor and counsel virtually took up residence in my office from December 22 to oversee and supervise this under a range of headings.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform the House &ndash; I will in due course inform the <i>Sunday World</i>&ndash; that the credit card copy statements it published in its edition of 21 January had already been discovered and brought to the attention of the legal team to the tribunal's council, I think on 3 January. In my affidavit, sworn and handed over to Mr. Justice Smyth's court, I stated I had discovered this material to the tribunal and I can so inform the <Col N="91" /> House. I believe that was on 9 January, but I wish to be cautious about what I say.</P>
    <P>The<i> Sunday World</i> will in due course have the opportunity to address the accuracy, or otherwise, of its headlines, based on the legal action I am proposing to rigorously pursue with that newspaper. While two members of the<i> Sunday World</i> staff were illegally removing papers from my home, another senior journalist from that newspaper knocked on the door of a life-long friend and colleague in Lucan and informed his wife that if her husband would speak to him it would be to his benefit. I do not know what that means, but that is what was said. In difficult times comforts come from unexpected sources. My office and home have been inundated with telephone calls, notes and other expressions of sympathy from my constituency and from all over the country. I offer my heartfelt thanks to everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the Dublin West constituency and to what one was confronted with there, but before doing so I will comment on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. At a recent meeting of the committee I referred to certain matters. I did not make any allegations against anybody, rather I suggested that certain matters should be investigated. Is it not the heart of this debate that matters should be investigated?</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter was a member of Dublin County Council. He recently appeared on television with Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy McGuiness and Senator Dardis, who I do not believe has been elected to any position. Having failed several times to be elected to this House in the Kildare constituency he sees fit to lecture me and to advise what others should do. Fine Gael's involvement in planning decisions probably will, and should, be investigated. I do not make an allegation, but I ask were letters written promising that certain Fine Gael votes could be secured if certain business was secured associated with certain projects? Was illegal action initiated to pursue such a deal? I have no doubt Deputy Shatter will vigorously pursue this matter. I also have no doubt that in the fullness of time, issues associated with the Labour Party will be fully investigated in the interests of truth, transparency and integrity. Regarding those actions from some of its Oireachtas Members these issues, when investigated, will not rock the foundations of the State, but they will rock the foundations of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy John McGuinness appeared recently on a television programme and spoke about what I should and should not do. He is not long in the House and I have no doubt that in the fullness of time he will be able to co-operate vigorously with the tribunal, on his association with, not him directly to the best of my knowledge, a countyman of his and a close colleague of his, his brother, and that they will be able to address a major controversial <Col N="92" /> rezoning at Dublin Airport which was vigorously opposed by Aer Rianta. This went through and is now probably the basis for a major development.</P>

      <P>I thank Members, 99% of whom listened to my contribution with courtesy, for their attention. I was elected to this House in 1977 and throughout the years my respect for the standards and democracy it represents has not diminished. To date, I have not entered the Dáil Chamber without feeling a sense of humility at its traditions and the history of that Assembly. I stand here this evening more conscious than ever of the responsibilities and privileges membership of this House brings. I fully commit myself to upholding those responsibilities for as long as my constituents decide I should have the honour of representing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say something about disclosure and co-operation with the Flood tribunal. I never had difficulty, and do not have difficulty, disclosing every piece of information available which can be <Col N="93" /> secured, disclosed or dealt with at the tribunal. Given the wisdom of hindsight, I probably got a little agitated and a little uptight about the fact that false allegations, in my view, yet to be proven, were made in various newspapers and taken as fact. In the fullness of time, I will deal with all those matters at the tribunal. I have no problem dealing with them. I have now given, even though it was not asked for under the orders, a comprehensive financial statement to the tribunal. I was confronted in the witness box at the tribunal with a list of figures, which was not part of any of the orders to which I have referred. I said at the time to the chairman that I would prepare such a response in co-operation with my accountants, which I have since done. If I had been asked for this in advance of going to the tribunal, I would have provided that information, including issues regarding the Czech Republic and so on. I have no problem dealing with these matters, which are now being dealt with. I have been given a reasonable timeframe by Mr. Justice Smyth in which to deal with the issue. I will attend the tribunal and address all issues arising from my exercising of my public duties.</P>
    <P>I resigned from Dublin County Council in June 1991. I was not even a member of the council when so many matters which were the basis of the investigations of this tribunal were going on. I made the decision on the Quarryvale project &ndash; Deputy Currie and the late Deputy Lenihan also represented that constituency &ndash; because Blanchardstown and Clondalkin-Lucan were two fledgling satellite towns, the population having increased to more than 50,000. Tallaght had to get special tax designation to have its town centre built. We had a responsibility to oversee progress in these two areas where thousands of people were disenfranchised, particularly in north Clondalkin. This has been a very prominent part of my constituency in which I have received substantial support over the years. We reached what we believed was a fair and reasonable compromise about these two centres.</P>
    <P>One of the developers in the Blanchardstown centre went berserk with a programme of disinformation after we made the decision. The only reason we made the decision was on foot of his agreement. With the wisdom of hindsight, the centre in Blanchardstown was built and is one of the finest centres in Europe. Liffey Valley-Quarryvale is cheek and jowl and is successful. All the ballyhoo and controversy about these two centres turned out to be unnecessary. I hope these issues will be dealt with at the tribunal, not the Czech Republic and other distant places which I fail to see have relevance to the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, if we have heard a submission which was described by Deputy Lawlor as one of humility, I certainly would not like to see arrogance in this House. The only new information we heard this evening from Deputy Lawlor is that after a week in Mountjoy Prison he finally submitted 73 lever <Col N="94" /> arch files to the tribunal. I wonder how many more does he have, or will more time be spent in Mountjoy Prison to continue the drip-feed of information to the tribunal. Listening closely to what Deputy Lawlor said this evening, one can only be reminded that most of it is a rehash of what was put to the tribunal in the final days before the matter was referred to the High Court. It is worth reminding the House of the words of Mr. Justice Smyth in that regard when he said he was satisfied, and was finding as a fact, that on close reading and consideration of the evidence that was put before him, the application and the careful consideration of the submissions made on behalf of the parties, Deputy Lawlor was not only in contempt of court orders to discover and produce documents and to answer questions upon such documents, but was so in a most deliberate and most serious manner.</P>
      <P>I regret that in the course of the debate this evening Deputy Lawlor again availed of an opportunity, as he did in committee and outside the House on the public airwaves, to spread muck and create a smokescreen to hide his difficulties by attempting to involve the names of other Members of this House in a most appalling manner. I thought that in the course of his apology to the House, he might have availed of the opportunity to set the record straight in relation to his extraordinary and appalling outburst in committee some weeks ago. He speaks about the hounding at the hands of the tabloid press. If one is to look sympathetically at the plight of Deputy Lawlor, having read in the tabloid press some of the details of his exploits, one would have to put it to this House that by his actions on exiting Mountjoy Prison and heading straight for this House in the manner in which he did, he was merely fuelling the desires of the tabloid press and adding to a very high degree of cynicism among the public, which affects not only Deputy Lawlor but, regrettably and unfortunately, other Members of this House in an unfair manner.</P>
      <P>The amendments in the names of Fine Gael and Labour are worthy of support. It is disappointing the House must divide on this issue.</P>
      <P>I regret the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were most equivocal in their contributions. Late last year they were prepared, at the invitation of my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, to join in the signing of a letter which called upon Deputy Lawlor to co-operate with the tribunal. That was an unprecedented step. I would have thought that the least the House could do was draw up a joint statement or motion, on behalf of all party leaders, which would take a serious view of the events of recent weeks, events which directly involved a Member of the House in a manner that, in the history of the State, is without precedent. I regret the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have fallen short of appealing to Deputy Lawlor to take a certain course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste's contribution fell considerably short of statements she made prior to Deputy Lawlor's appearance before the courts. Deputy <Col N="95" /> Gormley posed a number of questions for the Tánaiste which, in light of her contribution, are worthy of a comprehensive reply on her part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gormley's party is okay; what he said was all right</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The judge described Deputy Lawlor's behaviour, as a Member of this House, as a scandal and a disgrace. The Tánaiste is on record as having said that &ldquo;Any representative of this House found to have acted in an improper manner should be required to resign their seat, whatever the implications for the stability and continuance of the Government.&rdquo;  The comments she made earlier fell considerably short of that. She refused to acknowledge the seriousness of the judge's comments, who, in reprimanding a Member of the House, used the words &ldquo;scandal&rdquo; and &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo;. She said that, at most, what she might encourage is the granting of scope to extend the rules. That falls considerably short of putting forward a view that improper conduct should render a person's membership of this House untenable.</P>
      <P>The amendments ask that a Deputy of the House should consider his position in a voluntary way. Everyone acknowledges, as the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste stated, that, as Members of the House, we are powerless, either collectively or individually, to impose a sanction on another Member. That is taken as given. However, on listening to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste one would form the view that we did not know that. I would have thought that the Government Members who contributed to the debate might, at least, have referred to an initiative they might embark upon to ensure that our rules, regulations, practices and procedures might be extended or expanded to allow us mark, in a united manner, the activities of a Member of the House with which we fundamentally disagree.</P>
      <P>There was no indication on the part of the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste, both of whom represent a majority grouping in the House and both of whom are heavily reliant on the vote of Deputy Lawlor to allow them to remain in office, that the rules would have to be changed. That is a serious lapse on the part of the majority party, Fianna Fáil, and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have one thing in common, namely, that they all referred to a constitutional barrier which they claim prevents the House from taking action of the type envisaged in the amendments tabled by Fine Gael and Labour. I do not believe that is the case. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are attempting to hide behind a constitutional barrier and Deputy Lawlor, not surprisingly, is attempting to use the same avenue. If such a constitutional barrier exists, why and how did the House manage to pass the Electoral Act, 1992, which sets out in clear terms the circumstances under which a Member of the Dáil might be dis<Col N="96" /> qualified. There is no reference in that Act to the fact that there is a constitutional barrier on same.</P>
    <P>Section 41 of the Act lists 12 instances where a Member may be disqualified. I wish to concentrate on just two of these which state that a Member may be disqualified where he or she is &ldquo;undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for any term exceeding six months, whether with or without hard labour, or of penal servitude for any period imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State&rdquo; or, in the alternative, where he or she &ldquo;is an undischarged bankrupt under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State, shall not be eligible for election as a member, or, subject to section 42(3), for membership of the Dáil.&rdquo;  The Act to which I refer was passed by the House not so long ago and on that occasion there did not appear to be the type of constitutional barrier about which we have heard so much from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that neither leader of the majority grouping in the House decided to put forward any suggestion regarding how a tightening of our regulations might be explored. For the benefit of the House, I constructively suggest to the majority Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, the group reliant on the support of Deputies Lawlor, Healy-Rae, Fox and other Independents to ensure its survival, that we should consider an amendment to section 41 of the Electoral Act. This amendment should include conviction for an offence committed under the terms of the Tribunal of Inquiries Acts, 1921 to 1998. If we want to take the route outlined by the Tánaiste &ndash; perhaps we might do more than she appears prepared to do &ndash; we might consider the creation of a new Standing Order which would lead to the automatic suspension of a Member from the Dáil when he or she receives a prison sentence and where a motion of suspension has been passed by the House, following a debate during which the relevant Member has been given an opportunity to contribute.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor and some persons writing in his defence have spoken in recent weeks about due process. I accept there should be due process. The Deputy availed of the opportunity to make his contribution to the debate, though I am not sure how far matters were advanced as a result.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to allowing the ethics committee to be requested to examine the returns made to the Public Offices Commission to ascertain whether Deputy Lawlor or other Members of the House have complied with the disclosure requirements. While the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil stated that their hands are tied by the Constitution when it comes to suspension or expulsion, it is worth bearing in mind that Ireland is one of only seven countries where an elected Member of the Assembly cannot be suspended or expelled by his colleagues. There are clear grounds for expulsion in many of these areas.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is going to <Col N="97" /> surprise us at the last moment &ndash; one can bet one's bottom dollar that he will not &ndash; what we have seen this evening is another example of the Government equivocating. We are not asking too much. All we request is that the Fine Gael and Labour amendments be accepted to show that the House can at least attempt to adopt a stance that might, in some way, alleviate the high level of public cynicism that has been visited upon it following the events of recent weeks. However, we will not get that. What we have got is a proposal from the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that will allow Fianna Fáil spend an additional £1 million in elections. No doubt it will collect that money from its friends in big business at a time when Ministers refer to the need to restore public confidence. Surely the restoration of public confidence is not a priority of this Government given its feeble motion before the House. I would have thought that on the first day of a new Dail session we might have at least put on the pretence of making a fresh start as far as the relationships between big business, politics, donations, money and sleaze are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy is as white as he would like us to believe, he can start to preach to this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed we have to debate this subject in the House. Speakers on all sides have noted that it is sad we have to devote valuable time to this subject which would have been unnecessary if Deputy Lawlor had co-operated fully with the Flood tribunal. I am pleased Deputy Lawlor was present to put his side of the case and that he apologised to the House. That should be recognised by all Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Justice Smyth pointed out, and it has been accepted by Deputy Lawlor, that there is a special <Col N="98" /> onus on elected Members of this House to respect and co-operate with the tribunal. That same onus applies equally to all Members. While it is sad matters have come to this, it is right that we take time to consider the activities of a fellow Member when those actions have been of such gravity.</P>
    <P>Some would argue we have been dealing with Deputy Lawlor's fitness to serve in this House and to represent the people who elected him. However, that is not the case. The kernel of this debate is whether it is appropriate for this House, which set up the tribunal of inquiry, to seek to extract a voluntary resignation from Deputy Lawlor on top of the action already taken by the tribunal and delivered through the High Court.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that Opposition amendments have been carefully constructed to suggest that Deputy Lawlor act voluntarily, it is important that we bear in mind the terms in which the High Court delivered its sentence. The court by its judgment sought to elicit Deputy Lawlor's full co-operation with the tribunal within a definite and definitive time frame. The judgment specifically acknowledged his membership of this House. It is important to underline this point which was mentioned by the Taoiseach in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>If the High Court was of the opinion Deputy Lawlor should resign his membership it was open to it to force him to do so through its sentence. Had the court chosen to hand down a decision which resulted in the Deputy undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding six months, then the provisions of the Electoral Act, 1992, would have rendered him ineligible to continue his membership of this House. However, it is also important to note the court chose not to do so. For that reason this House should not adopt a resolution which might suggest the High Court underestimated the seriousness of the error of Deputy Lawlor's ways. Nor should it suggest in any way that the High Court got it wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is untenable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear that the Opposition amendments, framed as they are, might suggest precisely that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's motion is specifically worded to take into account the High Court's decision and the care with which that decision was so obviously delivered. Our motion seeks to reinforce the main thrust of the High Court's sentence which is to guarantee Deputy Lawlor's full co-operation with the tribunal within a very specific and specified time frame. This is the only way to proceed. To proceed on the basis of the Opposition amendments would be to undermine the High Court's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one should suggest that I or the Government condone Deputy Lawlor's behaviour. As is clear from my comments and those of the Taoi<Col N="99" /> seach and the Tanaiste, we deplore the actions of any person who appears before the tribunal and does not fully co-operate with it. I was glad to hear Deputy Lawlor state that he fully accepts Mr. Justice Smyth's judgment and to hear him apologise to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a surprise that Deputy Lawlor accepts the judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>However, what is now needed is for Deputy Lawlor to give practical effect to the contrite statement he made in the House. He must comply with the terms of the High Court judgment and co-operate fully with the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud the tribunal for the work it is doing, the progress it has made and the vigour with which it is pursuing the truth. As the Taoiseach pointed out when he opened this debate, this Government established the Flood tribunal. We have been and remain unequivocally supportive of its work and will continue to support it through the remainder of its work. I respectfully suggest <Col N="100" /> that the focus of Members of the Opposition should be the same. Our overriding objective has to be to continue to be of assistance to the tribunal, to help it to get on with its work sifting the allegations and separating fact from fiction.</P>
    <P>In the cut and thrust of debate we should not forget a fundamental point. While the tribunal is proceeding with its work, nothing has been proven other than the fact Deputy Lawlor behaved in an unacceptable manner as a witness. We should leave the tribunals to get on with their work and make their findings so we in this House can act on findings and not accusations.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the conclusions reached by the tribunals and their getting to the heart of the matters being investigated, acting strongly and independently of this House. The tribunals would benefit from a little less interference from this House. All sides of this House and the country desire the truth and that is what this Government and its motion seek to facilitate. I commend the motion.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting the Taoiseach's insistence on building a National Stadium;</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting the rate of inflation in the construction industry and the likelihood that the project will cost at least IR£1 billion;</P>
      <P>calls on the Government to cease all work on the National Stadium with the exception of the aquatic centre and instead:</P>
      <P>(i) to redirect funding to assist and support the GAA and the FAI in completing Croke Park and Eircom Park respectively,</P>
      <P>(ii) to enter negotiations with the IRFU regarding funding for their Stadium Development Programme, and</P>
      <P>(iii) to redirect money to be spent on the National Stadium to the development of sporting infrastructure at regional, club, schools and community level in accordance with the Sporting Facilities Development Programme to be formulated by the Irish Sports Council in consultation with sporting and community organisations.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Clune, Deenihan, Ring and Perry.</P>
      <P>I am moving this motion because the proposal to build a national stadium as set out by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation can be described as the utmost folly. I will set out the reasons the Taoiseach and the Minister have got their priorities wrong. They are doing sport in Ireland a serious disservice by proceeding with a project that will be a major white elephant. What is supposed to be a field of dreams will turn into a nasty and expensive nightmare for the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach announced in January 1999 that the Government intended to build a national stadium at a cost of £281 million. Even that amount caused questions to be asked by leading sportsmen and sportswomen about the Taoiseach and his Government's priorities in relation to the development of sport in Ireland. They asked if professional and spectator sports were to be given priority over participatory sport as well as sport at club, local, community and regional levels. Many people were also puzzled by the sudden appear<Col N="103" /> ance of this major proposal since it was not in the programme for Government, drafted by the two Government parties, or its mid-term review.</P>
    <P>It was announced that the cost of the stadium would be £281 million but the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation established at its meeting on 14 September 2000 that this figure was a serious underestimation of the real cost. The promoters of the stadium had to quickly adjust their estimate from £281 million to £550 million. This revised figure of £550 is still a serious underestimation of the real cost of the stadium because it does not take a number of important factors into consideration.</P>
    <P>The first is that the Veterinary Research Laboratory and the Marine Institute must be relocated to make way for the stadium. The estimated cost of this relocation was £90 million in February 2000. However, in a reply to a parliamentary question in December 2000, it was conceded that the figure had increased alarmingly to £157 million. The second factor is that the estimated figure of £550 million did not include proposed road infrastructure costing approximately £20 million. The third factor is that it does not include the requirement to provide a fleet of buses to service the stadium from the city centre and other areas and to provide boarding facilities at an estimated cost of £20 million. The fourth factor is that it does include the provision of an athletics track which would cost an estimated £80 million if added. The Minister is shaking his head, but that cost is not included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>A separate track will be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is to be a national stadium, I assumed an athletics track would be included. There is an athletics track in Morton Stadium but the Taoiseach and the Minister said, when announcing the project, that it would be capable of attracting world and European athletic championships. A stadium without an athletics track will not have the facilities for such championships.</P>
      <P>The fifth factor is an escalation in building costs, which will be substantial between 1999 and 2003. If, as a conservative estimate, building costs increase by only 5% over the four years, one can understand by how much the cost of the project could increase. The sixth factor is that it does not include the value of the land at Abbotstown. This land is conservatively priced at between £100 million and £200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said during Question Time on 17 October 2000 that the cost of the stadium element of the project was, and is, £281 million. He continued that the feasibility study was based on that figure and all the examinations carried out by the advisory board were based on it. The 15,000 capacity multiple sports indoor arena, the medical centre, the administration block and other facilities were not covered by the £281 mill<Col N="104" /> ion. Therefore, one cannot make a comparison between the £281 million and the £550 million figures because they relate to different elements. The £281 million relates to the stadium only and the campus involves all the other initiatives. The original Price Waterhouse report was on the stadium alone and not any other element of the campus. The price in that report was £281 million and the additional elements bring the figure up to £550 million.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not point out that many of these facilities were already included in the overall estimated cost of £281 million. In answering questions in the House in October, the Taoiseach effectively misled the Dáil and the public. I understand that, in a personal statement this evening, the Taoiseach corrected the record. I have not seen the text of his statement so I cannot comment on it. However, the Taoiseach and the Government are wasting taxpayers' money and I hope somebody in Government will speak strongly to him and tell him it is a scandal to spend £1 billion on a personal dream.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party is delighted that the 50 metre swimming pool project is proceeding. The rainbow coalition Government undertook the bid for the Special Olympics and the 50 metre pool required for that event would have been built anyway. My party also supports the concept of office accommodation for national federations and welcomes the national sports medicine and training centre which should be developed in conjunction with the national coaching and training centre in Limerick, but not necessarily on the Abbotstown site.</P>
    <P>The proposed national stadium will be a monstrosity on the landscape at Abbotstown and may be a massive white elephant. We must at this stage ask who will use the stadium because it is being planned in a situation where, to date, there is no anchor tenant. Perhaps the Minister could address this aspect in his contribution. It is being built against a background where the GAA is proceeding with its magnificent redevelopment of Croke Park. This will cost the organisation and its clubs dearly unless the Government offers substantial financial aid because the project is running seriously over budget.</P>
    <P>The national stadium is also being developed in a situation where the FAI is developing an ultra modern stadium at Eircom Park. The initial cost of this project was £65 million, but the bill may be much more before the stadium is completed. The project is awaiting a decision from An Bord Pleanála on the appeal submitted by the Government through the Department of Defence. The FAI has been harassed and its progress has been impeded by the Government since it announced its plans for Eircom Park although the organisation has not sought funding from the Government and it is spending its own money. This contrasts sharply with the Taoiseach's stadium which will consume large amounts of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The development of the national stadium is also taking place at a time when the IRFU has <Col N="105" /> not yet disclosed its plans to either redevelop Lansdowne Road or build a new stadium on its land bank at Newlands Cross. The decision to build a national stadium was taken against a background where over 1,600 clubs applied in 2000 for capital grants to build facilities. Almost 1,000 of these clubs were refused funding despite the fact that many of them are still catering for young people in conditions where they must dress and undress at the sides of ditches and roads or in substandard or disused railway containers because of a lack of facilities. They are not getting money in many cases because the funding is spread so thinly on the ground. Clubs seeking £20,000 or £30,000 are not receiving that amount and some cannot proceed with projects. I am asking that the Government consider prioritising the development of a national sporting infrastructure rather than investing £1 billion in the Taoiseach's pet project.</P>
    <P>We should be making increased resources available for swimming pools. The Minister at the end of last year had a total of 51 proposals from local authorities under the swimming pool programme. Decisions at that time had been made only in the case of five proposals and there were 46 proposals from local authorities still in hand. Some 21 of these proposals related to refurbishment of existing swimming pools and the remaining 25 were to construct new pools. Of course these figures do not include applications from private groups who wish to build swimming pools in towns and cities around the country.</P>
    <P>The figures provided by the Minister's Department in response to parliamentary questions in late 2000 show the scale of need within the sporting communities in that the estimated cost of projects which applied for grant aid was £857 million and the estimated allocation was £36 million. The estimated value of unsuccessful projects was £745 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister in a statement in the House during Question Time on one occasion made a childish argument, that he provided more in one year than I, as Minister, provided in three years. I submit that we are not comparing like with like. In 1994 the funding of sporting organisations was done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The first priority for any responsible person was to put in place a national plan for sport because the only way one would get sufficient funding to meet the needs of sporting organisations from the Department of Finance was to put in place a national strategy. I compared it to the businessman who goes to the banker for a loan for a business. Unless a business plan is in place the funding will not be forthcoming from the bank. Likewise, a Minister without a business plan for sport could not expect to get Exchequer funding for sports projects.</P>
    <P>The national plan for sport advocated dramatically increased funding for sport at all levels but with greater emphasis on participatory <Col N="106" /> sport because it acknowledged that sport is the greatest preventative element in the fight against crime and drugs. The then Taoiseach recognised that and set up the ministerial task force on drugs. One key recommendation of that task force was the use of sport and recreation as a preventative element in the fight against crime and drugs. It laid heavy emphasis on a preventative programme in one of the 11 pilot projects. The point I am making is that the priority at the time was to get a national plan for sport in place. The plan advocated a dramatic increase in funding as well as the appointment of a serious Minister at Cabinet level. I acknowledge that the Taoiseach implemented both of those key recommendations to a degree, appointing a senior Minister. However, where he went wrong was that he ignored one of the key provisions of that plan, that priority should be given to participatory sport, to involving young people at all levels of sport, irrespective of the role they play. The principle was that if you get them involved in sport, you will keep them away from the negative influences of crime and drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister's criticism of the previous Government, and particularly of me, was childish. He engaged in one-upmanship. We were not comparing like with like. I do not care to hear that argument here this evening because the figures for sporting projects to which I referred earlier speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Despite the level of demand for funding for sporting projects throughout the country and despite the fact that the majority of schools do not have sports halls, the Taoiseach and the sports Minister are preparing to spend up to, or perhaps more than, £1 billion on a project which to this day does not have an anchor tenant. To my knowledge, no contract or legally binding arrangements have been put in place regarding tenancy of the stadium. I would ask anybody interested to read the proceedings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation of 14 September last to see the feather-brained aspirations regarding who would use the stadium. We are told the GAA will commit itself to major events there. What major GAA events would attract 80,000 people to the national stadium? I ask the Minister to stop trying to kill the Eircom Park project to justify this national stadium. Will he explain exactly what is happening in regard to this project?</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Government to cease all work on the national stadium, with the exception of the aquatic centre, and instead redirect funding to assist and support the GAA and the FAI in completing Croke Park and Eircom Park respectively. Why does the Minister not call in those three major organisations and ask them to discuss the provision of model stadia in this city and country? What happened last Sunday in Limerick <Col N="107" /> was regrettable. Trying to get the people who wished to go to the rugby match into the stadium with a capacity of 13,000 was akin to putting a gallon into a pint bottle, while there was a stadium with a capacity of 55,000 lying idle perhaps half a mile away.</P>
    <P>The major sporting organisations must come together in a sensible way. We have religions sharing facilities but we cannot get our sporting groups to agree to share facilities. They have a responsibility. While acknowledging the right of any organisation to protect its property and investments, sport should cross over all boundaries. The fact that I could not get a ticket has nothing to do with it, but last Tuesday morning genuine supporters queued in rain, wind and cold to try to get tickets for the big event last Sunday.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be a leader in sport and get those organisations together to discuss the issues related to the provision of major facilities and other attendant issues. He should make clear that if some agreement can be reached, the Exchequer is prepared to fund projects.</P>
    <P>The provision of £50 million to Croke Park would get the GAA over the major hump. All the controversy about Eircom Park, provided it gets over planning objection by the Department of Defence, could be eliminated if the Government showed its commitment to the FAI in the development of that stadium in the manner in which it has showed its commitment to other sports. The Minister will talk about the development of the League of Ireland and other facilities for young people, but in the case of major stadia in particular, the bullet should be bitten by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If Eircom Park with a capacity for 45,000 goes ahead and if Croke Park is completed to the standard to which the GAA is aspiring, there will be two magnificent projects in this city which will be a credit to two magnificent organisations and to sport.</P>

The resources that would be freed would transform sporting infrastructure and we would bring sport from 19th century standards that, to our shame, still exist into the 21st century. It could be done with a bit of courage and a little vision.</P>
      <P>I have not spoken here tonight about the vested interests involved in sport and the way in which they control and manipulate sport and people who are speaking about national stadiums who have vested interests. I have not spoken about that and I do not want to go into personalities. The argument is sufficiently strong on its own to win the support of this House and the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak in support of the motion my colleague, Deputy Allen, has brought forward tonight, on the aspect of the motion that focuses on transferring funds nationally to channel funds to be spent on the development of sporting infrastructure at regional, club, schools and community level, as the motion states, in accordance with the sporting facilities development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important we recognise that, across the <Col N="109" /> country, sporting facilities are under-funded. As Deputy Allen pointed out, in figures I was not aware of but which are startling, £857 million worth of funding was applied for and only £36 million was provided. That, in itself, indicates that there is a deficit throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We are well aware that the sporting &ndash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>If they cannot spend £36 million how are they going to spend £857 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I know many clubs in my constituency that are looking for pitches, renting pitches, have no secure pitches of their own and are transferring children across the city to pitches outside their area. As regards the voluntary sector involved in sporting facilities, particularly on a Saturday morning, they do not have enough facilities and, since they cannot guarantee pitches and matches, training sessions have to be cancelled.</P>
      <P>The value of sport and of providing children and young people with an alternative, with a hobby, and keeping them off the streets, is important. The value of physical training, mixing with other children and of companionship is important. The discipline of turning up on a Saturday morning or a Wednesday night for training is also important. All these values cannot be underestimated.</P>
      <P>I had a letter today from young people in my constituency who had done a survey in their school. The one thing they criticised, and that they agreed to pass on to all their public representatives, was the lack of sporting facilities in their community, the lack of a sports hall, of pitches, of public tennis courts, etc. You can join a private tennis club or a local private leisure centre attached to a hotel at £1,000 per family per year but there is no public swimming pool, nowhere they can go to pay £2.50 or £3 and know it will be there for them at set times. These are facilities that are lacking throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I have asked questions in relation to the swimming pool programme and there is only £45 million allocated over three years for that &ndash; £15 million a year. We are trying to introduce a proposal in the Cork Corporation area to redevelop a swimming pool but we are told it will cost £6 million, £3 million of which is not even guaranteed as funding forthcoming from the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>That shows that the sports programme has been hyped out of all perspective. There is not enough funding provided in the programme to match the requirements nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> If we are serious about developing sporting facilities across the country the national stadium, as promoted and supported strongly by the Taoiseach, is not the answer to that problem. The answer is to spread the money throughout the country, to give it to local clubs and facilities to develop sporting facilities locally.</P>
    <P>I have never played any of these sports. I am not a follower of sports, though I attend major finals, but that is its value to most people; they go once a year or twice a year, if even then, if they can get tickets. What my colleague, Deputy Allen, has outlined is true. Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork was not in use the weekend before last while people could not get to see the Munster rugby match. The same was true of Thomond Park in Limerick last week.</P>

      <P>We had no Munster final last year; this meant that Páirc Uí Chaoimh has not been used at all. It is just there. This is a disgrace. There must be some way these organisations can get together to open up facilities so that they are available to all to use. It is important that we pay tribute to the voluntary work that has been done.</P>
      <P>Looking at the figures Deputy Allen has provided in relation to the cost of the national stadium, when we add the extras that have not been taken into account &ndash; the development of infrastructure to the stadium, the development of rail and bus services and the cost escalation &ndash; the cost of construction is escalating enormously. If one speaks to builders across the country, one will learn that, as regards any construction job, the price will have increased by 20% by the time this project is completed. That is true of most projects now due to the cost of construction and we have not seen the half of it yet. This is a scandal.</P>
      <P>We should first concentrate on developing and building up sporting structures across the country and encouraging young people to become involved in sports. Then let us look at our stadiums if we need them nationally. They are not of relevance to the ordinary individual who is, day in and day out, trying to encourage young people to get involved in sports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. If nothing else it allows us to have a discussion on sport, which we rarely have. For such an important part of Irish society, sport should be discussed at least once a year in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right for any Opposition to ask questions. That is the job of an opposition in any democracy. It should not be blamed for asking pertinent questions about costs to the taxpayer. That is what we are doing here. We are here to protect the taxpayer and that is why we must be forever vigilant as regards how taxpayers' money is spent. I compliment Deputy Allen for pursuing his cam<Col N="111" /> paign against the national sports centre when one considers the amount of taxpayers' money that is going to be spent.</P>
    <P>I must clarify my position. In 1988 I wrote an article for the <i>Irish Independent</i> and in it I proposed everything in the Minister's proposal. I was spokesperson on sport at the time and it was my vision for a national stadium. I went further than the Minister's proposal in that I suggested the complex should include a 50 metre pool, a sportshouse, a national museum of sport, a national injury rehabilitation centre as well as a national stadium which would encompass all sports. I cannot say I am completely opposed to the Minister's proposals. What must take place is a rational and reasoned debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>The GAA must clarify its position. I am still actively involved in the GAA. I still coach football teams such as the divisional team in north Kerry. I am a GAA man and am still involved with my club. The people in Croke Park, who at times operate at a distance from the level at which I operate within the organisation, must clarify soon whether they will allow soccer or rugby to be played in Croke Park. If the Government proceeds with its plans, which it will as long as the Minister is around because he is very committed to, focused on and wishes to proceed with this project, it can legitimately say that the GAA gave it no indication that, in five years' time, it would not decide that, to pay its maintenance costs, it would be profitable for it to offer Croke Park to rugby or soccer. The GAA must come clean and clarify its position.</P>
    <P>The IRFU must do likewise. It is delighted to co-operate because it will receive the use of a free stadium. It is paying its players massive amounts of money at present and is finding it very tough to survive. How much will it bring or how much money will it spend on the new stadium? If I were in charge of the IRFU, I would be delighted to co-operate and use the facilities, but how much will it invest in the stadium? The Lansdowne Road site is worth a fortune and its other land out in Newlands Cross or wherever is worth a great deal of money. The IRFU must give a commitment as to what it will invest in the stadium initially and in its maintenance.</P>
    <P>The FAI should have had a stadium many years ago. Unlike the GAA which, in fairness, invested its money in facilities, I do not know what the FAI did with its money. It certainly did not provide any facilities. There is not one dressing room in Kerry soccer. Soccer players in Kerry still tog out on the side of a ditch or out of the boots of their cars. That is a scandal. The FAI has no regard for the small clubs in Kerry and throughout the country. The organisation is completely centralised. I am sure Pat Hickey would feel at home in it at times. It has provided nothing whereas it should have provided a stadium. It has <Col N="112" /> a proposal for one now and it should state whether it will proceed with it. Some of the organisation's members do not want it and oppose it while others are more than enthusiastic about it. It will have to decide rapidly. If Eircom Park proceeds, I do not see how the Minister can proceed with the national stadium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is similar to a situation where three into two must go. While the national stadium will be the shining jewel, the foundations of sport are also very important. It is to be hoped the huge cost of the project will not blind the Government to the real need for a new and much more comprehensive programme for sport at community level. Facilities in deprived urban areas are like those from early in the previous century.</P>
      <P>Building a new stadium is a very ambitious plan. However, we should take note of the Dome experience in London on which £1 billion was spent. We should be extremely careful given the budget overrun in that case. It is correct that we should question the Government's sums for outlay and investment in the stadium. The Dome was an embarrassment for the British Government. It is possible an Irish man will buy it for £185 million to £200 million where it cost the British Exchequer £1 billion. We must be very careful about the direction we take.</P>
      <P>Relocation of the State agencies on site, such as the State Laboratory, will cost £100 million. That is a huge cost. The site in question is more than 400 acres. Will the Minister clarify if it is necessary for these buildings to be relocated, some, I understand, to the constituency of the Minister of Finance, Deputy McCreevy, at a cost of £100 million? These agencies perform very important public functions. I understand a massive rebuilding programme costing £3 million is nearing completion at the State Laboratory. It must be asked why these buildings are being demolished and the offices being relocated.</P>
      <P>It is a pity an accommodation was not reached with the GAA about the use of Croke Park. It scarcely represents good housekeeping for the State to award £20 million to support Croke Park only to proceed with plans for another 80,000 seater stadium. That money should have been given conditionally given that Croke Park is idle for a good part of the year. It is regrettable that was not done because it could be made ready for rugby at this time of the year.</P>
      <P>Ireland has fewer than 4 million people and the economies of scale are considerably less than in the UK. What is happening with the various stadium plans at present is like a duplication of businesses. Common sense and good business practices must prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a rethink of the plan and I compliment Deputy Allen on calling for a moratorium on the national stadium project until the <Col N="113" /> Committee of Public Accounts has conducted a full, open and independent review. It is important that that be conducted regardless of who invests money. Mr. McManus will invest £50 million but that could be the most expensive £50 million we ever received. Given the scale and magnitude of this project, the Minister will feel easier in years to come if there is an independent review of this plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>A review should be conducted by the Committee of Public Accounts which represents all vested interests in the House. The Minister wants to spend £1 billion. The foundations of sport are in the community. While the Minister has increased funding in sport, and Deputy Allen alluded to this, it has not been to the degree necessary. We are talking about a situation where three into two must go. We cannot have three stadia in Dublin, all of them catering for the marketplace. There must be a comprehensive plan. Certain aspects of the Campus Ireland project are needed, such as the 50 metre swimming pool, but an independent study of it would clearly establish the direction we should take.</P>
      <P>While it did not deal directly with sport, the Dome in London is the best example. There was a massive fanfare at its opening, yet £1 billion was lost on it. That should be a warning. We do not have the Exchequer resources of the British state. The Dome was an embarrassment of which the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, was delighted to wash his hands and shut down at a huge loss. The national stadium project will involve massive relocation and investment while people at the foundations of sport are crying out for resources.</P>
      <P>We have a facility at Sligo Rovers on which £500,000 could be spent to make it a vibrant club. The want of a small amount of funds may mark its death-knell. Granted, the Minister provided some funds, but not near enough. The project warranted much greater investment to ensure its viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is a need for a stadium, the Minister should build from the bottom. In this context one must question the co-operation received from the FAI, the GAA and the rugby authorities. All those investing in sport should sit around the table to present a plan to comprehensively meet the needs identified in the context of a national stadium. Competition is the lifeblood <Col N="114" /> of trade and business. It is regrettable that vested interests are operating in the sports arena. Common sense must prevail. There is a great slogan in business: timber surfaces in water. When this matter is fully analysed, clearly much will surface in water.</P>

      <P>The subject matter of the Private Members' motion introduced by Deputy Allen provides yet another opportunity to answer the hoary old question so often posed by students of politics. What is the difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael? The attitude of the Fine Gael leadership to the campus and stadium project highlights one major difference. Fine Gael's approach, as expressed by Deputy Allen, is timid, parochial and devoid of all vision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil approach and that of our partners in government is forward-looking and ambitious, reflecting confidence in the capacity of this country to embark on a major undertaking which will, over time, bring immense benefit to the people and national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid Deputy Allen does not understand the nature of what is envisaged for Sports Campus Ireland. We are not simply building a football pitch. We are creating a state-of-the-art complex of sports facilities worthy of a successful and progressive modern European nation. In addition, we are putting in place a sports infrastructure which will enable us to bid for, credibly, and host major international sports events which at present are beyond our reach. Deputy Allen of all people knows well that substantial investment in golfing facilities during the past decade has enabled us to become a mecca for golfing tourists and to bid successfully for the Ryder Cup. Sports <Col N="115" /> Campus Ireland will, in time, attract comparable major international events.</P>
    <P>It is just over one year since the Taoiseach first announced the Government's decision to develop Sports Campus Ireland at Abbotstown, County Dublin, on a site already in State ownership. This decision, which marked an increasing maturity and professionalism, in the best sense of the word, in Irish sport, reflected the Government's determination to provide the very best of facilities for all levels of participation and competition, from local facilities for community use right up to the world class facility which Sports Campus Ireland, with its 80,000 seat national stadium centrepiece capable of accommodating all field sports, will represent.</P>
    <P>Before I outline the progress made during the past 12 months in advancing the project, I will recall those commentators who at the time of the recent Sydney Olympic Games marvelled at the wonderful facilities and structures provided by the Australian authorities to accommodate the games and bemoaned the lack of similar facilities here. Each time the World Cup, world championships and Olympic Games are held, the lack of such facilities here is highlighted and we are castigated by the media and other commentators because of it. Yet, now when we try to proceed to build such facilities, we get a different response. I say to those critics that Sports Campus Ireland will include a stadium of which the people can be proud and which can compete with any stadium worldwide for international events. To those who are less than supportive of the steps the Government is taking to remedy these shortcomings, I say that a great stadium will contribute much to our national prestige and sense of national pride and the existence of a world class stadium accessible to all will act as a catalyst for the development of sport. The concept of Sports Campus Ireland is rooted in the belief that strategic investment made today will realise significant benefits for future generations.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, a development company, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, has been established as a special purpose company under the chairmanship of Mr. Paddy Teahon, former Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, and comprises representatives of the sports and business sectors to undertake and oversee the entire project. CSID met for the first time on 29 March last when it was addressed by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and me.</P>
    <P>The executive services team provides a full range of executive, property, financial, management, planning, environmental and communications services for the company. The team to which the executive services contract was awarded is headed by Magahy and Company Limited, and comprises PricewaterhouseCoopers, <Col N="116" /> Wilson Hartnell Public Relations, McHugh Consultants, Thorbourn Colquhoun, Sheamus Monaghan and Partners and Mr. Ronnie Delaney. The Office of Public Works is providing the project management function for the infrastructure of the campus and stadium and has established a dedicated unit for that purpose.</P>
    <P>One of the first tasks of CSID was to examine the feasibility of providing some of the infrastructure for the Special Olympics in 2003. Because of the research already undertaken in the course of the original feasibility study and data compiled on the original campus, CSID asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake a further phase of the feasibility exercise for the sports campus which follows on from and builds on its earlier work. In particular, PricewaterhouseCoopers was asked to consider an aquatic centre incorporating a 50 metre swimming pool, diving pool, two training pools, plus related infrastructure, to be available for the Special Olympics in 2003.</P>
    <P>Government approval to proceed with the development of an aquatic and leisure centre at the Sports Campus Ireland site was given in July last and the project went to tender on the basis of a public-private partnership offering a contract for the design, build, operation, maintaining and financing of the centre. CSID is happy to report that the response to the competition is extremely positive. Meanwhile, I understand that an application for planning permission in respect of this element of the project was lodged just before Christmas. In putting the various facilities to public tender, CSID decided to establish the potential for completing as much of the project as possible on a public-private partnership basis, minimising the requirement for State investment.</P>
    <P>The tendering process is under way for the other facilities envisaged for the Campus Stadium Ireland site. These include the stadium, the indoor arena, the indoor and outdoor training halls and pitches, the sports science and medical centre, the headquarters for sports organisations, specific sports facilities decided on the advice of the Irish Sports Council and the visitor information centre. The first stage of this process closed earlier this month and proposals are now being assessed with a view to issuing invitations for the second stage as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>CSID also held a competition to develop an architectural and environmental framework plan for the entire site of 500 acres. The winning framework plan will suggest a logical and coherent approach to accommodating Sports Campus Ireland, a major parkland amenity to serve the community and general public, a major science/educational project to be selected and complementary commercial and leisure projects with respect to the built and natural heritage that exists at Abbotstown. This competition is being managed by the Royal Association of Architects in Ireland in association with CSID. The winning <Col N="117" /> framework plan will suggest access and transport solutions to the site as well as an overall policy approach to the quality of the architecture that will be expected for this important site. It is intended that the winning team of architects will develop a detailed development control plan for the site and will act as consultants to Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited throughout the duration of the project.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in order to ensure high quality architecture in the buildings on site, CSID is establishing, using normal tender procedures, a panel of architects from which the providers of facilities may be required to source their architectural input. Applications under this competition are currently being assessed. Finally, CSID expects to place an advertisement shortly in respect of the commercial elements of the campus. This will relate to the provision of hotels and complementary commercial facilities on the site.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the feasibility study undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the 1999 research which effectively informed the Government's decision to develop a national stadium and sports campus. That report identified a figure of £281 million, which was made up of £230 million for Stadium Ireland and an initial guideline cost of £51 million for a campus of sporting excellence. As Paddy Teahon has pointed out, the stadium cost has not changed &ndash; it remains at £230 million. However, on the basis of further work by PricewaterhouseCoopers and professional estimates for the commercial facilities planned, the cost of the campus, excluding the stadium, is £320 million. This gives a total cost of £550 million for the entire campus and stadium project.</P>
    <P>CSID believes that the private sector will be prepared to invest £150 million in the project, mostly for commercial facilities. That is a conservative estimate. When the private donation of £50 million is taken into account, this leaves £350 million to be invested by the Exchequer in Sports Campus Ireland, including Stadium Ireland. Over the past weeks and months I have heard that figure go from £300 million through to £400 million, then £500 million, £600 million, £750 million and £800 million. For some reason the sum of £900 million was left out before the figure of £1 billion was quoted. This week I read that the figure is £1.2 billion.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer is estimated at £350 million. Members will appreciate that we will not be in a position to move from &ldquo;best estimates&rdquo; until the tender competitions have been completed, around the middle of this year, and the value of the contracts is known.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government and I, as Minister with responsibility since 1 January last for overseeing the Sports Campus Ireland project, will do everything in our power to ensure that stringent control is maintained over the costs of the project. In this regard, particular importance <Col N="118" /> is attached to adherence to the Department of Finance guidelines and procedures for capital projects. Project management structures are already in place in the development company and in the Office of Public Works. These will be reviewed, as necessary, by my Department.</P>
    <P>In carrying out its role in ensuring the proper planning and management of the Sports Campus Ireland project, the company will have the support of the project steering group set up last year under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach. This group, now chaired by my Department, provides a mechanism for co-ordination between interested Departments and offices, including CSID, and provides oversight of the development of the project.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed with the provision of Sports Campus Ireland is a logical progression from and complements the contribution of this Government to the development of sport over the past three and a half years. It can readily be seen that those countries throughout the world with a well developed, successful and progressive sports sector ensure that a holistic and cohesive approach is in place. Contrast this with what appears to be proposed by the Opposition motion. Deputy Allen is suggesting that the Government should fund the building of three stadia for each of the leading sports and have no national stadium. Surely the Deputy cannot be serious.</P>

      <P>I trust the time will be added on. Let me deal with the accusation that funding for local and community facilities is being redirected to fund Sports Campus Ireland. I wish to nail this argument once and for all. It is not an either/or situation. Since this Government took office in 1997, I have allocated £62 million to sporting organisations and community groups throughout the country with particular emphasis on areas of disadvantage. This contrasts with allocations to the value of £18 million in the previous three <Col N="119" /> years. In one year this Government has provided more money to those organisations than Deputy Allen did in his three years in office.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Last year, for example, I met a cross party group to discuss plans for the development of sporting facilities run by the Oblate Fathers in Inchicore. We delivered the money and we have done everything possible to facilitate the early drawdown of the money. I will continue to listen to whatever representations are made by Members of this House and the Government will continue to deliver as it has done over the last three years.</P>
      <P>The money is not necessarily the problem in this area &ndash; it is getting the money spent. Over the last two years I have listened to representations by Deputies and others and prioritised as much as possible to the organisations. They all promised that their facilities would be finished within a particular timeframe but we are currently only finishing 70% to 75% of those projects. If we cannot spend the £51 million that was made available last year, how are we to spend between £300 million and £500 million? We cannot get contractors and development to spend the £51 million.</P>

      <P>We want to take all of the abstract plans sitting on secretaries' desks throughout the country and turn them into three dimensional bricks and mortar. Unfortunately, not through any fault of the governing bodies, we are unable to spend all of the allocated funding in a one year period. If we cannot spend £51 million, how are we to spend £351 million? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the highlights in the development and implementation of sports policy during 2000 was the launching of a statement of strategy by the Irish Sports Council entitled &ldquo;A New Era for Irish Sport&rdquo;. The strategy charts the priorities of the council for the next three years. The Government committed itself in the budget to doubling the annual grant to the council from £10 million to £20 million. To achieve this target, an additional £2.5 million was provided for 2001 with further commitments to increases of the order of £5 million in 2002, £7.5 million in 2003 and £10 million in 2004. Following the Sydney Olympics, I met all of the Olympic participants who informed me that they required additional fund<Col N="120" /> ing. That funding has now been provided. I was assured that if such funding was provided, the athletes would present me with bags of gold following the games in Athens.</P>
    <P>The budget also provided a sum of £2.5 million towards the provision of opportunities for young people to participate in hurling, football, soccer and rugby. The £2.5 million will be distributed by the Irish Sports Council with £1 million each being provided to the GAA and FAI and £500,000 to the IRFU, specifically to attract more young people into these sports. In addition, a further allocation of £500,000 has been provided to encourage and promote greater participation in recreational sport and activities by older people, something not contemplated by any previous Administration. Under the international carding scheme, grants in excess of £1.1 million were awarded in 2000 to 236 players and athletes representing 24 sports.</P>
    <P>The building of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool at the University of Limerick is ongoing with a target opening date of mid-2001. Government funding of £5.95 million was provided towards the building costs of the facility, in addition to an annual subvention of £195,000 per annum towards the running costs. I am also pleased to announce the increased provision of £45 million for local authority swimming pool programmes. The rainbow coalition provided total funding of only £3 million in this area. The increased funding provides local authorities an enhanced opportunity to submit proposals for the refurbishment of existing pools and the construction of new ones. Some 50 proposals were received by the closing date of 31 July 2000. During 2000, a revised funding mechanism was put in place which resulted in a grant of up to £3 million being made available for the renovation of existing pools or the construction of new ones. These local authorities can now obtain a grant of £3 million &ndash; the total amount of funding provided annually by the rainbow coalition &ndash; for one pool which they wish to refurbish.</P>
    <P>In the area of local development, grants to the value of £36 million were allocated to some 679 clubs and organisations under the sports capital programme during 2000. This allocation included a sum of £25.7 million for community and voluntary groups throughout the country towards the provision of local sport and recreational facilities. Those local organisations have found it impossible to draw down that amount of money because there are not sufficient contractors and developers to complete the projects. How, then, would it be possible to draw down an increased amount of funding?</P>

      <P>A sum of £4.8 million was awarded towards the provision of a national indoor athletic training facility at Morton Stadium, Santry, to complement the existing outdoor athletics stadium. Included in this project will be a new headquarters for the unified national athletics body for Ireland, the Athletics Association of Ireland. I also awarded £500,000 towards the development of Ringsend Stadium, Dublin, as an athletic and football facility and a total of £2.35 million was allocated to a range of county GAA and FAI grounds throughout the country. I have facilitated eight League of Ireland clubs and 15 county grounds to date and it is my intention to provide State aid to all 26 county grounds and League of Ireland clubs before the end of this Administration. I look forward to a favourable response to this year's programme and to the opportunity to further assist sports organisations and local community groups and clubs through the provision of much needed facilities in every corner of the country. There was a reference to sports people having to tog out in ditches etc. throughout the country. That is not happening.</P>

      <P>I accept there may be particular areas which deserve priority and that priority will be accorded. Some 96% of the applications I am currently receiving relate to the improvement of facilities. I am not including in those figures local pub teams which receive a set of jerseys from the publican as I am aware that some of those teams do not have facilities. I compliment Deputy Allen because, between the two of us, Cork has received more than £6 million in recent years. I do not understand where Deputy Clune was coming from because Cork has received the second largest allocation in the country.</P>
      <P>It is only proper that Irish sports people and athletes, who are benefiting from the improved facilities currently available or under construction through supports and services provided by the State, should have a world class stage in their own country on which they can compete with world class peers and showcase their skills and prowess.</P>

      <P>CSID has conducted discussions, in conjunction with the Irish Sports Council, with a wide range of individual NGBs. These dis<Col N="122" /> cussions have informed the tendering process being pursued by CSID in relation to the facilities which will be put in place in Sports Campus Ireland. In regard to the pool, for example, both Swim Ireland and Special Olympics Ireland have made a significant contribution to the process. All of these initiatives are taking place in consultation with the community groups in the area for whom Sports Campus Ireland will be a tremendous facility. It is vital to maintain communication with local communities.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, and I am sure the House will agree, that under this Government an ambitious programme of State-assisted expansion is under way in a wide range of sports facilities and support services, catering for both élite participants and the general public throughout the country. On one occasion, speaking in a political context, Parnell said that no one should set a boundary to the march of a nation. Those in the Fine Gael Party who oppose this project are very unwisely setting a boundary to progress and narrowing our horizons. Despite the names formally appended to the motion, the negative attitude expressed by Deputy Allen does not, I hope, reflect the views of all Fine Gael Deputies. They will obey the whip but quite a few will do so reluctantly. Many of them know in their hearts that this is a long-term project envisaged to serve the needs and opportunities of the country, not in 2003 or 2005 but in 2053 and 2055.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht tábhtachtach seo and molaim an Teachta Allen as ucht an rúin a chur os comhair na Dála. I wish to share time tonight with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin and tomorrow night with Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      <P>There is one common factor between the proposed national stadium, the proposed Eircom Park and the redevelopment of Croke Park, namely, the cost overrun. In regards the national stadium and Eircom Park, there is not alone increasing cost but also serious division. At this stage the public and especially the sporting public are both confused and concerned. It is incumbent on each of us in the House, amid all this confusion and concern, to focus on what is best for sport in Ireland in a balanced way, having regard to all available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October the Taoiseach announced that responsibility for the Sports Campus Ireland project would be transferred from his Department to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation with effect from 1 January 2001. In the document produced by the Department of Sport when Deputy Allen was Minister, &ldquo;Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland: Sport in Ireland 1997 to 2006 and Beyond&rdquo;, the core prin<Col N="123" /> ciples of the sports strategy are outlined. It would serve all participating in this debate well to reflect on these core principles when we consider the deepening controversy regarding what most observers see as the over-provision of stadia in the greater Dublin area, a provision which in terms of scarce resources which have alternative uses, is unjustifiable. Indeed, there is great anger among a significant number of citizens who see this level of sporting investment in stadia as obscene against the non-provision of urgently needed health and hospital facilities.</P>
    <P>I intend to present the core principles of the sports strategy to the House and to examine the Sports Campus Ireland project and the other projects in that context. The first principle is a people centred focus. Sport provision should place the needs, choices and abilities of participants at its central focus. The second principle is equality. Every Irish person, regardless of gender, age or ability, should have equal rights to participate in sport. The third principle is partnership. The development of sport depends on quality partnerships between the sports sector, public authorities, the private sector, individuals and organisations. The next principle is quality. The achievement of quality in sport requires the promotion and attainment of high standards at all levels, including participation, leadership, education, training, planning and management of sports facilities and support systems. The next principle is accountability. The full development of sport in Ireland demands the achievement of the optimum benefit from available resources. Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of deployed resources is necessary if this is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The first question that needs to be addressed is why the Sports Campus Ireland project should, since its inception until the end of last year, have been within the responsibility of the Department of the Taoiseach. Following from that question is whether the core principles of the sports strategy were used as benchmarks for the project. I wish to clearly state the position of the Labour Party regarding the Sports Campus Ireland project. We support the campus of sporting excellence element of the project, but obviously we will require detailed explanations why, in less than 12 months, the estimated cost has rocketed from a guideline £51 million to £320 million. There is an indicative amount of £150 million from private investment and I take it from what the Minister has said that this will relate only to the campus of sporting excellence. I ask him to clarify this.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has real concerns with the national stadium element of Sports Campus Ireland. I stated those concerns on Wednesday, 26 January 2000, the day the feasibility study was launched, as follows.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> We have long lamented the absence of an international quality major sports stadium in Dublin. With the GAA continuing with the development of Croke Park, the FAI committed to proceeding with its plans for the Eircom stadium and the Taoiseach insisting today that the Government intends to go ahead with its proposals for an 80,000 seater stadium in Abbotstown, there is now a real danger of unnecessary duplication and waste of money. It is very unlikely that there will be sufficient major sporting events to ensure viability for all these projects and there is every possibility that at least one of them will turn out to be a sporting white elephant.</P>
    <P>The scene has been changing with bewildering speed since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>No, let me give the Minister the facts. Little if anything has happened in the interim to allay our fears. I will list some of our concerns. There is an estimated 23% inflation in the construction industry, but in a recent newspaper article Mr. Paddy Teahon, chairman of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, appears to be standing over the figure of £320 million for the national stadium, the figure in the Pricewaterhouse report. Yet in the same feasibility study under the heading construction costs the following is stated in relation to the American economist, Richard Baim:</P>
      <P>. . . assessed the extent to which the cost of stadium projects exceeded their budgets. Of 15 stadia surveyed, the average budget overshoot was 73.4%. The evidence presented in table 8.2(d) suggests that early estimates are poor indicators of the final cost of a stadium. This is an important issue in considering the economic impact of the proposed Irish national stadium.</P>
      <P>This is not from the media but from the report commissioned by the Government which we were told was an independent report. If we apply the 73.4% average overrun to the national stadium projects, the cost will come out at almost £400 million. I suggest an overrun of 73.4% against the background of an estimated 23% inflation in construction is extremely conservative. If we calculate the overrun to date on the campus of excellence project based on the £51 million guideline estimate and the more recent £320 million estimate, the figure we get is 527%. Even accepting that the aquatic centre, at an estimated cost of £15 million to £20 million, was added after the 26 January 2000 announcement, the increase in estimate is, to say the least, staggering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ancillary infrastructure and site clearance costs have also increased in substantial fashion. The cost of relocating the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the <Col N="125" /> Marine Institute laboratories increased in the latter part of 2000 from £90 million to £157 million, an increase of 70%. To my knowledge, we do not have reliable estimates of the costs of the roadworks and the proposed new station to the site. I put it to the Minister that it is very difficult, based on all I have outlined, to have confidence in regard to the £550 million estimate for the Sports Campus Ireland project.</P>
    <P>There is concern about a serious overrun on the redevelopment of Croke Park. Some estimates put the overrun as high as 60%. There is a reported increase in the estimated cost of Eircom Park in the order of 66%. The IRFU is the only one of the three major sporting organisations which indicated to the consultancy team that if a national stadium is constructed, it would play its international matches in such a facility, subject to agreement on terms and conditions. While the GAA does not have international matches in the accepted sense, in regard to the feasibility study one could hardly describe the reported comments of the GAA as committing both organisations to intensive use of the national stadium. The Labour Party remains fully committed to an international quality major sports stadium appropriate to the national need.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain the background to our amendment. My concern and the concern of the Labour Party is that we are facing duplication and waste of taxpayers' money. If the Minister takes the percentage I gave him, the figures being presented from his side of the House are no longer credible.</P>

That is my concern. We should get somebody to independently examine our resources and our needs and tell us what we should do to maximise our position. This project was not sufficiently thought through at the outset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to contribute to this debate on the national stadium. The farce that has developed as a result of the conflicting plans to build a national stadium should end now but the strong position taken by the Government on its plans to proceed with Stadium Ireland and also the plans by the FAI to build its own stadium will ensure that this farce develops even further. I concur with the views expressed by my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, that an outside mediator should bring the sides together to thrash out a compromise in relation to the building of a national stadium.</P>
      <P>A whole range of issues will arise if separate plans are undertaken to build a stadium, and at the centre of those is the cost. Many people in this House will have seen last week's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary on the St. Teresa's Gardens flats complex in Dublin's south inner city. In that documentary, one of the most poignant interviews was the one with a young teenager who explained how he had nowhere to play football. He pointed out that there was a tarmac playing pitch in the complex but the markings had long since faded and the goal posts were broken down. While youngsters were using this pitch for joyriding, he explained that he and his peers would like a proper place to play football.</P>
      <P>Our booming economy has failed to deliver a basic football pitch in one of the most disadvantaged communities in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are hundreds more communities throughout the country fundraising locally for better sports facilities. The Minister's Department houses a huge number of applications for lottery funding from many organisations struggling to provide these basic facilities, and St. Teresa's Gardens is a prime example. Many of those organisations have been turned down time and again, and all this is happening at a time when the Government and the FAI are prepared to build two national football stadia at a cost of many millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>I am not arguing against a national soccer stadium and a national centre for sports but I do not see the sense in delivering on the double when the money could be better spent building a playing field in St. Teresa's Gardens or in the hard-pressed communities which do not have facilities. If the Government and the FAI came to a compromise, we could have a national stadium and the money would be freed up to deliver what is needed by sports facilities in other communities. If both parties arrogantly chase their objective of building a stadium, the rows will only begin when the national matches are held. Indeed, doubts have been raised publicly over the location of both projects at Abbotstown and Tallaght. Both locations need more efficient public transport systems to ensure the safe and quick movement of patrons to and from matches. From experience throughout Europe, it seems that best practice is now to locate national stadia at central locations where there is a convergence of public transport. In the event of both the FAI and the Government coming together, I suggest they reconsider the location of the sports centre.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's decision today to correct the record in relation to the cost of the national stadium. As chairperson of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, I received clarification on the cost of the project from Mr. Paddy Teahon after he gave incorrect figures on the cost during a presentation to the committee.</P>

        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Last Thursday, 17 January, was another black day for the economy of County Mayo. Out of the blue came the announcement that 90 jobs would be lost at the Dawn Meats plant in Ballyhaunis. Within hours came the second sledgehammer blow &ndash; the announcement that the Henniges Elastomers plant in Ballina was to close with the loss of 220 jobs. In the case of Henniges, the statistics speak for themselves. Last year the company paid out £5 million in wages to an employment force manufacturing car components for some of Europe's top car manufacturers. The average age of the work force is 35 years. The work force is 80% male and 20% female. In the case of Dawn Meats in Ballyhaunis, the job losses are a direct consequence of the cattle cull arising from the BSE crisis. These are virtually all jobs filled by men and the annual wage loss to the economy is £1.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Henniges Elastomers was set up in 1989. It has an excellent work force and has won quality standard awards, best supplier awards and NSIO safety awards as the best company in the west for 1997, 1998 and 2000. Local management, unions and workers worked long and hard to try to get the costings correct and in line with international markets. The restructuring worked well but incredibly and ironically when the closure announcement came the company was at its most efficient and economic in its 11 year existence. <Col N="129" /> However, the success achieved was not acknowledged by, or good enough, for the United States company bosses who looked at the long-term situation and profit margins.</P>
    <P>The job losses in Ballina not only have dire and immediate consequences for the north Mayo region but are also an indicator for the economy as a whole. Irish wage inflation was given by the company as the official single most important reason for closing down the plant and relocating the jobs in eastern Europe. Whatever about the national economy, Mayo and western areas have not seen the fruits of the Celtic tiger. The Government and IDA so-called commitment to a greater regional dispersal of jobs is simply not there. If one wants proof of that one need look no further than the recently published IDA figures for last year. Of the 13,780 jobs announced nationally only 1,246 or 10% came to the seven western counties and half of these went to an already over-loaded and exploding Galway city. My understanding is that of the 600 remaining jobs scattered outside Galway city over the seven counties only a mere eight jobs came to County Mayo. All the talk, task forces and promises are not delivering in terms of creating jobs or staving off job losses.</P>
    <P>A fragile economy like Ballina cannot sustain an annual wage loss of £5 million per annum. It is a mortal blow. Will the Minister of State say when exactly the Minister or the IDA learnt of the plans by Henniges to close its operation in Ballina? What contact did he, the Minister or the IDA have with the parent company? Did he or the Minister contact the company executives to give them assurances in relation to Government policy on wages and wage inflation? Was there any attempt to try to put together a rescue package to salvage all or some of the jobs or did the Government and the IDA simply hoist the white flag and accept the decision and consequences as inevitable?</P>
    <P>The people of Ballina, north Mayo and the entire county are asking, what now and where do Ballina and Ballyhaunis go from here? What we need is action and jobs as a matter of urgency. There are issues of families' survival, mortgages and people's futures involved in these closures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Harney, and I very much regret the announcement by Henniges Elastomers Ireland of its intention to cease production in Ballina. Henniges has provided valuable employment over the past 11 years and has contributed greatly to the economic life of the Mayo region. The announcement came as a great shock <Col N="130" /> to all of those concerned in Government, the Department, the IDA and locally.</P>
    <P>The company employs 170 people in the manufacture of rubber moulded parts used in vibration control in the European auto industry. It is a subsidiary of Henniges, Germany, which in turn is owned by Gencorp Inc. USA. Gencorp acquired Henniges in 1995 as part of its globalisation strategy. Gencorp, a $400 million market leader in the US in vehicle sealing systems, bought Henniges to broaden its product base and gain a presence in the European market. The acquisition did not prove successful. In the past year new management in Gencorp has unsuccessfully tried to sell Henniges.</P>
    <P>Last December Gencorp purchased Europe's largest vehicle sealing manufacturer, Draftex, which has $400 million sales in Europe. The acquisition will make Gencorp the world leader in vehicle sealing systems. To accelerate the sale of Henniges, it is transferring some production from its German plant to a Draftex plant in the Czech Republic with the loss of 100 jobs. It is closing its Irish plant and transferring the production to its plant in Germany where, with more favourable logistics and increased plant utilisation, it can effect savings of DM5.5 million per annum.</P>
    <P>On 11 January last the company announced the closure of its plant in Ballina. The reasons for the closure are that the plant is not profitable and the business is not core to the parent company. The Ballina plant has suffered from under-investment, loss of markets, price erosion, poor product mix and high logistic costs. It was particularly vulnerable to increases in labour costs. The first redundancies are due to commence in February.</P>
    <P>Since the closure announcement, FÁS, on behalf of the Department, has been in contact with the general manager of the company on a number of occasions. A FÁS team has been established to assist those being made redundant with guidance and career counselling, in matching for job vacancies and, if necessary, by providing training courses. IDA Ireland is also working with the company in attempting to get a suitable project for the Ballina facility. The company is still in operation and operations are to be phased out over the coming months. In the meantime the company has provided the IDA with a building specification of the plant and a skills inventory of the work force with a view to securing a replacement industry. IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies over the past 18 months with the objective of delivering 50% of all new jobs from green field projects into the Border, midlands and west region in the period to the end of 2002. Results for 2000 are ahead of expectations compared to the three year target set out at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>In recent years IDA Ireland has had significant success in attracting new projects to County <Col N="131" /> Mayo. In 1998 Lionbridge Technologies established its European Software Test Centre in Ballina and it currently employs 51 permanent employees. In 1999 the Cedar Group plc, a UK company, established a call centre in Castlebar. The centre already employs 61 people. It has also established a software development centre in Castlebar, which employs 56 software developers. Last year also, Dekko Heating Technologies established its European manufacturing operation at the Bunree industrial estate in Ballina and, at full production, will create 80 jobs. Coca Cola has completed the construction and commissioning of its facility in Ballina which employs 178 people in a state-of-the-art, modern production facility. Last year also the German company, Schutz, established an industrial packaging manufacturing operation at the Asahi facility in Killala to supply the needs of Coca Cola and other customers in Ireland. It will provide 25 new jobs at full production.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, on behalf of the Government, has asked the north Mayo enterprise initiative, chaired by the Mayo county manager, to examine the implications of this company's closure and to include its findings in the final report of the initiative. The IDA and other State agencies have been asked to actively promote Ballina as a location for new investment, particularly bearing in mind there is a period of some months before the company fully closes. The availability of a prime facility and a highly committed workforce will be a strong attraction of potential investors.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the statistics I have quoted that the Government, through the IDA, has made trojan efforts to attract investment to Mayo. Enterprise Ireland has done tremendous work in regard to medium-sized industries and the Mayo County Enterprise Board has done tremendous work at the micro level. The Deputy can be assured the Government and my Department, led by the Tánaiste, and with the support of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, in Ballina, will do what we can as quickly as possible to find a replacement industry for Ballina during the year ahead.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leat as an cheist thábhachtach seo a ardú anseo. I am particularly grateful to you as I now have facts at my disposal which I did not, regrettably, on 29 November 2000 when I last spoke in the House on the BSE crisis. At that time I said that the veterinary and hospital body parts incineration was essential to kill disease and that incineration is needed in the case of BSE. I have since discovered research which indicates that is wrong and that incineration is not an effective way to kill BSE and such <Col N="132" /> diseases, nor is it the only way to kill the infective agent.</P>
      <P>Regarding the effectiveness of incineration, the UK Government and environment agency have since learned from trials by Powergen and National Power in two power stations that BSE strands survive at temperatures of 1,500º centigrade. Professor Richard Lacey, professor of medical microbiology in Leeds University, also has evidence that the BSE infective agent is incredibly resistant to high temperatures. Professor Gareth Jones of Cambridge University cites evidence that with the high moisture content of tonnes of carcases being incinerated, the agent that leads to BSE and variant CJD could enter the atmosphere.</P>
      <P>The BSE inquiry report in the UK, volume 6, chapter 10, section 10.105, gave rise to Dr. Hunter, former deputy director of the UK Agriculture and Food Research Council, saying that the scrapie agent is exceptionally heat resistant also and a large proportion would simply depart with the smoke and gases generated by the incineration. He conceives of few better techniques for distributing the agent far and wide over the countryside. Dr. Conchur Ó Bradaigh, an engineering lecturer at NUI, Galway, cited a study by the National Academy of Science in the US in March 2000 which stated that scrapie could survive 600º centigrade in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 9 January.</P>
      <P>I also know now that other less expensive and more effective technologies exist to kill the BSE infective agent and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has also met scientists and developers in the interim to discuss such technologies independently. One such technology, alkaline hydrolysis, has been in operation in the USA successfully treating hospital and university animal and human pathogens and other such infective waste for the past eight years, with no problems as yet. This technology would involve digesting BSE infected carcases in an alkaline solution to break down the BSE protein at a temperature of 150º centigrade for three hours. The mechanism involves weighing the carcases in a basket prior to immersion to calculate the conditions and correct quantity of solution needed and once the animal waste is processed and deemed BSE free it can be discharged to be anaerobically digested, as happens with pig slurry or other such BOD rich matter even on more progressive farms in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantages of alkaline hydrolysis are it is cheaper than incineration, an important consideration according to the Minister, it is more effective in that it is easier to guarantee than the incomplete combustion sometimes experienced by incineration and it is also more controllable taking account of power cuts or other eventualities whereby the process can be started again with<Col N="133" /> out the problems that would be caused to the incineration process.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State, who is representing him, to be open to the research and to impress on the European Commission that there are alternatives to incineration in regard to dealing with BSE. According to today's edition of <i>The Guardian,</i> the goalposts are shifting in our understanding of BSE and that must be acknowledged. We must keep up to date in this regard. I had hoped in November 2000 that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, would not adopt the role of a trojan horse, town crier for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in pushing a case for general municipal incineration, but sadly in the interim that is what Deputy Walsh has been doing.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, his first responsibility is to act in the interests of farmers, their land and animals and the future of sustainable farming and its dependent communities. I ask the Minister of State to state that he is open to the research which is coming to hand. It will lead to a more sustainable way of dealing with BSE and will also ensure incinerators will not be foisted on Ireland, which are clearly not essential and which other countries such as New Zealand that are competing with us in international food markets are able to avoid. If we go down the incinerating route we will lose our competitive advantage as well as damaging our future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Regard for the best available scientific advice has been the cornerstone of the management by successive Governments of the BSE problem over the past decade. The range of measures put in place, in many instances ahead of other EU member states and in advance of EU legal requirements for such measures, has been directed at containing and eliminating the disease, and this remains the case.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures, all cattle presented for slaughter at meat factories are subjected to ante-mortem inspection by Department veterinary inspectors. Animals showing signs of ill health not attributable to BSE are in any event rapid tested for the disease and the carcase retained until a test result is received. All these controls have been subject to scrutiny and endorsement by a variety of bodies, most notably the food and veterinary office of the EU and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that on foot of decisions taken by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers in December 2000, a programme of rapid testing of cattle over 30 months intended for human consumption was initiated in Ireland on 2 January. I am pleased that to date almost 32,500 cattle over <Col N="134" /> 30 months have been tested and all have tested negative.</P>
    <P>On this basis consumers at home and in export markets have every reason for confidence in Irish beef. It is heartening that meat retailers, based on their sales, have confirmed that consumers continue to regard home produced beef as an integral part of their diet and their weekly shopping. I believe it will not be long before our valued and discerning export customers regain their confidence in Irish beef which was victim to the effects of a wave of concern about European beef in general.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a large and significant livestock and meat processing industry which brings employment and generates earnings for many people within and outside farming. Any such industry will generate waste, and waste management is an absolute necessity if, as a country, we are to enjoy the economic and social benefits of this element of our agri-food sector. We cannot expect to have a vibrant, international-scale livestock and meat processing industry and avoid dealing with the waste which it generates. Inevitable by-products of the livestock and meat processing industry are large quantities of MBM and SRM which must be removed and, ultimately, destroyed. I ask the House to note that advice of the EU scientific steering committee has recommended incineration as a safe method of disposal of the material.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the total ban on the feeding of MBM to farm animals since the beginning of the year, Ireland is facing the challenge of disposal of significant additional quantities of MBM. We will also need to destroy increasing volumes of SRM material and the carcases of BSE suspect animals. In the absence of a domestic means of dealing with waste products from the livestock sector, the only option available at the moment is to store the product pending export for destruction elsewhere. This can be regarded as nothing more than a holding operation and it would be sheer delusion for anyone to take comfort from it or to believe it absolves us from the necessity of putting in place a means of ultimately destroying this waste in Ireland.</P>
    <P>All options for the safe disposal of MBM are currently being considered by my Department in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency. These include the process of alkaline hydrolysis which has not yet been validated. I should, however, say to those who are putting this forward as some form of panacea that we understand that even if this particular process is found to be acceptable, it would only be suitable for handling small volumes of material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <P>Is incineration a panacea?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As matters now stand, the only suitable and available means of ultimately <Col N="135" /> destroying the growing volume of waste which I have mentioned, and which will itself become a potentially major environmental problem, is thermal treatment. There is no getting away from this reality and to avoid facing it is the worst form of environmental hypocrisy. It is entirely wrong to seek to lead the public to believe that there are any easy options for dealing with this problem or that there are painless, magic solutions which are somehow known to a few people but not to Governments and others managing the BSE problem in Ireland and elsewhere. It is equally wrong to paint a picture of modern thermal treatment plants as some form of malign smokestack industries.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, thermal treatment plants which dispose of animal waste, operate safely and to the highest standards elsewhere in Europe, in countries which attach a very high importance to environmental protection. As regards suggestions that incineration spreads the BSE prion, I would ask the House to note that this has been emphatically dismissed in recent days by environmental experts. I would suggest that it is being put forward more as a smokescreen to enable certain people to alter their position and again seek the comfort of avoiding the issue rather than as a serious proposition.</P>
      <P>In the course of a debate in this House on BSE on 29 November last, a few short weeks ago, there was a very welcome degree of political consensus on all sides of the House on the need for incineration in the context of dealing with the waste thrown up by the BSE issue. This consensus included the Green Party. On that occasion Deputy Sargent said</P>
      <P>In common with all parties in the House, the Green Party accepts that for veterinary and hospital body parts, incineration is necessary to kill disease. The quickest way to increase veterinary incineration capacity in Ireland is to make it clear &ndash; this is the Minister's responsibility &ndash; that it is not municipal, industrial or hazardous waste incineration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent went on to say &ldquo;BSE needs incineration and it must be clearly stated that this is the purpose of the incineration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This was a welcome, if rare, venture by the Green Party into the realm of dealing with the realities of the situation and facing up to the hard issues. It was welcomed at the time by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Walsh. It is particularly regrettable that Deputy Sargent is now furiously back pedalling from this position and is resorting to various devices to legitimise his sudden U-turn. Once again, he and his colleagues are resorting to creating the illusion of easy answers to this issue and to avoiding reality.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether to be sad or sorry for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this occasion. I have the greatest sympathy for him, however, because he must be deeply embarrassed by this matter. The spectacle of people being paraded publicly in chains was one of the saddest sights I have ever seen in this country. These people had travelled abroad to seek employment, as they were legally entitled to do. They had all the necessary documentation and had been approved before legitimately entering the country to seek employment. Yet, somebody arbitrarily decided that they did not have sufficient resources at their disposal. Who gave them the right to determine whether these people had sufficient resources? They were here legally and were entitled to go about their business, but what did we do? We arrested them. The Minister arrested them, put them in prison and treated them to most God awful spectacle of Irish hospitality that anybody has ever seen. It was the worst manifestation of zero tolerance I have seen. I do not know how Irish people all over the world felt about this matter, but I know how I felt about it. How would the Minister feel if Irish people abroad were treated in that fashion? How would he feel about it if all the hundreds of thousands of people who have left this country to seek employment over the centuries had been treated in that way? In our so-called civilised generation of the enlightened and economically improved Celtic tiger economy, what way was that to show recognition of those who are worse off than ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, how legal was it? Can the Minister stand over the fact that these people were treated illegally? They were entitled to go about their business. How would the Minister feel if the next time he went abroad on business he was chained hand and foot and thrown into prison because somebody arbitrarily decided he did not have enough money to sustain himself? What <Col N="137" /> about all the Irish people who left our shores and went to seek their fortunes elsewhere? What resources did they have? Did they always have the necessary resources so that some bureaucrat somewhere could decide they could continue or not?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister apologised to the Moldovans, on behalf of the people and on his own behalf, for the disgraceful and disgusting manner in which they were treated? Has he given instructions that it is never to happen again? Such things must not recur and such decisions must not be taken on behalf of the Irish people. Last week's spectacle must rank among the saddest and sorriest ever seen on this island &ndash; a country that has suffered oppression, poverty and deprivation. Its citizens were forced to wander all over the world to seek employment and better living conditions. It is sad to think that an example should have been made of these people in this way. They were legally entitled to be here. They were professional people, engineers and dentists, and they had jobs to go to. In those circumstances, if the Minister has not apologised to their nation, we in this House should apologise for the disgraceful way they were treated &ndash; seriously eroding their human and civil rights &ndash; which has held this country up to ridicule by the rest of the free world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week 19 Moldovan men, who came to this country to work with valid papers and visas, were treated like criminals. They were detained in Mountjoy Prison and taken to the Four Courts in chains, an event which caused revulsion and anger in every right thinking person in the country. Eventually, through the sterling work of a number of people in north Kildare, some justice and humanity was shown to these men. However, what occurred last week was a national disgrace. These 19 men were abandoned and treated in an inhumane and disgraceful fashion. It was only through the efforts of a number of individual citizens that an end to the nightmare was achieved. I want to pay tribute, in particular, to the work done in this regard by Mr. Bertie Dunne of Naas.</P>
      <P>The record shows that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not lift a finger to help these men. They were thrown into jail for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of legitimately seeking work, while the Government was quite content to sit back and twiddle its thumbs. In a week when the Minister found time to wax lyrical about a new readmission agreement with the Governments of Bulgaria and Poland, he could not issue one word of concern about the injustice being perpetrated against 19 innocent men. That, too, is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the strange world of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, perhaps he thought it was a good thing and that it would send out the message that Ireland was tough on immigrants, legal or illegal. <Col N="138" /> The fact that 19 men had to pay the price was a minor issue as far as the Minister was concerned. It was only when public outrage at the treatment of these men became obvious that the Minister took a view. Late last Friday the Minister claimed that new arrangements would be put in place to prevent innocent people being flung into jail. Great. This was an appalling response from the Minister and the Government. His craven cowardice in the face of this issue will come to characterise his whole policy towards immigration and asylum. If this scandal is to teach us anything it is that we must immediately put in place an immigration policy as distinct from an asylum process. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has published one of the most comprehensive policy papers in relation to asylum and immigration, yet the Government refuses to even recognise the mess over which it is presiding.</P>
    <P>In the wake of this latest scandal, it is essential that the Government abandons the hostility and suspicion of non-nationals which has dominated policy to date. This country faces a serious labour shortage. Official reports suggest that we will need in excess of 300,000 immigrant workers over the coming years. The intolerant and conservative attitude of the Government in relation to immigration is in direct conflict with this reality and must be reversed. That is particularly true of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its officials.</P>
    <P>Ten days after these innocent men were thrown in jail &ndash; they were declared entirely innocent of any wrongdoing by the High Court &ndash; an official apology from the Taoiseach or the Minister has not been forthcoming. This adds insult to injustice. These men deserve not only an apology, but compensation for the horror that was visited upon them courtesy of the Irish State. This compensation should be agreed between the Department and the legal representatives of the 19 Moldovans. Does the Government intend hauling them before the courts again to seek justice? I could not believe my ears today when I heard that each of these workers, who received this treatment, was required to pay an additional £125 each for their new work permits.</P>
    <P>I also urge the Minister to desist with the current practice of hauling innocent people before the courts in chains generally. It is a cornerstone of our judicial system that people are innocent until proven guilty, yet innocent people are paraded in chains through the streets of Dublin each day the courts sit. Security considerations can be adequately dealt with without inflicting public humility and disgrace on people who will come before the courts. The pictures printed in our newspapers last week should not be repeated and it is not beyond the imagination of the Department, the Prison Service or the Courts Service to come up with more appropriate alternatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> This whole affair has brought shame not only on the Government, but on Ireland's reputation. The inaction and cowardice of the Government throughout the affair has been disgraceful. Unfortunately, I cannot say it has been shocking because it happens regularly. This Government has utterly failed to devise a humane and responsible policy on the issues of asylum and immigration. It has spoken out of both sides of its mouth content for the likes of Deputy Callely to stoke up racist fears, while officially talking the language of inclusion. The direct result is that 19 men, genuinely and legitimately seeking work, were confined to prison like criminals abandoned by the State. Fortunately, in this case, the citizens of this country have demonstrated humanity and generosity that is nowhere to be found in the Government's policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that I preface my remarks this evening by pointing out that, contrary to a widely held perception, many of the issues relating to this case have not yet been determined by the courts and are the subject of a judicial review application by the persons in question. In addition, the question of costs in relation to the Article 40 proceedings, which were determined last Thursday, have been reserved. The Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that my remarks must be such as not to prejudice the court's fair consideration of these matters.</P>
      <P>On the question of legal entry to the State, the situation is now, as it has always been, that possession of a valid visa does not guarantee entry, although failure to have one if required is grounds for refusal. This is made very clear in the information provided with the visa application form. All non-EEA nationals, whether visa required or not, require leave to land upon arrival. A valid work permit, which is issued to a prospective employer, merely authorises that employer but not any other employer to employ a specified non-EEA national for a specified period. The work permit application form makes clear to an employer that the issue of a work permit does not of itself authorise the person named therein to enter or reside in the State and that admission and duration of stay are subject to the control of the immigration authorities. The work permit itself clearly states that it is valid for the employment stated and not for any other kind of work or for any other employer.</P>

      <P>On the matters raised by the Deputies, the facts are that on the morning of Sunday, 21 January 2001, a group of 19 Moldovan nationals, all male, presented themselves to the immigration authorities in Dublin Airport having <Col N="140" /> arrived on a direct flight from Bucharest in Romania.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>They were in possession of valid Irish entry visas and copies of work permits authorising a company called Kildare Chilling to employ them as general operatives. Very shortly before the arrival of the group in Dublin Airport, Kildare Chilling informed immigration officials in writing that no jobs were available for the group and that their agent in Moldova, who had recruited the group on their behalf, had been informed of this several weeks previously. Kildare Chilling had, according to the information available to me, made no attempt to bring to the attention of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment the fact that the jobs were not available, an action which would have afforded the authorities an opportunity to deter the group from travelling in the first place.</P>
      <P>The recruitment consultant who organises the recruitment of Moldovan workers on Kildare Chilling's behalf, has given further information to the Garda national immigration bureau on the circumstances leading up to the incident in question. It appears that the permits were issued to Kildare Chilling as part of a batch of 50 such permits last October and that 25 of the workers in question had commenced employment with the company on foot of an invitation transmitted on behalf of Kildare Chilling through a Moldovan agent. Those who commenced work had been specifically invited to report for work by the company, had their airline tickets supplied by the company and were met at the airport on arrival on 15 October 2000 and 24 October 2000. However, Kildare Chilling claimed that difficulties in the beef sector meant that they did not require all of the persons they had earlier sought to recruit and, therefore, that an invitation was not extended by the company to the remainder of the group and airline tickets were not provided by the company on their behalf.</P>
      <P>On arrival the group maintained that they were unaware that the jobs were no longer available. Following inquiries by the immigration authorities, the group was, in accordance with long-standing practice, refused leave to land under section 5(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended which states: &ldquo;An Immigration Officer may refuse leave to land to an alien coming from a place outside the State other than Great Britain or Northern Ireland where the immigration officer is satisfied. . . .  that the alien is not in a position to support himself and any accompanying dependants.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The immigration officer in question gave evidence in court to the effect that the inquiry at airport lasted more than two hours and in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, she refused the 19 men leave to land as she considered that each person was not in a position to support himself. In making that inquiry, the officer was assisted by other immigration staff, including the sergeant in charge on the day who obtained professional translation services in order to ensure full information could be obtained. She also indicated that if alternative work permits had been available the 19 men would have been granted leave to land.</P>
      <P>The group was then detained in Mountjoy prison under section 5(4) of the Aliens Order, 1946, pending their removal from the State.</P>

It subsequently advised the immigration authorities that the Thursday flight would not operate and arrangements were made for the group's departure on the following Sunday.</P>
      <P>The immigration officer gave evidence in court that her decision to refuse leave to land was based on the following facts: the information that Kildare Chilling did not have employment for the 19 men and no other work permits existed at that time; the 19 men had approximately US$3,000 between them, some with as little as US$ 65 each and had no accommodation arranged and&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the 19 men had return flights for 18 February 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of those facts, the State argued in court last Thursday that the detention for the purposes of returning the 19 men was lawful. However, during the hearing of the Article 40 inquiry, when it became clear that there were persons present in court who were prepared to offer the men employment, the State in answer to the court's question, confirmed that if work was being offered and new work permits were being issued, the State would release the men immediately. Consequently, the court ruled that the detention of the men from that point onwards was unlawful given that it was accepted that a clear and bona fide offer of employment was available to them. The court also reserved the question of costs. The court made no determination regarding the decision of the immigration authorities to refuse the applicants leave to land in circumstances where they were in possession of valid visas and work permits, on the extent of the inquiries made by the immigration authorities prior to making that decision nor on the initial detention of the <Col N="142" /> persons in question with a view to their removal from the State by the carrier which brought them to the frontiers of the State.</P>
    <P>Turning to the more general issues raised, one would be forgiven for concluding from some of the public comment on this issue that immigration procedures in Ireland operate in an indiscriminate, paranoid or even racist fashion. The reality is that now, as in the past, only a tiny proportion of all passengers are refused entry to the State and that every effort is made to minimise the inconvenience to genuine travellers. The State relies on the vigilance of immigration officers to maintain and operate effective immigration controls in accordance with legislation provided by the Oireachtas&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and these controls have operated under successive Governments in the public interest. To put the operation of those controls in context in relation to this incident, I would point to the fact that more than 18,000 work permits were issued to Irish employers to employ non-EEA nationals during the year 2000. The permits were issued to a wide spectrum of nationalities and in respect of vacancies in a broad range of skill areas, not just to high skill North Americans as is regularly reported. In addition, the Government has put in place a fast-track scheme to attract persons in areas of particular skill shortage. Almost 1,400 people availed of this scheme last year. I have been a consistent advocate of measures to promote legal migration where such migration is in Ireland's interests and my Department has responded flexibly to these new challenges.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 124, 253 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>The increasing number of sectarian attacks in Larne is a matter of the most serious concern to the Government. There were some 76 reported incidents last year alone, although the actual figure may well be higher than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These incidents have included threats, criminal damage and the flying of loyalist paramilitary flags. There have also been death threats, pipe bomb attacks and shots fired into houses as well as an orchestrated campaign of intimidation and violence against particular local families. As we entered the new year, there were three particularly serious attacks on the homes of Catholic families in Larne &ndash; two pipe bombs and one gun attack. Following those attacks, the former Sec<Col N="146" /> retary of State, Mr. Mandelson, visited the town on 17 January last.</P>
    <P>I condemn all sectarian attacks, whether on Catholics or Protestants in Larne and elsewhere, in the strongest possible terms. They are despicable acts designed at the very least to frighten and to intimidate people out of their homes.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed that the police response to these incidents has been inadequate and that they have failed to halt the attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice. It is essential that the necessary effort and resources be devoted to combating sectarian crime in the town.</P>
    <P>The Government has raised its concerns about the situation in Larne directly with the British Government on a regular basis in recent years. Officials of my Department maintain contact with members of the Catholic community, including the local SDLP Assembly member for East Antrim, Mr. Danny O'Connor.</P>
    <P>I met Mr. O'Connor in Dublin on 28 November last when he gave me a dossier of some 65 cases of sectarian assaults in the town over the past two years. This dossier was passed to the British Government and we pressed for immediate and effective action to counter the serious problems in Larne. I also spoke with Mr. O'Connor on 16 January following the recent attacks.</P>
    <P>I expressed the Government's concerns about the situation in Larne when I met the then Secretary of State on 5 December last and I will do so again when I meet the newly appointed Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, at our first meeting.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement recognised the right to freely choose one's place of residence and the right to freedom from sectarian harassment. It is imperative that these rights be protected and vindicated in Larne. The Government will continue to monitor the situation in that town.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 123 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland became a member of the Security Council on 1 January 2001 for a two year period. Membership of the council has placed Ireland at the centre of decision-making by the body with primary responsibility under the Charter of the <Col N="147" /> United Nations for international peace and security.</P>
    <P>As we made clear during our campaign, Ireland's approach to Security Council membership will be informed by the principles which have inspired our foreign policy under successive Governments. Since joining the UN in 1955, our vocation has been to play a distinctive role in areas such as peacekeeping, nuclear disarmament, human rights and development co-operation. This record was central to our campaign and will guide our actions on the council.</P>
    <P>Ireland is nearing the end of its first month on the Council. We were assigned the chair of the Angola Sanctions Committee on 4 January. The committee was established in 1993 to oversee the mandatory sanctions against UNITA, one of the parties to the conflict in Angola. Among the major issues facing Ireland this month have been the renewal of peacekeeping mandates in Lebanon &ndash; UNIFIL &ndash; and East Timor &ndash; UNTAET &ndash; discussions on lifting the arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea, consideration of the situation in Sierra Leone and in the Great Lakes region, and a thematic debate on HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>As we have seen in our first weeks on the council, the agenda is largely dictated by the pressing international issues of the day. It is already clear that African issues will demand much attention. Ireland attracted a high level of support from African nations in the Security Council election and we will remain highly responsive to the need to develop effective conflict prevention strategies for Africa.</P>
    <P>As well as chairing the Angola Sanctions Committee, Ireland is also now vice-chair of the sanctions committees on Liberia and Rwanda as well as a member of the other seven Security Council sanctions committees. I am keenly aware that there is an urgent need to identify how sanctions can be targeted effectively without causing suffering to innocent civilian populations. Security Council membership will give Ireland an opportunity to make a positive contribution to the development of a more effective and humane sanctions policy.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a long-standing contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations, is also committed to ensuring that the Security Council puts in place realistic and effective peacekeeping mandates with clear mission goals. We have already participated in a very worthwhile council debate on strengthening co-operation with troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland will hold the monthly Presidency of the Security Council in October 2001. Our priority will be to manage the business of the council effectively for the month and to ensure that the council reacts speedily to crisis situations as and when they arise. In preparing for the Presidency, the Government will also consider whether the council might take up issues of particular interest to Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the human rights situation in a number of regions of Indonesia, especially Irian Jaya, or West Papua as it is sometimes known, and also Aceh and the Moluccas. In all these there are religious and ethnic conflicts and secessionist tendencies. The situation is further compounded by the wide range of challenges facing the Indonesian Government in the period of consolidation of democracy and reforms in the wake of the 30 years of the Suharto dictatorship.</P>
      <P>I am following closely developments in Indonesia, including Irian Jaya. I am glad to receive information, which comes from many sources, and my officials meet with concerned parties to discuss such matters.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its EU partners have repeatedly made our concerns known to the Indonesian authorities. Last November the EU publicly expressed its concern at the climate of violence prevailing in a number of Indonesian provinces, including Irian Jaya. The most recent outbreak of violence in Irian Jaya at the beginning of last December claimed many lives and this issue was subsequently raised by the EU with Indonesia at the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Laos later that month.</P>
      <P>In this context the EU reiterated our readiness to support the efforts of the Indonesian Government towards political, economic and military reform, including moves towards decentralisation as a way of addressing secessionist demands in parts of the country, without affecting Indonesia's territorial integrity. The EU will continue to encourage the Indonesian Government to resolve regional conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means.</P>
      <P>The EU has also initiated a political dialogue with Indonesia in which human rights issues are raised, and we will utilise every opportunity to encourage the Indonesian Government to respect human rights and the rule of law. Ireland further welcomes as a positive step the establishment of an Indonesian national commission on human rights which has started to work in co-operation with Mrs. Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in the period both before and since Christmas, the two Governments and the pro-Agreement parties have been engaged in intensive efforts to reach an agreed basis on which we can ensure the inclusive operation of the institutions and the full implementation of outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>Throughout, I have remained in close contact with the parties and with former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson. In my statement on Mr. Mandelson's resignation, I paid tribute to his significant personal contribution to the peace process and I would like to avail of this opportunity to repeat my best wishes for the future. I have spoken to his successor, Dr. John Reid, on the telephone, and I look forward to meeting him in the very near future. The Taoiseach has also been very actively engaged together with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. They will meet tomorrow to review the situation.</P>
      <P>Our discussions have enabled us to make genuine progress and we now have a greater understanding of where each of the parties stands. We are, nonetheless, at a most delicate stage and I do not think that Deputies would expect me to go into detail on matters which are the subject of the most sensitive of negotiations. However, the issues with which we are dealing are well known. Broadly, these include: ensuring the successful operation of the institutions, including the North/South Ministerial Council, on a fully inclusive basis; continued progress on demilitarisation and putting arms permanently beyond use; and an outcome on policing which will ensure the necessary cross-community support for the new service.</P>
      <P>In the past year we have seen the tangible improvements that the institutions under the Agreement have begun to make in the lives of the people they serve. The benefits we all stand to gain if we can resolve our difficulties now are obvious. All the parties want to reach a successful outcome. All are working in good faith to bring it about.</P>
      <P>It is my firm belief that, if all continue to approach our discussions with a positive and constructive attitude, we will succeed in finding a way forward.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 102 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>The humanitarian situation in Iraq is of major concern to the Government. We are taking every opportunity at the United Nations and elsewhere to hold discussions on this complex issue with the various parties, including other Security Council members and key United Nations personnel. In these discussions we are stressing the urgent need to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, especially children, and to greatly improve the conditions of the general population directly affected by the implementation of the UN sanctions.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Security Council, our approach to the situation in Iraq is informed both by the need to address the human suffering and to ensure that Iraq complies with the decisions of the Security Council. All countries are required under the UN Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council, and Ireland stands by this obligation.</P>
      <P>Since the Security Council unconditionally removed the ceiling on the export of oil, the major problem is not one of revenue to fund the purchase of needed supplies. Instead it is a problem of clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme. There have been unacceptable hold-ups, due both to the inadequate level of co-operation by the Iraqi authorities and to the workings of the sanctions committee. The Security Council should take greater account of the humanitarian situation in its further deliberations on this matter. This is the most useful course to follow.</P>
      <P>Our consistent policy, therefore, is to advocate more significant reductions in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme. I have previously informed the House that the Taoiseach and I raised this issue with the former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, in Washington last March, and I would urge the Bush Administration to accelerate the progress made in reducing the delays on needed medicines and spare parts for Iraqi infrastructure. I expect that, in any event, the new administration will wish to review existing US foreign policy positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> Last March, acting under the provisions of Resolution 1284, the council introduced a streamlined procedure for the approval of humanitarian supplies. Under this procedure, $2 billion worth of contracts for the food, educational, medical, agricultural, water and sanitation sectors were approved on a basis of notification to the sanctions committee. A much enhanced allocation for spare parts for the ailing Iraqi oil industry, a doubling of the budget to $1.2 billion, was also approved. The Security Council has since built on these provisions, most recently in Resolution 1330 which extends the range of sectors requiring notification only. This progress needs to be developed further.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that the Iraqi authorities co-operate adequately with the oil for food programme. For example, Iraqi failure to process orders has led to $1.5 billion worth of goods being placed on hold and Iraqi attempts to levy a surcharge on oil exports recently led to a suspension of exports. The Iraqi Government is also responsible for diversion of revenue through its large-scale oil smuggling.</P>
    <P>I know that a delegation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs visited Iraq and Jordan last month and that the delegation was received at a high level. I will carefully study the delegation's report on the visit.</P>
    <P>There is a growing international awareness of the need to ensure that economic sanctions, which are the alternative to the use of armed force, accomplish their intended objectives. This month, a working group of the Security Council has been examining the general question of the effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes. Its major report is due to come out within days. It is expected to stress the need to take much more careful account of humanitarian aspects. This should influence in a constructive direction the debate about the effect of sanctions on the Iraqi people.</P>
    <P>The basis for the continued imposition of UN sanctions on Iraq remains the Iraqi Government's refusal to co-operate with the UN commissions appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The ten years since the Gulf War is too long a period for the stand-off to persist at such a dreadful human cost. I call upon the Government of Iraq to comply finally with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 1284 provides for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with a new disarmament supervisory commission, UNMOVIC, and compliance with the conditions imposed by the Security Council. I wish to see the necessary co-operation from Baghdad to allow concrete progress to be made on the suspension and ultimate lifting of the sanctions. This would be a major step towards the return of Iraq to its rightful place in the international community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> The Government has also directly addressed the humanitarian issues. A grant of £100,000 by Ireland Aid to the International Committee of the Red Cross was made last November to address the rehabilitation of health, water and sanitation facilities in Iraq.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 263 together.</P>
      <P>Early in August last, when my Department first received reports of the disappearance of Tristan James Murray and his Colombian friend, Javier Nova, from the town of Tolima in central Colombia, where they lived as members of the Atlantis environmental community, I instructed our Ambassador based in Mexico City to use all possible means available to him to try to establish what had happened to Tristan and Javier. The following month the Taoiseach personally raised the case with President Pastrana of Colombia when they met in the margins of the UN Millennium Summit in New York.</P>
      <P>Following investigations in Tolima, local people came forward to confirm that they had witnessed the killing of Tristan and Javier by renegade elements of the FARC guerrilla group. Enquiries made by our Ambassador indicated that the bodies had not been located and Atlantis representatives in Colombia were told by their local contacts that the remains of the two deceased had been burned.</P>
      <P>When our Ambassador in Mexico City also became accredited to Colombia in late September, he had a meeting with a representative of Atlantis in Bogota. Since then, he has continued to liaise with Atlantis there and to support their representations to the Colombian authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Atlantis members based in Ireland decided to travel to Colombia to join their colleagues there with a view to pursuing the case, they were invited to meet with officials of my Department in advance of their departure in early December. Following this meeting, the case <Col N="153" /> was raised with the newly accredited Colombian Ambassador to Ireland, based in London. The Ambassador has since informed my Department that he has raised the case with the Colombian Vice President in his capacity as High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as with other authorities in Colombia. He confirmed that a special prosecutor of the national human rights unit is conducting an investigation, including the question of the reported release of persons imprisoned on other charges and alleged to be implicated in the Atlantis case. The Ambassador has undertaken to keep us informed of developments in the investigation. The information provided by him has already been passed to representatives of the Atlantis community. Our Ambassador in Mexico City will also continue actively to monitor the case and to maintain liaison with the Colombian authorities and with Atlantis representatives in Colombia.</P>
    <P>We will continue to do everything we can to bring comfort and closure to Tristan's family and to the Atlantis community as a whole which has been dedicated for so long to the preservation of the precious ecosystem of that beautiful but troubled country. Tristan and Javier were two of the some 25,000 people who lost their lives last year alone in the endemic violence which has afflicted Colombia for so long. That is why the EU has decided to put in place a programme of practical support for the peace process initiated by President Pastrana.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's election to the Security Council places us at the heart of the United Nations' decision-making process on issues of international peace and security. While reform issues are generally a matter for the membership of the General Assembly as a whole, we will use our position on the council to make a positive contribution to the ongoing reform agenda as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, and both the Taoiseach and I reiterated this support during our statements at the UN last September. In particular, we fully support the UN Secretary General in his efforts to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and economic development. The Millennium Summit has provided fresh impetus to the reform process. In addition, it is hoped that the agreement reached on 23 December in the United Nations Budgetary Committee on a new scale of national contributions will lead to an end to the financial crisis which has been inhibiting reform <Col N="154" /> and affecting the ability of the organisation to fulfil its charter mandate. Ireland and its EU partners participated constructively in the very difficult negotiations on the scale of contributions.</P>
    <P>While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the reorganisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, a substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area and we will continue to work with our partners and other like-minded member states to achieve progress on these issues.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a long-standing and enthusiastic participant in UN peacekeeping. The membership of the UN now needs to give the organisation the capacity to put in place well planned and resourced peacekeeping operations. The excellent Brahimi report on reform of UN peacekeeping has made a series of detailed and practical proposals in this regard. Ireland is participating actively in discussions in New York on implementation of the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues facing the UN membership generally is the question of Security Council reform. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group open to all UN member states to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the council. It is a matter of regret that the working group has not yet been able to report any substantive progress to the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, its working methods and its decision-making procedures, including, crucially, the use of the veto. Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged council of between 20 and 25 members. A significant number of other member states strongly oppose the creation of new permanent seats on the council and this has created difficulties for the open-ended working group. Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in seeking agreement on this issue.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries. In our first month of Security Council membership we have already participated in an important debate on strengthening the council's co-operation with troop contributing countries. As part of our commitment to greater transparency we have, together with the UK and France, instituted arrangements to brief the other EU member states on a weekly basis in New York on key developments in the council. This type of arrangement is mandated by Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union and we are <Col N="155" /> pleased to have been able to act quickly in this regard.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five Security Council member states, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time, any new permanent members of the council would declare that they would never exercise the veto. I assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to engage actively in all aspects of the reform agenda at the United Nations.</P>

      <Quest>the view of the Government in connection with the recent election of President Lliescu as President of Romania; the implications this result has for Romania's membership of the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>President Ion Lliescu of the Party of Romanian Social Democracy, PDSR, was elected President of Romania in the second round of the presidential election on 10 December 2000, gaining 66.83% of the vote. His opponent, Mr. Corneliu Vadim Tudor of the extreme nationalist Party of Greater Romania, PRM, won 33.17% of the vote. Mr. Lliescu was President of Romania from 1990 to 1996 and Romania's application to become a member of the EU was formally made under his earlier Presidency.</P>
      <P>Following his election, President Lliescu said that he would strive to accelerate Romania's dignified integration into the EU. On 29 December 2001 the Romanian Parliament voted confidence in the new Government of Prime Minister Adrian Nastase. The new Government, although a minority one, has a broad range of support among other parties for its policy of actively pursuing Romania's EU candidature. I understand its programme envisages economic growth of 4.5% to 6% in the period 2001 to 2004, cutting the inflation rate, a transparent privatisation process and the need to find a balance between the imperatives of a market economy and those of social protection while taking into consideration suggestions and recommendations of the EU, the IMF and the World Bank. On 27 December a number of opposition parties signed a joint declaration with the Prime Minister-elect pledging support for the Government in its efforts for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Romania's application for membership of the European Union, that country, like all other candidates, must comply with the Copenhagen criteria for membership. These criteria require that a candidate country achieves <Col N="156" /> stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. In addition, candidates must establish a functioning market economy with the capacity to cope with competitive market pressures. The current Government of Romania, in continuing to pursue membership of the EU, is, therefore, committed to the Copenhagen criteria. The EU continuously monitors the performance of candidate countries in regard to their compliance with these criteria.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Verheugen had discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr. Nastase, and his Government in the past few days on their policies for pushing ahead with the necessary reforms and adjustments to advance Romania's path to accession. Romania continues to avail of pre-accession financial assistance provided under EU programmes. Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work actively to support Romania's efforts to prepare for EU accession.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 133, 135, 217 and 269 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my concern at the assassination of President Kabila and the risk that this may pose for the establishment of a lasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the aftermath of the assassination, the international community, including the United Nations Security Council and the European Union, has appealed for calm and urged the warring parties to refrain from taking advantage of the situation to launch <Col N="157" /> new offensives. I wholeheartedly associate Ireland with that appeal.</P>
    <P>The European Union has reiterated its support for the Lusaka Agreement as providing the only consensual basis for peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the region. All parties to that Agreement must respect their commitments and comply fully with all relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</P>
    <P>The swearing in of President Joseph Kabila now provides an opportunity for the full implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and to build legitimate government. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the parties to the Lusaka Agreement immediately re-engage with a view to strict adherence to the ceasefire in all parts of the country. They must commit themselves to launching the national dialogue foreseen in the Lusaka Agreement to form the representative, democratic Government which the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo deserve.</P>
    <P>The disarmament of rebel groups and militias and a withdrawal of all belligerents from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is another urgent priority. This will facilitate the full deployment of the UN peacekeeping force authorised by Security Council Resolution 1279 of 30 November 1999 to oversee the ceasefire. For its part, the European Union is giving urgent consideration to an embargo to stem the flow of arms to the DRC and the Great Lakes region fuelling and protracting the conflict there.</P>
    <P>This is a conflict which has had a grave humanitarian impact on the people of the Congo and its neighbours. It has also had very serious economic consequences for the economic development of all the countries in the Great Lakes region. Given the appalling humanitarian conditions affecting some 16 million people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the European Commission will continue its efforts to provide aid, including humanitarian aid, to those most affected.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the initiative of the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to convene in February in New York a meeting of all signatories of the Lusaka Agreement aimed at reviving the peace process. As a member of the Security Council, Ireland will participate in this meeting and use this opportunity to urge all concerned to work towards ending this most devastating of wars and begin the process of national and regional reconciliation.</P>
    <P>An immediate cessation of hostilities in the DRC to enable the full deployment of the United Nations peacekeeping force as called for in Security Council Resolution 1291 is an urgent priority. To date, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has been unable to determine that conditions of adequate security exist in the DRC to enable United Nations forces to deploy and carry out their mandate.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1291 also expresses serious concern at reports of the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the DRC. <Col N="158" /> A panel of experts has been set up to examine these illegal activities and, on the basis of its final report which is due in March, the Security Council will examine what steps can be taken to combat such illegal activity.</P>
    <P>In accordance with resolution 1291, Ireland supports the holding at the appropriate time of an international conference on peace, security, democracy and development in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the conflict in Sierra Leone and the enormous humanitarian impact it is having on the people of the region. Although a ceasefire signed in November appears to be holding in Sierra Leone itself, recent attacks by the rebel Revolutionary United Front &ndash; RUF &ndash; on refugee camps in southern Guinea are a source of particular concern as they threaten to engulf the entire sub-region in the conflict.</P>
      <P>The Government is also concerned that revenues from the illicit trade in diamonds and arms are helping to prolong and exacerbate the conflict in Sierra Leone. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution last July expressing concern at the role played by the illicit trade in diamonds and arms in fuelling the conflict in Sierra Leone, and at reports that diamonds and arms transit neighbouring countries in contravention of existing Security Council resolutions. It requested the Secretary General to establish a panel of experts to investigate the link between trade in diamonds and trade in arms and related material. The panel of experts presented its report in December and it provides conclusive evidence that most illicit diamonds leave Sierra Leone through Liberia. The report contends that such trade cannot be conducted without involvement by Liberian Government officials at the highest level. The report also provides evidence that Liberia has been actively supporting the Revolutionary United Front at all levels. On the basis of the report's findings, the Security Council is debating the possible imposition of sanctions on the Government of Liberia.</P>
      <P>The report also contends that a number of other states in the region have been involved in the illicit trade in Sierra Leone diamonds and in supplying weapons to the Revolutionary United Front. However, the report makes no allegations against any EU member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recommends that a global certification scheme for diamonds be introduced as soon as possible. Ireland supports the introduction of such a scheme which will make it more difficult for illicit diamonds to enter the legal trade. Ireland also supports the panel's recommendation that the major trading centres for diamonds, some of which are located inside the EU, should come to an agreement on a consistent method of recording the country of origin and of <Col N="160" /> provenance of rough diamond imports to prevent conflict diamonds from being traded in their countries.</P>

      <P>As I stated in the House on 28 November last, the implementation of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports reflects progress towards strengthened co-operation and harmonisation between member states in the field of conventional arms exports.</P>
      <P>The code is a significant instrument in the area of conventional arms exports. It signals a strong political commitment to harmonisation of arms exports policies to ensure that the agreed criteria in respect of arms exports are applied consistently throughout the Union.</P>
      <P>The code has now been in force for three years. Its implementation is being strengthened through an ongoing and regular consultation process between Union partners. This process has already borne fruit. Last June, a common list of military equipment to be subjected to export controls was agreed by the partners. This was incorporated into Irish law by the Control of Exports Order, 2000. Most recently, a common list of non-military equipment to be controlled for human rights reasons has been completed in line with criterion two of the code. Two annual reports on the implementation of the code have been prepared and made public. The second report underscored the continuing evolution towards harmonisation and eventual convergence of member states arms export policies.</P>
      <P>While the code itself was not on the agenda at Nice, all questions relating to its implementation and further development are considered by the General Affairs Council as required.</P>

      <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, has closely monitored the measures taken by the Chinese Government against Falun Gong practitioners. We have expressed our concern about the situation and called on the Chinese authorities to respect the human rights of individuals. We have urged the Chinese authorities not to act against the principles contained in the UN covenants signed by China, in particular those relating to the freedoms of expression, assembly and association. We have also expressed concern about the number of arrests and the heavy sentences imposed on some members of the Falun Gong movement. These concerns also extend to heavy sentences imposed on members of the China Democratic Party and on members of Christian churches. These concerns have been expressed both bilaterally and through the EU.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 22 and 23 January, a number of decisions were taken concerning the EU-China human rights dialogue. Such dialogue is our preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation in areas of concern. It has been decided to step up the dialogue, focus it better and assess it on a continuous basis. There have been nine sessions of the dialogue since 1997, with some changes for the better in China during that period. However, I remain concerned at the lack of progress in a number of areas, in particular at the continuing widespread restrictions on freedom of assembly, expression and association, including, in the case of the Falun Gong, the violations of freedom of religion and belief, the situation of minorities, including in Tibet, and the frequent and extensive recourse to the death penalty.</P>
      <P>It has been decided to define the specific areas in which the EU will be seeking progress through the dialogue process, which includes respect for the exercise of freedom of religion and belief, both public and private, and respect for the fundamental rights of all prisoners, including those arrested for membership of the political opposition, unofficial religious movements or other movements, such as the Falun Gong.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 139 states have signed the statute and, of these, 27 have ratified it.</P>
      <P>The Government have been advised by the Attorney General that an amendment to the Constitution is required before the State may ratify the statute. The Government has accordingly authorised the drafting of a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution and, in this regard, I have asked the chairman of the Government legislation committee to arrange for the draft Bill to be given priority in the Government's current legislation programme. At a meeting held on 22 January, the Government agreed that preparations should be put in train in respect of the referendum to be held in relation to the International Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>In connection with the actual ratification process itself, apart from the need to amend the Constitution and, therefore, the need for a referendum approving such an amendment, an in-depth analysis of the statute by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform together with my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies is also necessary to determine the exact legislative and administrative measures which may need to be adopted for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under this very complex statute.</P>
      <P>Ireland and all other member states of the European Union have committed themselves to taking whatever measures are required within their respective domestic legal systems to enable them to ratify the statute expeditiously. In addition, they have called on all states to sign and ratify the statute as a matter of priority so that its entry into force can be secured at an early date. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I assure the Deputies that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

    <P>Ireland has ratified or acceded to 17 of these 25 treaties, with six of these ratifications subject to reservations. An additional six treaties or conventions have been signed by Ireland and it is intended to ratify these treaties when all necessary procedures and legislation are in place. Procedures to accede to one further convention are at a very advanced stage.</P>
    <P>The question of whether a Dáil resolution is required is usually considered in the final stages of the ratification process. The situation with regard to these 25 treaties is as follows:</P>
    <P>Human Rights</P>
    <P>1.The Convention on the Preservation and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was ratified by Ireland on 22 June 1976 with no reservations.</P>
    <P>2.The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was ratified by Ireland on 29 December 2000, subject to the following reservation-interpretative declaration:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination provides that the measures specifically described in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) shall be undertaken with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in Article 5 of the Convention. Ireland therefore considers that, through such measures, the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to peaceful assembly and association may not be jeopardised. These rights are laid down in Articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; they were reaffirmed by the General Assembly of the United Nations when it adopted Articles 19 and 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and are referred to in Article 5 (d) (viii) and (ix) of the present Convention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are no plans to withdraw this reservation.</P>
    <P>3.The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was ratified by Ireland on 8 December 1989 subject to two reservations as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" />&ldquo;Article 2, paragraph 2</P>
    <P>In the context of Government policy to foster, promote and encourage the use of the Irish language by all appropriate means, Ireland reserves the right to require, or give favourable consideration to, a knowledge of the Irish language for certain occupations.</P>
    <P>Article 13, paragraph 2 (a)</P>
    <P>Ireland recognises the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide for the education of children, and, while recognising the State's obligations to provide for free primary education and requiring that children receive a certain minimum education, nevertheless reserves the right to allow parents to provide for the education of their children in their homes provided that these minimum standards are observed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are no plans to withdraw these reservations.</P>
    <P>4.The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was ratified by Ireland on 8 December 1989, subject to the following reservations:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Article 10, paragraph 2</P>
    <P>Ireland accepts the principles referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 and implements them as far as practically possible. It reserves the right to regard full implementation of these principles as objectives to be achieved progressively.</P>
    <P>Article 14</P>
    <P>Ireland reserves the right to have minor offences against military law dealt with summarily in accordance with current procedures, which may not, in all respects, conform to the requirements of Article 14 of the Covenant.</P>
    <P>Article 19, paragraph 2</P>
    <P>Ireland reserves the right to confer a monopoly on or require the licensing of broadcasting enterprises.</P>
    <P>Article 20, paragraph 1</P>
    <P>Ireland accepts the principle in paragraph 1 of Article 20 and implements it as far as it is practicable. Having regard to the difficulties in formulating a specific offence capable of adjudication at a national level in such a form as to reflect the general principles of law recognised by the community of nations as well as the right to freedom of expression, Ireland reserves the right to postpone consideration of the possibility of introducing some legislative addition to, or variation of, existing law until such time as it may consider that such is necessary for the attainment of the objective of paragraph 1 of Article 20.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are no plans to withdraw these reservations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> 5.The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was acceded to by Ireland on 8 December 1989, subject to a reservation as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Article 5, paragraph 2</P>
    <P>Ireland does not accept the competence of the Human Rights Committee to consider a communication from an individual if the matter has already been considered under another procedure of international investigation or settlement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are no plans to withdraw this reservation.</P>
    <P>6.The Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was acceded to by Ireland on 18 June 1993 with no reservations.</P>
    <P>7.The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was acceded to by Ireland on 22 December 1985, subject to seven reservations, three of which were subsequently withdrawn. The question of retaining the remaining four reservations is under review. These four reservations are as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Articles 11 (1) and 13 (a)</P>
    <P>Ireland reserves the right to regard the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and other measures taken in implementation of the European Economic Community standards concerning employment opportunities and pay as sufficient implementation of Articles 11,1 (b), (c) and (d).</P>
    <P>Ireland reserves the right for the time being to maintain provisions of Irish legislation in the area of social security which are more favourable to women than men.</P>
    <P>Articles 13 (b) and (c)</P>
    <P>The question of supplementing the guarantee of equality contained in the Irish Constitution which special legislation governing access to financial credit and other services and recreational activities, where these are provided by private persons, organisations or enterprises, is under consideration. For the time being Ireland reserves the right to regard its existing law and measures in this area as appropriate for the attainment in Ireland of the objectives of the Convention.</P>
    <P>Articles 16, 1 (d) and (f)</P>
    <P>Ireland is of the view that the attainment in Ireland of the objectives of the Convention does not necessitate the extension to men of rights identical to those accorded by law to women in respect of the guardianship, adoption and custody of children born out of wedlock and reserves the right to implement the Convention subject to that understanding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> 8.The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was ratified by Ireland on 7 September 2000.</P>
    <P>9.The Convention against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has been signed. The recent enactment of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act, 2000, will enable Ireland to ratify the convention and it is hoped that this will take place shortly. A Dáil resolution will be required prior to accession to the convention.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform share responsibility for ratification.</P>
    <P>10.The Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified on 28 September 1992 with no reservations.</P>
    <P>11.The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on involvement of children in armed conflicts was signed by Ireland on 7 September 2000 and ratification is under consideration by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence which have responsibility for this.</P>
    <P>12.The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography was signed by Ireland on 7 September 2000 and ratification is under consideration by the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Health and Children which have responsibility for this.</P>
    <P>13.The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families has not been ratified by Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has primary responsibility. The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs also have responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>Refugees and Stateless Persons</P>
    <P>14.The Convention relating to the Status of Refugees was acceded to by Ireland on 29 November 1956 subject to the following reservations:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to Article 17 the Government of Ireland do not undertake to grant to refugees rights of wage-earning employment more favourable than those granted to aliens generally.</P>
    <P>The Government of Ireland undertake to give effect to Article 25 only in so far as may be practicable and permissible under the laws of Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to Article 29(1) the Government of Ireland do not undertake to accord to refugees treatment more favourable than that accorded to aliens <Col N="169" /> generally with respect to: Income Tax (including Surtax).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are no plans to withdraw these reservations.</P>
    <P>Penal Matters</P>
    <P>15.The Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel has not yet been acceded to by Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have responsibility for accession to this convention. The legislation necessary to give effect to the provisions of the convention in Irish law, the Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Act, 2000, was signed by the President on 28 June 2000. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will prepare a motion for the Dáil to approve accession to the convention.</P>
    <P>16.The International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings was signed by Ireland on 29 May 1998 but has not yet been ratified.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are responsible for ratification. It is intended to ratify this convention when all necessary procedures and legislation are in place.</P>
    <P>17.The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court has been signed but not ratified by Ireland. Ratification is, however, a high priority for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform bear primary responsibility for ratification. The Constitution will have to be amended if Ireland is to ratify the statute. The Department of Foreign Affairs has asked the parliamentary counsel to the Government to draft the necessary legislation. Implementing legislation, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will also be required. The issue of Dáil approval will be dealt with prior to ratification.</P>
    <P>Disarmament</P>
    <P>18.The Convention on Prohibition or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects (and Protocols) was ratified by Ireland on 13 March 1995. Ireland is also bound by the three protocols and there are no reservations.</P>
    <P>19.Ireland is bound by the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices as amended on 3 May 1996 (with amended Protocol II) since 27 March 1997. There are no reservations.</P>

    <P>22.The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction was ratified on 3 December 1997 and there are no reservations.</P>
    <P>Environment</P>
    <P>23.The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by Ireland, with all other EU member states and the European Community on 29 April 1998. Arrangements for ratification will be made in conjunction with ratification by the European Community and its member states and it is expected that this joint ratification will be facilitated by agreement on a number of matters at a resumed sixth Conference of the Parties to the Convention likely to take place in May 2001.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has the primary role in preparations for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The Departments of Finance, Public Enterprise, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Marine and Natural Resources and Foreign Affairs also have significant responsibilities in relation to the requirements of the protocol.</P>
    <P>24.The Convention on Biological Diversity was ratified on 22 March 1996 with no reservations.</P>

These discussions are coming to a conclusion and I hope to be in a position to deposit the instrument of ratification with the Council of Europe at an early date.</P>
      <P>Protocol 12 was opened for signature on the occasion of the commemoration ceremonies for the 50th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights on 3 and 4 November 2000. The protocol was signed, subject to ratification, by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on that occasion. The question of the ratification of this protocol will be a matter for discussion with the relevant Departments in the coming months. I cannot at this stage anticipate when we will be in a position to ratify the protocol, but I will be anxious to ensure that this is done as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In June 1997 the Commission for Racial Equality in Britain published a report on &ldquo;Discrimination and the Irish Community in Britain&rdquo; which concluded that there was &ldquo;a widespread, and almost completely unquestioned, acceptance of anti-Irish racism in British society&rdquo;. The report drew attention to discrimination in a number of areas and contained recommendations to Government agencies, statutory bodies, voluntary agencies and private companies in Britain about addressing this situation.</P>
      <P>Through the Irish Embassy in London we are encouraging action by British Government bodies and voluntary Irish organisations to follow through on the recommendations in the report. The British authorities are as anxious as we are to eliminate anti-Irish prejudice or racism.</P>
      <P>Complaints of racist treatment and-or harassment by public authorities such as police, prison and immigration officers are occasionally received from Irish people residing in or visiting Britain. Precise statistics are not kept but the incidence of such complaints has diminished in recent years. Where it receives evidence of serious anti-Irish prejudice or discrimination, the Irish Embassy brings complaints to the attention of the public bodies involved. Complainants are informed of the legal redress options available to them under the British Race Relations Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints arising from the experiences of Irish passengers at British ports and airports mostly relate to the operation within Britain of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Government has frequently expressed to the British authorities our concerns regarding the operation of provisions of the PTA, such as the powers relating to port and border controls, the application of which has a disproportionate impact on persons travelling between the two islands. Complaints made to us about specific instances of the <Col N="173" /> use of these powers are also raised with the British authorities through the embassy in London.</P>

      <P>The condition of prisons and the situation of prisoners in Turkey have been a source of concern for some time. Last October a number of prisoners initiated a hunger strike in some 20 Turkish prisons to protest against proposed changes in their accommodation arrangements. New cell type prisons, know as F-type, have been constructed to accommodate one to four inmates per cell and replace dormitory-style accommodation currently prevalent in Turkish prisons. The prisoners claimed they feared that the proposed changes would leave them more vulnerable to mistreatment. The Turkish authorities stressed their intention was to regain control over the prisons in which, they claimed, gangs held sway and had succeeded in accumulating arsenals. Turkey also stressed its intention to upgrade and modernise the prison system.</P>
      <P>On 19 December, following unsuccessful efforts at mediation, the Turkish authorities intervened to transfer prisoners to the F-type prisons and to try to end the hunger strikes. The operation resulted in a number of deaths and serious injuries among both the prisoners and the security forces. Ireland deeply regrets the tragic loss of life and our concerns have been conveyed to the Turkish authorities.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe's committee for the prevention of torture visited Turkey at the invitation of the Turkish authorities to inspect the F-type prisons in July of last year and again in December and earlier this month. It is understood that the committee is in ongoing contact with the Turkish authorities concerning the prison situation, including the issue of F-type accommodation and the recent tragic events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union has stressed the need for serious reform in the prison system in the situation of prisoners and in regard to human rights in Turkey in general. Ireland together with partners in the EU is following the issue of prisons and the situation of prisoners in Turkey with the closest attention and has made clear to Turkey that it is <Col N="174" /> ready to offer every possible assistance to help it achieve concrete improvements in this crucial matter.</P>

      <P>Following the major volcanic eruption which led to the evacuation of the population of the British Territory of Montserrat in 1997, that country has been seeking to develop the relatively safe northern part of the island to make it suitable for the entire population. Over the past three years, the British Government has funded a massive development effort to achieve this objective with more than £75 million sterling having been spent to date. Apart from the basic needs of housing <Col N="175" /> and sanitation, advances have also been made in restoring health and educational facilities. Current efforts are aimed primarily at the restoration of the country's economic infrastructure to enable those who fled the volcano and who have not yet returned to come back to sustainable livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Last October, the Chief Minister of Montserrat, Mr. David S. Brandt, led a visiting delegation in Dublin which gave briefings on the current situation to officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the National Software Directorate and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. This itinerary reflects the focus of the Montserrat authorities on rebuilding the tourism sector and on attracting new industries in the e-commerce and information technology sectors to reinvigorate the economy and to create greater employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>In November, a technical assistance proposal to carry out a study to support the development of the Montserrat tourism sector, which has in the past contributed between 20 and 36 per cent of the country's GDP, was received by the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. This was a direct follow-up to the Chief Minister's visit. In December, following examination of the proposal, a number of observations on its possible advancement were conveyed to the Montserrat authorities by my Department. The response of the Montserrat authorities to these observations is now awaited.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the tourism study proposal is, therefore, ongoing. As such, it is one of the options for possible technical assistance to Montserrat which were discussed with the Chief Minister, Mr. Brandt, in a spirit of positive co-operation when he visited Dublin in October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>It was important that the Nice European Council sent a positive message to the candidate countries that their difficult reform programmes would be rewarded by membership of the European Union in the near future. The greatest reassurance which could be given was the successful conclusion of the intergovernmental conference, which has now paved the way for enlargement to begin. For further information on the treaty agreed at Nice, I refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to Question No. 87.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the enlargement negotiations themselves, the Nice European Council endorsed the Commission's strategy paper, which includes an indicative road map for accession negotiations over the coming 18 months. On the basis of the <Col N="176" /> decisions at Nice, we can now make a substantive leap forward in the negotiations. The Swedish Presidency, in its ambitious programme of work for enlargement, has shown that it is determined to maintain and add further to the momentum of Nice. Ireland is anxious to play its full part in the success of this programme of work and looks forward to a positive review of enlargement at the European Council in Gothenburg in June.</P>
    <P>
      <i>ESDP</i>On European security and defence policy, the European Council approved a Presidency report on progress made in establishing an EU capability to undertake crisis management tasks. The mandate for this report was given by the European Council in Feira, and its scope embraces the implementation of the decisions reached at Helsinki, supplemented by the further decisions of the Feira European Council in June. Annexes to the report cover permanent structures for ESDP, civil crisis management, the outcome of the capabilities commitment conference, EU-NATO relations and relations with third countries. The Council took note of contributions from the Secretary General/High Representative concerning both conflict prevention and a framework for crisis management. Conflict prevention has been listed as a particular priority of the current Swedish Presidency.</P>
    <P>We consider the progress made to be satisfactory and we are pleased that the report itself took substantial account of Irish views and concerns. For example, considerable emphasis has been given to the role of the UN, to the principles of the UN Charter, including a reference to the UN Security Council and to recent contacts between Kofi Annan and the EU, and to the role which the EU could play in support of the UN and the OSCE.</P>
    <P>The focus in ESDP is clearly on peacekeeping and crisis management, that is, the Petersberg tasks. These developments, on which I have reported regularly to the House, do not represent the creation of a European Army, nor is any mutual defence commitment involved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Treaty Change</i>As the basis of the current work on ESDP is the Amsterdam Treaty, in common with the great majority of our partners, we took the view that it was neither necessary nor desirable to undertake a substantial revision of the relevant provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty at Nice.</P>
    <P>In view of the developments on ESDP, there was merit in updating and tidying those relevant provisions of the treaty which had become redundant or outdated. This has been done in the case of two articles in a way which does not change or expand their scope.</P>
    <P>In Article 17 there has been agreement to remove clauses on the Western European Union, including the possibility that Western European Union could be integrated as a whole into the EU. We see this as representing a positive development as the EU had already agreed to <Col N="177" /> take over the Petersberg task responsibilities of the Western European Union. In the case of Article 25, there is an adjustment to reflect the agreement at Helsinki that the political and security committee, under the authority of the Council, will assume the functions of the existing political committee.</P>
    <P>To reflect the fact that treaty amendment is not legally necessary, a declaration has been agreed which indicates that the EU's capabilities in this area do not depend on the new treaty.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Enhanced Co-operation in the Second Pillar</i>Enhanced co-operation or flexibility has been agreed as a procedure which could apply in the common foreign and security policy, subject to unanimity in the decision establishing the group and involvement by a minimum of eight countries. It does not, however, apply to the security and defence area.</P>
    <P>While we have questioned the need for such a provision, our main concern was to exclude its application from security and defence matters. There is already sufficient scope for member states to choose whether or not to be involved in Petersberg tasks or in co-operation on such tasks without the added layers of enhanced co-operation which could have the effect of fragmenting the EU's approach.</P>

      <P>The European Union has constantly played a very active role in supporting efforts to bring about a comprehensive and lasting settlement in the Middle East. In particular, the EU strongly encourages the various initiatives to end the current violence and urges the parties to pursue the path of negotiation and to make the necessary compromises to resolve outstanding problems. The active part taken by High Representative, Javier Solana, and Special Envoy, Miguel Moratinos, in their contacts with all the major participants demonstrates the EU's commitment to assist in mediation efforts to resolve the conflict. The EU Presidency, with Solana and Moratinos, was in continuous contact with the parties over the weekend on possible follow-up to the Taba talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Affairs Council in Brussels last week expressed its full support for the talks in Taba, urging both sides to continue to strive for <Col N="178" /> an end to violence and to continue their negotiations for an agreement in the framework of UN Security Council resolutions. We hope that the progress made in the talks can be built upon to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region.</P>
    <P>Given the grave economic difficulties faced by the Palestinian Authority, the EU has called on Israel to end immediately the withholding of revenue payments due to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the remaining closures. The EU has also sought to address these difficulties by creating a special cash facility totalling 90 million euros to fund open-ended loans to the Palestinian Authority to bridge these revenue payments withheld by Israel. The EU is the major aid contributor to the Palestinian Authority with a budget of almost 156 million euros for the year 2000.</P>
    <P>For an agreement to take hold and to endure, it is essential to rebuild trust. This will not be easy but it is vital for lasting success. We, with our EU partners, have supported the fact-finding commission agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh, on which the EU High Representative, Javier Solana, represents the European Union. We see the commission, which intends to return to the occupied territories on 16 February, as a significant confidence building measure agreed by both sides. In this regard we are concerned that Israel has suspended co-operation with the commission's technical staff, and would urge it to fully re-engage with the work of the commission. The EU Presidency will press the Israeli authorities to co-operate with the commission.</P>
    <P>The EU will work closely with the Bush Administration and expects the US to continue the central role played by former President Clinton. It is important that we in the EU and in the wider international community are ready to cement in place any agreement that may emerge from the current negotiations. We hope that, if such an agreement can be reached, it will command the decisive support of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.</P>

In February 2000 a person in Britain was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act, 1998 &ndash; not the Race Relations Act &ndash; with racially aggravated harassment of an Irish citizen. However, that charge was dropped before the matter came to court in April 2000 when the accused pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of harassment under the same Act. He was fined £750, had to pay costs of £50 and a one year order was made restraining the individual concerned from engaging in conduct which would amount to harassment of the victim. The case was brought by the Crown Prosecution Service following a complaint to the police by the Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>In cases where serious racially motivated harassment comes to the attention of the Irish Embassy in London &ndash; and the case which gave rise to the Deputy's question was not one of them &ndash; Irish citizens are advised of the legal redress options available to them under the Race Relations Act. They are also advised to report the offences to the police and/or to the Commission for Racial Equality. It is then a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether charges should be brought and under what legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I attach the utmost importance to promoting foreign earnings and inward investment to Ireland. This is one of the highest priorities for my Department and for Ireland's diplomatic missions abroad.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the Department's commitment and role in advancing our economic interests overseas. Our diplomatic missions, with their high level access and wide range of contacts in the economic and commercial policy areas, are uniquely placed to identify and explore economic opportunities for Ireland. The Department's export promotion activity includes food products as well as industrial goods, and is particularly important in countries where no other official Irish representation exists.</P>
      <P>In countries where the import of beef products is controlled by the central administration, prompt and effective diplomatic contact with government officials and trade representatives locally can be a critical factor in securing and maintaining access to those markets.</P>
      <P>My officials work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and with An Bord Bia in seeking new market opportunities and, especially at this time, in attempting to secure re-entry to those markets where temporary restrictions have been imposed on the import of beef as a result of the current BSE crisis in the EU. Our main non-EU markets, where temporary import restrictions are now in force, include Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and a number of other countries in the Middle East and Gulf region. An import restriction has also been imposed on Irish beef products in the Philippines, an important new market in Asia.</P>
      <P>Import restrictions on Irish beef products arising from the BSE crisis have had a severely damaging impact on the Irish beef industry at all levels, from producers to exporters. The estimated annual loss to exporters as a result of the recent closure of certain markets is of the order of £450 million. It is important to stress that these restrictions apply to beef imports from the EU generally and are not directed specifically at Ireland, although Irish exports have suffered in consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and our missions abroad are actively engaged in the task of trying to have these restrictions lifted. We have provided our ambassadors with comprehensive briefing material on BSE which emphasises the stringent controls which are in place in Ireland to combat the disease. I have no doubt that these restrictions will be lifted. In the period ahead, a key objective for the Government and for my Department will be to ensure that, when they are <Col N="181" /> removed, we will be in a position to recover swiftly our traditional markets. My Department will be a key player in achieving that goal.</P>

      <P>On the general issue of the US trade embargo against Cuba, I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 86</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific point regarding the UN Security Council, it must be recalled that the embargo against Cuba is a unilateral one imposed by the United States. The United Nations itself has not imposed sanctions against Cuba and, therefore, the Security Council does not have a direct role in addressing the matter. Cuba has not itself sought the council's active involvement and has chosen instead to pursue the matter in the General Assembly. The United States, as a permanent member of the Security Council, holds veto power over decisions of the council. Should Cuba decide that the way forward is to try to engage SECCO on the issue, we will, as a member of the council, consider the matter very carefully. The Government remains committed to finding, together with our EU partners, practical ways to remedy the current situation and we will lose no opportunity to do so.</P>

This further step in the weaponization of nuclear weapons in south Asia presages the unleashing of a nuclear arms race in the region. Such a development militates against the prospects of achieving nuclear disarmament. These prospects have been recently enhanced on foot of the new agenda initiative and the new commitment to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons secured from the five nuclear weapon states by the new agenda states at the 2000 NPT review conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of Ireland's involvement in the development of European security and defence policy, the Government has consistently made clear to this House and to our European partners that Ireland will approach proposals for specific crisis management missions on a case by case basis and will only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by relevant Irish legislation. Other EU member states, including Finland and Sweden, also attach great importance to UN authorisation for any potential EU operation.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify any confusion arising from the description of the capabilities for the EU headline goal as a &ldquo;Rapid Reaction Force&rdquo; and on the question of UN authorisation for the work on capabilities under way. The response capacity being developed by the EU, and frequently described as a rapid reaction force, is emphatically not a standing army. Rather it constitutes a catalogue of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out Petersberg tasks &ndash; tasks of crisis management, peacekeeping and humanitarian activities &ndash; the national elements of which can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor. The question of a UN mandate for identifying, developing and organising these capabilities does not arise.</P>
      <P>In contributing to the development of European security and defence policy, we and other EU member states have made every effort to ensure that the role of the UN is fully recognised. From a political point of view, we hope very much that any decision relating to the deployment of forces by the EU would be in the framework of UN decisions. In the event of an EU crisis management operation arising outside this framework, the relevant Irish legislation is clear and would preclude the involvement of Irish military personnel or equipment.</P>
      <P>Overall, the EU is strengthening its relations with the UN, particularly in regard to European security and defence policy. It has been clearly recognised in the conclusions of several European Councils, most recently at Nice, that EU and UN processes should be mutually reinforcing. I also point out that UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan, has welcomed the development of EU crisis management capabilities and that discussions on how the two organisations might co-operate are getting under way. I also understand that the UN Secretary General is to meet with EU Foreign Ministers in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when the UN increasingly looks to regional organisations to undertake peace support operations on its behalf, it is critical that <Col N="183" /> Ireland should support efforts at EU level to give effect to the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>

      <P>The last ten years have seen many traumatic events in the western Balkans, with ethnically-motivated violence often being perpetrated by individuals and groups on their vulnerable neighbours. In the aftermath of such events, a truth and reconciliation commission can have a valuable role to play in promoting reconciliation and establishing a good basis for future harmonious living together. Whether such a body can replace due process of the criminal law is for each country to decide in the light of its own particular circumstances and aspirations. However, at the international level, there can be no substitute for legal accountability before a court of law. In 1993, the UN Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, established the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991. This tribunal remains the appropriate forum for trial of such offences and I expect the authorities in Belgrade to co-operate fully with it in fulfilling its mandate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concerned to learn of the oil tanker accident which took place off the Galapagos Islands some two weeks ago. The accident had potentially grave consequences for the fragile ecosystem of the islands which form an internationally renowned nature preserve and sustain unique species of marine, animal and plant life.</P>
      <P>The intensive clean-up operation mounted by the Ecuadorian authorities with international support has made substantial progress and the risk of a major environmental disaster has reportedly been averted. It is, however, too early to say what the long-term impact of this regrettable accident will be.</P>
      <P>Experts from the European Union who are specialists in the field of marine pollution are contributing to the clean-up effort. Their task is to help minimise the impact of the pollution and ensure the recovery of affected areas of the islands. The Commission's decision to despatch experts to the scene is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>There has been no request for assistance from Ireland arising from the accident. In the past two years we have provided development assistance funding for projects in Ecuador to the amount of £85,000. Some £50,000 was allocated towards the building of a small hospital facility and £35,000 for the provision of skills-training in a disadvantaged region of the country.</P>
      <P>In recent years Ecuador has struggled to consolidate its political stability in the face of its considerable economic vulnerability, particularly its exposure to sharp swings in commodity prices. There is considerable political and public opposition to the government's economic reform programme. In recent weeks this has resulted in mass marches by students, teachers, trade unions and indigenous groups to protest against steep increases in fuel prices and transport charges. Some of the recent marches have culminated in violent clashes with police and military resulting in a number of serious injuries. It is to be hoped that the Government of President Noboa will be able to stabilise the political situation and to proceed with its political and economic programme with full respect for the human rights of those who oppose it.</P>
      <P>The volume of trade between Ireland and Ecuador is modest. The most recent full year figures are for 1999 and value Irish exports at £2.1 million. Imports from Ecuador amounted to £441,000. The main commodities exported were oils, perfumes, chemicals, dairy products and industrial machinery. Imports included oils, perfumes, fish and crude animal and vegetable materials. Full year statistics for last year will, when available, show an increase in trade. By October last our exports had reached £4.3 million while imports stood at £486,000.</P>

      <P>As of 1 January 2001 Ireland was owed approximately £7.9 million for the cost of providing Irish personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. The missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, UNTAET. Continuous efforts are made by my Department to recover moneys owed from the United Nations. During 2000 Ireland received approximately £9.1 million in arrears.</P>
      <P>The financial crisis which has hindered the UN from paying outstanding moneys is a direct result of past failures by many member states, in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This situation has resulted in a serious day to day UN cash flow problem. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US has been the major debtor and I therefore welcome the agreement reached by the budgetary committee of the UN in December which significantly improves the arrears situation. Following the agreement, which, <i>inter alia</i>, reduces the US share of both the regular and peacekeeping budgets, the US Administration, with congressional approval, will now repay over $800 million of arrears to the organisation. It is hoped that this agreement will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to troop-con<Col N="186" /> tributing countries, including Ireland. In the meantime, I assure the Deputy that Ireland's permanent mission to the UN in New York will continue to actively pursue the outstanding amounts of arrears.</P>

      <P>In May 2000 an analysis by the Department of the Environment and Local Government suggested that the number of new dwelling units for which permission had been granted in 1999 and the first quarter of 2000 was considerably understated in the statistics compiled by the CSO from returns made by the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> A review of the series was undertaken to cover the year 1999 and the first two quarters of the year 2000. This was done by asking each local authority and An Bord Pleanála to submit for the periods involved a total for the number of final grants of planning permission in respect of new dwellings, and showing separately the total number of houses and apartments involved. This return was to be certified as accurate by a senior manager in the planning authority concerned.</P>
    <P>To ensure that all such permissions were included and that there was no double counting of permissions which had been appealed, a detailed set of guidelines for the review system was drawn up by the CSO in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and An Bord Pleanála. Subsequently, it was decided to compile data for the <Col N="189" /> third quarter of 2000 using the same approach applied in the review and to draw up revised guidelines to apply from the fourth quarter of 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> The returns are now almost complete for 1999 and the first two quarters of 2000 and estimates are shown in the table below. It is hoped to publish the final figures before the end of February.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The main e-mail address for my Department, which is posted on the front page of its website, is webmaster@taoiseach.irlgov.ie. For communications relating to the strategic management initiative SMI and the public service modernisation programme, there is a special e-mail address, bettergov@taoiseach.irlgov.ie, posted on the bettergov website &ndash; www.bettergov.ie.</P>
      <P>In general, my Department strives to ensure that all e-mails to the Department are replied to as quickly as possible and in accordance with the quality customer service standards for my Department. As part of these standards, my Department aims to provide a substantive response to 70% of correspondence within 15 working days of receipt. Where it is not possible to issue a full reply within 15 working days, it is my Department's policy to advise the correspondent as to when it will be possible to issue such a response.</P>
      <P>In the last quarter of 2000, 5,809 e-mails were received by the webmaster e-mail address. The majority of these, 3,859, were in the form of open letters, campaigns, public comment and advertisement and did not require individual responses. Of the remaining 1,950, a response was generally given on the same day except where the query necessitated additional research.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy requires further information in relation to the processing of a specific e-mail inquiry, I will be happy to pursue this matter further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government action plan, Implementing the Information Society in Ireland, is the blueprint for the development and encouragement of e-government. A copy of the action plan, together with progress reports on its implementation, can be obtained at my Department's website at www.irlgov.ie/taoiseach/eIreland/intro. htm.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to its publication, the e-Europe action plan has been published, information society commitments have been given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and the public services broker model has been launched. Consequently, my Department is examining the possibility of producing a composite action plan taking account of developments to date and the Government's activity in relation to e-government, including the strategies for the electronic delivery of services being developed by each Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of my Department, the following major initiatives are under way to promote the information society and the development of e-government: the e-Cabinet project &ndash; the e-Cabinet project was approved by Government in April 2000 and PricewaterhouseCoopers has been retained as consultant for phase 1 of the project to develop recommendations on the shape of an <Col N="192" /> e-Cabinet model; engagement of an external facilitator to assist the cross-departmental development of strategies for the electronic delivery of information and services &ndash; Departments were mandated to produce electronic delivery strategies by December 2000 and following on from this, further work will be undertaken, using an external facilitator, with a view to developing an e-delivery strategy for the public service in the context of the public service broker; further development of the social partners extranet &ndash; this extranet, the first such public service one to include other than public servants, is part of the monitoring and implementation process of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and proposed enhancements in 2001 include some interactive capabilities, a statistical database and access to an archive of documents of interest to social partners; research will be undertaken in the area of e-service delivery methods and user interaction with electronically enabled agencies; resourcing of the information society policy unit in my Department to further develop policies for e-government and the information society generally.</P>
    <P>In excess of £50 million is being provided this year to fund information society initiatives. An allocation for initiatives being sponsored by my Department is under discussion and is likely to be of the order of £2 million.</P>
    <P>Consideration is being given to the reconstitution of the information society commission in the light of the recommendations of the outgoing commission. I expect to bring proposals to Government in this regard shortly.</P>

      <P>The CPI is designed to measure inflation. To do this accurately it must reflect the change in the average prices paid to purchase consumer goods and services in market transactions. Tobacco represents 4.8% of the expenditure measured by the CPI and clearly needs to be included if an accurate measure of inflation is to be achieved. This is consistent with standard international practice.</P>
      <P>The Irish CPI is compiled by the Central Statistics Office, CSO. Under the Statistics Act, 1993, the director general of the CSO has sole responsibility for and is independent in deciding the statistical methodology and professional standards to be used. To facilitate users, the CSO publishes a sub-index excluding tobacco. This allows users to choose or reach a consensus on the most appropriate index to use for specific purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the public should send e-mail queries relating to my Department to Webmaster@entemp.ie, which is the address posted on the Department's website. Alternatively, certain <Col N="201" /> units of my Department have individual addresses indicated in the relevant area of the website, and where the query is of a specific nature, it can be addressed directly to the unit concerned. My Department replies to all e-mail queries and has the following arrangements in place to deal with them.</P>
    <P>All e-mails to the Webmaster receive an automatic acknowledgement. Routine e-mails are responded to directly by the Webmaster within three working days of receipt. E-mails requiring research are dealt with in the same manner as conventional correspondence and are, where necessary, referred for reply to the relevant section within my Department. In these instances, the Webmaster informs the correspondent within two working days that his or her query has been sent to a named official within my Department for direct reply.</P>
    <P>While response times will vary depending on the nature and complexity of the query, every effort is made to provide a prompt response. If there is going to be a delay, it is the policy of my Department under its customer service plan to issue an interim reply explaining the position. These standards apply to all officials within my Department, whether e-mailed directly or indirectly through the Webmaster.</P>
    <P>In the last quarter of 2000 the Webmaster received 676 e-mail queries, all of which have been responded to as described above. Records are not collated regarding the number of e-mails addressed to specific units or individuals.</P>
    <P>In the framework of the Government's action plan on implementing the information society and the delivery of a quality service to my Department's customers, I have made the on-line and timely delivery of services, of which e-mail is a constituent part, an integral part of my Department's strategy over the coming three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, was the first Minister to introduce national minimum wage legislation to tackle the issue of low pay. The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, came into force on 1 April 2000 and the national minimum hourly rate of pay has been set at £4.40. An ESRI impact study published in June 1999 estimated that 163,000 employees, particularly women and young workers, would benefit from the introduction of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> The Tánaiste has signed an order to increase the national minimum hourly rate of pay to £4.70 from 1 July 2001 and to £5 from 1 October 2002, as recommended in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In addition to increasing the national minimum wage, the Government continues to improve the position of the low-paid through tax reform and tax reductions and it is committed to removing employees earning the national minimum wage from the tax net. Substantial progress towards this objective has already been achieved.</P>
    <P>The joint labour committee system continues to operate in certain sectors of the economy and employment regulation orders stipulate statutory minimum pay and conditions of employment for workers employed in those sectors. Employment regulation orders are made by the Labour Court, following consideration of the proposals formulated by the relevant joint labour committee. Employment regulation orders, therefore, provide important statutory protection for many thousands of workers over and above the national minimum wage legislation. Apart from statutory minimum pay, low paid employees also benefit from the pay terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, including the recent adjustment to the pay terms.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the position of low paid employees has improved and will continue to improve arising from statutory minimum pay, the pay terms of the national agreement, tax reform and tax reductions.</P>

      <Quest> the actions she will take to reduce the problem of bullying in the workplace; if she has considered changes to labour law in respect of allowing bullying as a legitimate reason in proving a case of constructive unfair dismissal; the discussions she has had with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The issue of workplace bullying is being examined by a task force on the prevention of workplace bullying which I established and which is operating under the auspices of the Health and Safety Authority. The task force is focusing on identifying the size of the problem and the employment sectors most at risk as well as developing proposals for practical programmes and strategies, both to prevent workplace bullying and to provide a more appropriate co-ordinated response from the relevant State agencies.</P>
      <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is represented on the task force and is, therefore, in a position to contribute fully to its deliberations. I have had informal discussions with it on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the report of the <Col N="203" /> task force, and any recommendations made thereon, in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 and 1993, the termination by an employee of his or her contract of employment with his or her employer, in the manner described in the Act, because of the conduct of the employer, may be regarded as a dismissal for the purposes of the Act. It is not necessary, therefore, to amend the Act to enable a claim to be brought on such grounds.</P>

      <P>Job losses are due, in many cases, to the restructuring process which is ongoing in industry in Ireland, whereby activities at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context. While job losses are regrettable, they must be seen in the context of overall strong economic growth, declining unemployment and sustained employment expansion throughout the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has a crucial role to play in the development of the information society. Electronic government is an opportunity to take advantage of the increased productivity, reduced costs and improved customer responsiveness that can be achieved by using these new technologies. E-government will also enhance the business community's and the citizen's access to government information and services and speed up standard administrative processes. It can also provide new ways to increase citizen participation in the democratic process.</P>
      <P>An e-government strategy has been drawn up by my Department as part of its strategy statement for the years 2001 to 2003. This e-government strategy is in keeping with the principles laid down in the Government's action plan on implementing the information society in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As an integral part of my Department's aim to deliver a quality customer service, we will ensure the on-line delivery of our services is customer focused and offers a speedy, low cost and accessible option for our customers who wish to interact with the Department through the Internet. Information on all of the services provided by the Department is available on our website which can be accessed at www.entemp.ie. We also recognise that the traditional means of communication will continue to be a feature of customer service in my Department.</P>
      <P>The targets set for the delivery of these on-line public services will be within the timeframe of 2002, envisaged in the e-Europe action plan and agreed by the European Council at Feira in June 2000. To expedite this process my Department has engaged an external facilitator to prepare a report that will identify and prioritise those services to be delivered electronically. The report will also detail the human, financial and technological resources required to deliver our services electronically. The study will be completed by end February 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's on-line services will form a major part of the reach project's government portal which is being developed as a comprehensive on-line service for all interactions with Government. Our on-line service to business will be accessible through the basis project which my Department is responsible for developing under the information society action plan. The basis project arises from a commitment by all levels of Government to improve the compliance processes that affect business in Ireland and make it easier for business to deal with government. The delivery of information and services will be based <Col N="205" /> around the events of a business such as starting a business, employing staff, accessing funding or registering a company. The development of the BASIS application is scheduled to start in February 2001 with the implementation of the first module scheduled for May 2001.</P>

While it was originally envisaged that the task force would report in March of last year, I have been advised by the chairman of the task force that it has not yet completed its deliberations.

The discussions with the Department of Education and Science relate to the transfer of funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes to that Department. The proposed transfer would provide an increase in funding for schools over and above the additional resources already allocated by the Department of Education and Science for schools support services over the past year and would provide a uniform and equitable system of funding for schools services which would, thereafter, be solely the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Motor insurance underwriting criteria are normally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint and the premiums charged would reflect any material increase in the risk. Increasing use of technology is being made by insurers in segmenting risk categories into more discrete groupings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high level of compensation claims for personal injuries sustained in road accidents and the high cost of such claims prevents motor insurers from minimising their insurance premiums. Because personal injury claims constitute a greater proportion of claims made by Irish policyholders, the cost of claims to Irish motor insurers is proportionately higher than in other EU member states. Another contributor to the costs <Col N="208" /> incurred by motor insurers is the level of uninsured driving and the claims which arise following accidents caused by uninsured drivers. These claims are paid by motor insurers.</P>
    <P>EU law prevents us from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Discussions have taken place between my Department and the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, on the issue of motor insurance for elderly drivers on many occasions and it accepts that motor underwriting criteria are sometimes not flexible enough to take account of individual circumstances. Each underwriting risk, however, must be considered in the overall context of providing protection to all insured drivers.</P>
    <P>The motor insurance advisory board will advise me on the contributory factors to the high level of premium charges for motor insurance and the methods for providing motor insurance between different risk categories of drivers, with regard to accidents and claims.</P>

      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, came into force on 1 April 2000 and set the national minimum hourly rate of pay at £4.40. Lower hourly rates apply in certain circumstances and <Col N="210" /> for a defined period only. The Act provides that certain payments, if earned by an employee, are reckonable when determining if the employee has been paid his or her minimum hourly rate of pay entitlement. The reckonable pay components are listed in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Act, which includes piece rate payments that are productivity related. An employer must ensure, therefore, an employee, who is employed on a piece rate system, is paid at least his or her statutory minimum hourly rate of pay entitlement for the hours worked by the employee in a pay reference period.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has no powers under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, to regulate piece rates. Complaints concerning an alleged under-payment of an employee's statutory minimum hourly rate of pay can be made to the labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, 65a Adelaide Road, Dublin 2. The telephone number is (01) 6312121 or Lo-call 1890 220222.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent press reports regarding alleged mistreatment of immigrant workers. The protections of Irish labour law apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as to native Irish workers. The labour inspectorate of my Department has an ongoing responsibility for monitoring the employment conditions of various categories of vulnerable workers, including immigrant workers. Any instances of apparent abuse of foreign workers should be brought to the attention of the inspectorate. These complaints will be investigated and where there is evidence that immigrant workers are being denied any entitlements under the various employee protection Acts, such action, including prosecution, as is necessary will be taken to ensure the employers concerned comply with the law.</P>

      <P>On 11 January 2001, the company announced the closure of its plant in Ballina. The reasons for the closure are that the plant is not profitable and the business is not core to the parent company. The Ballina plant has suffered from under-investment, loss of markets, price erosion, poor product mix and high logistic costs. It was particularly vulnerable to increases in labour costs. The first redundancies are due to commence in February 2001.</P>
      <P>Since the closure announcement, FÁS has been in contact with the general manager of the company on a number of occasions. A FÁS team has been established to assist those being made redundant in guidance and career counselling, in matching for job vacancies and by providing training courses, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland is also working with the company in attempting to get a suitable project for the Ballina facility. The company is still in operation and operations are to be phased out in coming months. In the meantime, the company has provided the IDA with a building specification of the <Col N="212" /> plant and a skills inventory of the workforce, with a view to securing a replacement industry.</P>
    <P>The IDA and other State agencies have been asked to actively promote Ballina as a location for new investment, particularly bearing in mind that there is a period of some months before the company fully closes. The availability of a prime facility and a highly committed workforce will be a strong attraction for potential investors.</P>
    <P>The IDA has radically changed its policies in the past 18 months with the objective of delivering 50% of all new jobs from greenfield projects into the Border, midlands and west region in the period to the end of 2002. Results for 2000 are ahead of expectations compared to the three year target set out at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>The north Mayo enterprise initiative has been asked to examine the implications of the company's closure and to include its findings in the final report.</P>

      <P>Within the past 12 months, there were two separate occasions on which e-mail security in my Department was breached. In both cases, which were of an identical nature, the breaches involved external sources using my Department's mail server as a conduit to relay unsolicited information exter<Col N="213" /> nally. This practice is commonly known as spamming. This practice means that external e-mail users were successful in using our mail server to relay spam e-mails to a large number of users outside the Department. In effect, from the recipients' perspective, the mail thus generated appeared to originate from my Department, although this was not the case.</P>
      <P>My Department took immediate action to redress this situation in terms of reconfiguring our mail server to prevent open relay of e-mails and taking additional precautionary measures to further secure our mail routing facility. I am satisfied that these measures will protect the integrity of my Department's mail system. My Department is constantly monitoring and reviewing security on all its key systems to ensure their continued security.</P>

I have been informed by the South Western Regional Fisheries Board that the person in question was not granted a licence in the year 2000 because he did not fall within any of the eligible categories provided for under section 4(2) of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1980.

      <P>The PESCA Community initiative was designed to assist the fisheries sector to diversify from traditional fishing activities and support alternative activities most suited to fishermen, their families and fishing communities. In all, 195 projects were approved for funding under this initiative, with 81% of allocated funding paid out on claims to date. The deadline for commencement of the audit of the programme is the end of June 2001 and all payments under the PESCA initiative will be made in advance of this date.</P>
      <P>Full payments on the majority of projects have already been completed. Final payments on approximately 30 projects are with BIM for processing and should be completed by 31 March 2001. Two projects are due for completion by 30 April 2001. The PESCA quality officers programme is due for completion by June 2001. Two projects involving the purchase of vessels are due for completion by the end of February 2001. In relation to both projects, all commitments made under their approvals will be met, subject to receipt of complete audited claims, by 31 March 2001.</P>

      <P>Last summer I commissioned O'Hare and Associates to undertake a full assessment of the existing infrastructure and onshore facilities at Rossaveel Fishery Harbour Centre in <Col N="216" /> terms of meeting the existing and future requirements of the fishing industry, tourism, commercial traffic and the social and economic fabric of the region. The study is now complete and in line with its recommended options on current and future infrastructural needs at the harbour, I have given the go-ahead to progress the project as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The report recommends a phased development. Phase 1 provides for the upgrading of existing facilities as well as the provision of a dedicated ferry berth with a 100m wharf and water depth of 3m. Included also in phase 1 is additional dredging in the harbour area and navigation channel. Phase 1 cost is estimated at £4.857 million.</P>
      <P>Phase 2 involves the provision of a deepwater berth and breakwater to service the needs of larger fishing vessels and additional traffic. The estimated cost of phase 2 is £9.927 million giving a total cost of some £14.8 million.</P>
      <P>The upgrading work and the detailed pre-planning, technical and engineering design for the development phase is getting under way with a view to tangible progress this year.</P>

      <P>As I stated in the final part of my reply to the question put by the Deputy on 22 March last, the issue of whether to proceed with the application, which will have to be accompanied by a new EIS, lies with Dublin Port Company. No such EIS has as yet been submitted to my Department. Should the company produce a new EIS a fresh public consultation period and process will commence. Objections and observations, if any, should be in relation to the proposal as outlined in the new EIS. Submissions and objections to the proposal as outlined in the original EIS, which the Deputy will be aware failed to meet with statutory requirements, cannot be considered in the context of a new public consultation process. In the event that I grant permission under section 10 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, which I can only refuse on the grounds of adverse effects on the environment, fishing and-or navigation, planning permission will be required before any reclamation can commence.</P>

      <P>I approved the granting of a foreshore lease to Cork County Council for the proposed works on 11 August 2000 and the matter was referred to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for completion on 28 August 2000. The solicitor charged with acting on my Department's behalf forwarded a draft lease for approval by my Department's officials on 24 January 2001 and an engrossed lease was forwarded for execution to Cork County Council on 25 January 2001. Upon return of the executed lease from the council arrangements will be made to finalise the matter.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of the mussel <Col N="222" /> fisheries at Castlemaine Harbour last December to review their current difficulties. The £2.5 million shellfish remedial package announced recently is being administered by BIM. The objective of the scheme is to provide financial aid to assist rope mussel producers who have experienced difficulties due to biotoxin closures with a once-off environmental clean-up of redundant stock and to restore and secure production capability for the future. The package will assist producers to overcome difficulties which have impacted badly on the rope mussel sector, in particular. Applications which meet the eligibility criteria for the scheme are under consideration by BIM.</P>
      <P>In the context of available funding, I have requested BIM to meet representatives of the Castlemaine mussel fishermen to determine how best to alleviate the impact of quantified losses suffered by them as a result of prolonged closures due to biotoxins and seed losses due to storms.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 257 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the major increases in the Irish Government's programme of development co-operation, as committed by the Taoiseach at the millennium summit, the role of NGOs is being strengthened. This is manifested by increased levels of funding. The provisional outturn for the aid programme in 2000 is approximately £210 million, of which £138 million is under the direct control of Ireland Aid through the Department of Foreign Affairs. NGOs received approximately £19 million directly from the Department. In addition, we estimate that approximately £8.35 million was dispersed to NGOs <i>via </i>APSO and NCDE, both of which are directly funded by Ireland Aid. Therefore, a total of £27.35 million was allocated to NGOs which represents almost 20% of the funds under direct Ireland Aid control for expenditure purposes. A number of Irish NGOs also receive funds from multilateral agencies such as the UN and the EU to which the Irish Government contributes from its development co-operation budget.</P>
      <P>I agree that the provision for NGOs in Vote 39 should be explicitly published as part of the Estimates. Accordingly, in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2001 to be published next month, a breakdown of subhead A, which covers the bilateral aid programme, should show how much has been provided in block grant assistance, in the main co-financing scheme and in the local co-financing scheme. I am confident the publication of this information will contribute to the growing openness in the management of the aid programme and highlight the developing partnership between the programme and NGOs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 52 of 28 November, the involvement of NATO in European security and defence policy stems from the fact that the EU, which is not a military organisation, is likely to remain dependent on NATO infrastructural and transport capacity.</P>
      <P>The EU has therefore been working with NATO on co-operative arrangements to ensure that access to NATO assets and capabilities would be facilitated in the event of an EU operation needing to use them. The involvement of NATO, in a co-ordinating and planning capacity, would take place against this background. Principles agreed at the Feira European Council concerning EU-NATO relations specified that there should be full respect for the autonomy of EU decision making, recognition of the different nature of the EU and NATO and no discrimination against any of the member states. These principles are fully reflected in the documents approved by the Nice European Council.</P>
      <P>The comments to which the Deputy refers were made at a recent meeting of NATO Defence Ministers and, in the context of internal debate within NATO, underlined concerns on the part of certain NATO members that the EU should not set up a separate operational planning capability. However, such remarks should also be seen in the context of the principles on EU-NATO relations agreed by the EU at the European Council at Feira and now confirmed by Nice. We attach particular importance to maintaining the principle of decision making autonomy in any co-operation arrangements between the EU and NATO.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that the command arrangements for any EU led operation would ultimately be a matter for the EU to decide. The EU would maintain political control of any operation using NATO assets and capabilities. Moreover, Irish involvement in any EU crisis management operations would be subject to Government decision on a case by case basis and would only occur where there is a UN mandate and approval by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Population Fund &ndash; UNFPA &ndash; extends assistance to developing countries at <Col N="228" /> their request to help them address reproductive health and population issues. UNFPA is committed by its mandates to the principles of voluntarism. All its programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its guiding policy, as laid down by its Governing Council in 1985, stipulates that UNFPA is &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Ireland has raised with UNFPA allegations relating to supposed support for China's one child policy. UNFPA has given assurances that it does not support this policy. The fund has a voluntary reproductive health and family planning programme in China. This programme operates in the 32 counties where the government of China has suspended its one child policy.</P>
      <P>Allegations concerning coerced sterilisation by the Peruvian authorities led to the formation in August 1997 of an independent investigative commission which included representatives of the women's groups that had reported the abuses. In February 1999, after investigating the charges, the commission, in a statement of consensus, found that reports of a &ldquo;massive and coercive sterilisation programme in Peru&rdquo; were erroneous and did not reflect the reality of the programme. The Ministry of Health, in an evaluation requested by the commission, had acknowledged that there were cases of Government abuses relating to programme targets, poor quality of services, insufficient counselling to ensure full information and informed choice and a lack of patient follow-up. The Ministry, with UNFPA's support, is implementing a series of measures to guarantee principles of free and informed choice and to improve quality of care.</P>
      <P>Far from supporting forced sterilisation in Peru, UNFPA has been instrumental in ensuring that it adheres to the 1994 Cairo international conference on population and development principles of free and informed consent. Those critical of the UNFPA programme may confuse UNFPA activities with policies or alleged policies pursued by countries such as China and Peru. The assumption sometimes made is that UNFPA, because of its co-operation with government authorities, implicitly endorses the coercive aspects of policies espoused by those authorities. The Department of Foreign Affairs can find no evidence to support this argument.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that half a million women in the developing world die each year due to pregnancy related causes and that 350 million women have no access to any form of contraception. Ireland Aid has been making annual voluntary contributions to UNFPA since 1993. The money provided by Ireland Aid contributes to UNFPA's efforts, saves the lives of thousands of women each year and helps prevent hundreds of thousands of unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has just completed a three year term on the executive board of UNFPA. Through its <Col N="229" /> membership of the board, Ireland was able to participate directly in detailed donor discussions on UNFPA's programmes and be in a position to closely monitor UNFPA's performance. Ireland has not ever described its position on the executive board of UNFPA as &ldquo;honorary&rdquo;. We assumed our position on foot of the regular rotation of donor representatives. The whole point of such a position is to participate actively in policy debate concerning the present and future orientations of the agency in question. At a session of UNFPA's executive board in New York in 1999, the UNFPA programme in Peru was raised with Ireland's support. Membership of the board thus ensures that we have an opportunity to present our views on the operation and performance of the UN agencies and to raise queries on specific issues.</P>
    <P>The Department has a sufficient body of information available to it from these sources on which to form an accurate assessment of UNFPA's operations. On the basis of that information, and in the light of specific and repeated assurances from UNFPA, I am satisfied that its operations are conducted in full accordance with the principles of voluntarism.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of people living abroad who are entitled to Irish citizenship, as distinct from the number who actually are Irish citizens. Entitlement to citizenship under Irish law is generous by comparison with citizenship law in other countries. It includes people married to Irish citizens for at least three years and grandchildren, and in some cases great-grandchildren, of people born in Ireland. There is no way of knowing in advance whether people entitled to Irish citizenship through marriage or by descent will choose to exercise that entitlement.</P>
      <P>Of the total of about 2.7 million passports issued by the passport offices in Ireland and by Irish embassies and consulates abroad in the past ten years and currently in circulation, we estimate about 700,000 were issued by Irish embassies and consulates abroad. About 430,000 were issued by the embassy in London and about 270,000 by other missions.</P>
      <P>A rough estimate of the total number of Irish citizens abroad who were born in Ireland is 1.2 million.</P>

      <P>The personal and social welfare of Irish citizens living overseas is of primary concern to all officers employed in our missions overseas. While the ambassador and most embassy staff abroad at various times and in different ways contribute to the needs of the Irish community in their area I could not state that they are devoted exclusively or primarily to their welfare.</P>
      <P>The role of staff in embassies abroad is varied. Generally, in each mission abroad the junior diplomatic officer, usually at third secretary grade, and one locally recruited member of staff deal with consular matters concerning Irish citizens on the ground. Diplomatic staff respond not only to their consular needs but also maintain regular contact with Irish community organisations. They encourage and support social and cultural activities by the Irish community, provide hospitality to representatives of the Irish community and monitor and respond to the changing needs and priorities of the Irish community within their areas.</P>
      <P>In Britain, however, where there is a large Irish community, there are three officers &ndash; one assistant principal-first secretary, one third secretary and one higher executive officer &ndash; who are primarily assigned to the personal and social welfare of Irish citizens in Britain. In addition, there are two clerical officers who work exclusively with Irish citizens on specific requirements in the consular area and two executive officers who spend a significant amount of time devoted to consular matters. There is also a fully operational passport office in London which issues 40,000 passports annually.</P>
      <P>A large proportion of the time of the consulates-general in Cardiff, Edinburgh, New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and Sydney &ndash; one first secretary, one third secretary and two to three support staff in each &ndash; is also devoted to servicing the needs of the Irish communities and individual citizens in their areas of responsibility. In addition, the Department has a network of 66 honorary consuls in 48 countries whose prime responsibility relates to the consular needs of Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>A 1999 report for the Catholic Bishops' Commission for Emigrants about the planning of services for Irish emigrants drew attention to what they regarded as shortcomings in Government policy making in this area. The commission commented that the interdepartmental committee on emigration has interpreted its terms of reference in a minimalist way. My Department and the Government accept that there is a good case for a pro-active approach to address the ongoing needs of Irish emigrants, particularly the elderly who have been abroad for a long period and those young people who still propose to emigrate.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government is committed to establish a task force to develop a coherent long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs. I am in the process of selecting members of the task force and setting terms of reference. Proposals will be put to Government in the coming weeks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>About 880 Irish citizens have been convicted and are serving sentences abroad; five of them <Col N="232" /> are in non-OECD countries where Ireland has no direct diplomatic representation; two of those five also have British citizenship and one of them has opted for the consular protection of the British authorities, the UK having a bilateral prisoner transfer agreement with the country where he is imprisoned.</P>
    <P>I understand these five Irish prisoners have to pay for toiletries and-or personal hygiene prerequisites and that they do so with funds provided by relatives or friends or by a voluntary organisation such as one in Britain which is financially supported by the UK Government. At the moment no source of funds is available to my Department from which to assist Irish prisoners abroad in that way. I have asked that the possibility of assisting Irish prisoners in non-OECD countries to purchase toiletries and to pay for basic medical and dental treatment be examined by my Department in consultation with other Departments and voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>In its &ldquo;Validation, Implementation and Review&rdquo; section, the agreement puts in place review mechanisms to address difficulties which may arise in different circumstances. It states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Each institution may, at any time, review any problems that may arise in its operation..;</P>
    <P>If there are difficulties in the operation of a particular institution, which have implications for another institution, they may review their operations separately and jointly..;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>If difficulties arise which require remedial action across the range of institutions, or otherwise require amendment of the British-Irish Agreement or relevant legislation, the process of review will fall to the two Governments in consultation with the parties in the Assembly.</P>
    <P>The institutions themselves can initiate a review to address difficulties arising in their own operation. In the case of difficulties arising across a range of institutions, it falls to the two Governments to put the process of review into effect.</P>
    <P>Since the restoration of the operation of the Executive and Assembly last May, I have not discussed these matters with the British Government. The Deputy may also wish to be aware that in their statement issued at Hillsborough on 5 May 2000, the two Governments stated:</P>
    <P>If difficulties arise in the implementation of the Agreement (for example, the IICD reports that it does not believe that arms will be put beyond use, or the institutions are not operating in good faith as envisaged in the Agreement), the two Governments will, in consultation with the Assembly and the Executive, carry out an immediate formal review under the terms of the Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been 24 meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council since its inception on 2 December 1999. Following is a full list of these <Col N="234" /> meetings. Two of them have been in the plenary format &ndash; at Armagh on 13 December 1999 and in Dublin on 26 September 2000. The remaining 22 meetings have been in what is called the sectoral format of the Council. There are 12 sectors in all, each of them covering one of the 12 areas agreed in the Good Friday Agreement and in the subsequent negotiations between the two Governments and the Northern Ireland parties, as constituting the remit of the Council. At the inaugural plenary meeting in Armagh in December 1999, it was agreed that the Council would meet in sectoral format to consider issues relating to: Implementation Bodies &ndash; Waterways Ireland; Food Safety Promotion Board; Special EU Programmes Body; North/South Language Body; Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission; Trade and Business Development Body. Areas for co-operation are transport, agriculture, education, health, environment and tourism.</P>
      <P>The work of all these sectors is now well under way and the Government is pleased with the solid progress made. The NSMC itself is working well and the Government is very encouraged by the positive spirit in which all of the meetings have taken place. The Government regrets that, due to the action mandated by the Ulster Unionist Council on 28 October 2000, it has not been possible to hold NSMC meetings in the education and health/food safety formats since that date.</P>
      <P>The Implementation Bodies are up and running and the process of appointing permanent chief executives and other staff is well advanced. The new all-island tourism company, Tourism Ireland, has also been established. The Government believes these institutions have a critically important role to play in the development of co-operation between North and South, to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island. That is why it attaches such importance to the resolution of the remaining difficulties, concerning the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, so that the North-South institutions can proceed on a fully inclusive basis and discharge their very real potential for the benefit of all of the people on this island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has closely followed developments in human rights in Peru and, together with our partners in the European Union, we have been active in articulating our concerns both directly to the Peruvian authorities in Lima and in appropriate international fora.</P>
      <P>At the last session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March-April 2000, Ireland was fully associated with a statement on Peru made by the Portuguese EU Presidency on behalf of the Union as a whole. The statement on Peru expressed the Union's concern about practices there which seriously undermine the separation of powers, the lack of due process particularly where military penal courts of justice are concerned, disrespect for procedural guarantees, harassment of human rights defenders, of journalists and opposition political leaders, extra-judicial executions and torture and appalling conditions in detention centres. It also deplored the July 1999 withdrawal by Peru from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which weakened the protection of the individual guarantees afforded by that regional system for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>However, the turbulent events of recent months culminating in the resignation on 19 November last of President Fujimori, the selection of Valentin Paniagua, the former congressional president, as Fujimori's interim successor, and his appointment of Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations Secretary-General, as Prime Minister, have raised hopes of a significant improvement in the political and human rights situation in the country. Mr. Paniagua further underlined his democratic credentials by calling early presidential elections for 8 April next. The Congress has underscored its commitment to human rights by its decision on 12 January to return Peru to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will closely follow the progress of the situation in Peru as it develops, including through <Col N="236" /> our embassy in Mexico City which is now accredited to Lima. Together with our EU partners, we will continue to stress to Peru the importance of full respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. In addition, we have nominated three observers as candidates for participation in the EU election observation mission which will monitor the forthcoming presidential elections.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific issue of allegations of coercive sterilisation of Peruvian women, I refer the Deputy to the reply given to Question No. 220.</P>

Of these, 15 are from the North and 12 are from the South. An additional two posts from the South have been sanctioned by the Government and are in the process of being filled.</P>
      <P>The role of the standing joint secretariat is to facilitate the operation of the North-South Ministerial Council. It also has responsibility for monitoring the implementation of decisions of the Council and, in that capacity, liaises closely with the relevant Departments, North and South, with the all-island Implementation Bodies and with the new all-island tourism company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of institutions across the three strands of the negotiations dealing with relations within Northern Ireland, between North and South on the island and between these islands. These institutions came into force on 2 December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the first year of operation of the North-South Ministerial Council has concluded, preparation of its first annual report is currently being undertaken by its joint secretariat in Armagh. The draft report will subsequently be submitted to the North-South Ministerial Council for approval and adoption. I intend that this report, once adopted by the North-South Ministerial <Col N="239" /> Council, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Each of the six all-island Implementation Bodies is required to submit a report on its activities in each year to the North-South Ministerial Council &ldquo;at such date and in such form as NSMC may direct.&rdquo;  Now that the first year of operation of the all-island Implementation Bodies has been completed, arrangements are being made for each body to submit a report of its activities for that period to the North-South Ministerial Council. These reports will then be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
    <P>After each meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, a joint communiqué is published which provides a comprehensive summary of the discussions at that meeting and the decisions taken. This communiqué is distributed to the media and I am arranging that, in each case, copies will, henceforward, be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Ministers are also reporting regularly to the House on North-South business by means of parliamentary questions in their specific areas of responsibility. Given the newness of the institutions, the Government is willing to keep under review how best to ensure the Oireachtas is fully informed of the progress and operations of the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
    <P>The membership of the British-Irish Council comprises representatives of the British and Irish Governments, devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales together with representatives of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the full membership of the British-Irish Council will keep under review the workings of the Council, including a formal published review at an appropriate time after the agreement comes into effect. In line with the Good Friday Agreement, members of the British-Irish Council will operate in accordance with whatever procedures for democratic authority and accountability are in force in their respective elected institutions, including in relation to reporting procedures.</P>
    <P>At its next summit meeting, members of the British-Irish Council will report on progress in those areas of work in which they have taken a lead role. This includes transport &ndash; Northern Ireland, social inclusion &ndash; Scotland and Wales, knowledge economy &ndash; Jersey and environment  &ndash; UK. The subject matter of the summit will be drugs, the area for which the Irish Government has taken the lead.</P>
    <P>A communiqué will be distributed to the media and I am arranging that copies will be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>My Department has requested a total of £400,000 for these initiatives in 2001 which represents the initial phases of these projects and is made up of allocations from the administrative budget and the information society fund. Arrangements for the draw down of funds from the information society are currently the subject of discussions with the Department of Finance. It is expected that these projects will require further funding in future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>The Security Council has, under the Charter of the United Nations, primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and the member states agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. It is the Security Council which mandates all UN peace support missions. Ireland's national approach to peace and security has always been based on the key role of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time, the Security Council examines broad issues which have a specific development dimension. It has, for example, considered the global impact of HIV-AIDS on three occasions in the past year. The last such dis<Col N="241" /> cussion was held earlier this month during which Ireland made an intervention. However, the day-to-day running of the UN funds and programmes and the policy considerations underpinning their operation is the responsibility of the agencies' respective executive boards rather than of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland has just completed a three year term on the executive boards of the UN development programme, UNDP, the largest UN development body, and the UN population fund, UNFPA. Ireland was vice-president of the UNDP bureau in 1999. During our term on the boards we were actively involved in policy debate concerning the present and future orientations of these two key agencies. In particular, Ireland used its position to support the process of reform proposed by the UN Secretary General aimed at making UN aid programmes more effective. Over the past two years, the UN development group, consisting of all the principal UN development agencies, has been established to facilitate co-ordination. UN development assistance frameworks have been introduced at field level, again to improve co-ordination. Staff have been decentralised from HQ to the field and bureaucracy has been streamlined. UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF have also adopted results based budgeting which emphasises outputs and outcomes. We will continue to monitor and encourage this process as observers on the boards.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a permanent member of the executive committee of UN High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, which is based in Geneva, and will become a board member of UNICEF in 2002. Participation in the boards will ensure that we continue to have an opportunity to influence the operation, performance and reform of these agencies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241, 276 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>There is a strong interest in developing and building on the good relations between Ireland and Brazil. While there are no immediate plans to open a resident embassy in Brazil the matter is being kept under active and regular review, having regard to the availability of the necessary resources. Most of our EU partners have a diplomatic presence in Brazil.</P>
      <P>Ireland has in recent years accelerated its programme for the opening of embassies in states with which it has or aims to have increased trade, economic and political relations. Since 1998, for example, new diplomatic missions at embassy and consulate general level have been opened in Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America, as follows: embassies in Ankara, 1998; Mexico, 1999; Singapore, 2000; Oslo, 2000 and consulates general in Cardiff, 1998; Edinburgh, 1998; Shanghai, 2000; Sydney, 2000. It is hoped to continue this programme of opening embassies in states with which Ireland has growing trade relations over the coming years as resources permit.</P>
      <P>Ireland maintains an embassy in each one of the EU member states. Of the EU applicant states, Ireland already has embassies in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Turkey. It is proposed to continue a phased expansion of diplomatic representation in the remaining applicant countries over a number of years on a priority basis and having regard to the likely timing of EU membership.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 274 together.</P>
      <P>The human rights situation in Algeria continues to be a serious cause of concern. The internal security situation has been marked by an alarming increase in killings, particularly over the Moslem holy month of Ramadan. These outbreaks of blood letting both violate human rights and jeopardise the programme of national reconciliation. The Government wants to see the Algerian people finally emerge from the violence they have suffered for so long. We are strongly encouraging all efforts towards the achievement of that goal.</P>
      <P>In ongoing discussions with our EU partners on this issue we have emphasised the need for a constructive dialogue with Algeria. In this context the EU has encouraged key reforms, including modernisation and improvements in human rights, and has funded constructive assistance through the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. In the dialogue, Ireland has sought to maintain a strong focus on human rights and the promotion of the role of civil society. The dialogue is conducted under the Barcelona Declaration of November 1995, whose aim is to lead to a strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights, sustainable and balanced economic and social development, measures to combat poverty and promotion of greater understanding between cultures. We would also hope to see a constructive dialogue within Algeria between the government and the opposition to make greater progress towards a more inclusive society.</P>
      <P>Algeria's membership of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership can make a valuable contribution towards the ending of civil conflict in that country. Each partner country has made specific commitments under the declaration to act in accordance with the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The partnership also commits states to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. This is one of its fundamental pillars and we expect to see that these commitments are fully implemented in practice. The EU has also sought information from the Algerian Government on specific disappearance cases. The Algerian authorities responded to these <i>démarches</i> last year furnishing partial information to the EU Presidency on some cases. The EU is to seek clarification of this information. Ireland sees this as part of an ongoing process, and has passed on information on further cases to the EU Presidency for further <i>démarches</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union welcomed the outcome of the referendum in September 1999 in which the Algerian people endorsed a vision of national peace and reconciliation. The amnesty introduced by President Bouteflika is a positive step. At this <Col N="244" /> stage, further steps are clearly necessary, and it is essential that all groups work for reconciliation and security in the country.</P>

      <P>The Government fully supports the efforts of the United Nations to advance the process towards a political settlement in Cyprus in the current round of talks between both sides. In November 1999, Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash agreed to take part in UN sponsored indirect talks with Cypriot President Glafeos Clerides and talks took place from 3 to 14 December. A second round was held from 31 January to 8 February 2000 and resumed in Geneva on 5 July. Following a brief adjournment from 12 to 24 July they ran until 4 August. The fourth round took place in New York from 12 September for two weeks and a fifth round took place from 1-11 November in Geneva. The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, personally participated in the November round of talks and is currently engaged in ongoing contacts with both sides with a view to being able to schedule a further round at an early date.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the talks is to prepare the groundwork for comprehensive negotiations between both sides. Four core issues are on the table in the discussions &ndash; security, property rights, institutional structures and territorial boundaries. The issues are complex and highly sensitive for all parties.</P>
      <P>The Government has been following developments in relation to the Cyprus issue with the closest attention and has urged the parties to make every effort to move the process forward. Ireland has a particular interest in a successful outcome to the talks process. We have contributed from the outset to the UN peacekeeping operation in Cyprus and currently have some 20 personnel in UNFICYP. During his recent visit to the region the Taoiseach had detailed discussions on the Cyprus issue with President Clerides and with the UN Secretary General's deputy representative for Cyprus, Mr. Wlosowicz. The Government has made clear to all the parties involved in the Cyprus issue and to the United Nations that as a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland is ready to provide every assistance possible which could be considered useful in helping to promote the search for a political solution in Cyprus.</P>

      <P>The Czech Republic has made substantial progress in its negotiations and preparations for EU membership. Like all of the &ldquo;Luxembourg candidates&rdquo;, which began negotiations in 1998, the Czech Republic has opened all chapters for negotiations with the exception of the institutions chapter. Of those 29 chapters opened, the Czech Republic has completed negotiations provisionally in 13 chapters. The successful completion of the Intergovernmental Conference, and the decisions at the Nice European Council on enlargement, have added considerable momentum to the negotiation process, which should see substantive progress by the Czech Republic together with the other candidates in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Commission's enlargement strategy, which was endorsed by the Nice European Council, an indicative programme of work for negotiations has been proposed for the coming 18 <Col N="246" /> months. Chapters likely for progress under the Swedish Presidency include free movement of persons, freedom to provide services, free movement of capital, company law, culture and audio-visual policy, social policy and employment and environment. At this stage, it would not be possible to give precise dates for any candidate's actual accession. However, the Nice European Council reiterated the objective that the EU would be in a position to welcome new member states which are ready from the end of 2002. In addition, the Nice European Council expressed the hope that these countries would be able to take part in the next European Parliament elections in 2004.</P>

      <P>During Ireland's EU Presidency in 1996, the EU adopted a common position on Burma which introduced certain restrictive measures against the military regime in Burma. Since then the common position has been kept under ongoing review and added to in the light of circumstances. The most recent strengthening of the common position took place in April 2000. The next review will take place in April of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review will take into account, <i>inter alia</i>, the report of the UN Secretary General's special envoy, Ismail Razali, who visited Burma earlier <Col N="247" /> this month. While I understand Mr. Razali has indicated that talks have taken place between the National League for Democracy, NLD, and the military regime, the full significance of these is not clear and further information, including the views of Aung San Suu Kyi on their importance or relevance, will have to be taken into account before a proper evaluation of the present situation can be made.</P>
    <P>An EU troika is currently visiting Burma and is expected to have meetings with several key parties. Its report on the visit will also be central to the review of the common position, although the key factors determining the outcome of the review will be the actual conditions and situation in Burma and the prospects for change.</P>
    <P>The EU will also present a resolution on the situation in Burma at the forthcoming 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March. Its precise terms, too, will have to take account of any developments in the situation. Against this background, I intend to keep the situation in Burma under close review and to press for carefully measured and targeted adjustments in the EU common position as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 279 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the Dáil on 28 November 2000, the Government is deeply concerned about the ongoing deterioration of the human rights situation in Afghanistan. The Government strongly condemns the discrimination against women practised by the Taliban. Ireland takes every opportunity, including through the United Nations and the EU, to exert pressure on the Taliban to end their discriminatory practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners have repeatedly called on the Taliban and other Afghan factions to respect basic human rights and to end gender discrimination. The EU common position on Afghanistan was renewed and strengthened last <Col N="248" /> week, on 24 January. At Ireland's initiative, the revised common position strengthens the EU's opposition to discrimination against women in Afghanistan. In addition, one of the EU's stated objectives in Afghanistan is now to work towards the creation of an environment in which gender discrimination does not hamper the distribution of humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>EU concerns about the continuing grave violations of human rights in Afghanistan were made known at the UN Commission on Human Rights last year and will be raised again at the next session in March. A resolution at the most recent session of the UN General Assembly in New York, which had the full support of Ireland, also condemned human rights violations in Afghanistan, including the persistent human rights violations against women and girls. The UN Security Council further introduced increased sanctions against the Taliban on 13 December 2000, which provide for measures such as the closure of Taliban offices around the world and the banning of flights to Taliban controlled areas, with the exception of humanitarian flights. Ireland fully supports these sanctions.</P>
    <P>Despite the combined and strenuous efforts of the international community, the situation in Afghanistan is one of the most intractable human rights problems facing the international community at present. I assure the House that the Government and the international community will continue to make every effort to ameliorate the humanitarian and human rights situation in the country, in particular in relation to discrimination against women.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he accepts that the problem of AIDS is particularly serious in Africa; if he will indicate the countries worst affected; his views on whether the non-availability of medicines is a particular difficulty; and the steps he is taking to assist in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The HIV-AIDS pandemic is probably the greatest challenge to development and progress on the continent of Africa. Latest figures show that there are now almost 25 million Africans living with the disease. An estimated 22 million people have died of the disease to date. These frightening statistics illustrate the extent to which HIV-AIDS has pervaded every sector of society in Africa and wiped out decades of steady improvement in life expectancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa HIV-AIDS is now responsible for the deaths of seven out of ten people in the young adult age group. This has hugely important economic and social implications for these countries as it is this important population sub-group who contribute to the economic development of a society and <Col N="249" /> who are responsible for the upbringing and welfare of young families.</P>
    <P>Among the African countries worst effected are South Africa, where life expectancy is expected to fall to 45 years by 2005, Zambia, where life expectancy has declined from 60 years to 40 years in the past ten years, and Botswana, where it is estimated that two thirds of young boys under 15 years will die prematurely of AIDS. It is a sad fact that those countries that have the heaviest burden of HIV infection are often those with the least capacity to respond to it. Across Africa, most governments simply cannot afford to supply basic palliative medications, let alone more expensive anti-viral treatments.</P>
    <P>In my view the non-availability of medications for HIV-AIDS in Africa is a particular difficulty. The problem is more extensive than this, however. Access to medicines is only one component of a comprehensive package of care to which every person infected with HIV-AIDS is entitled. We have a responsibility to work towards redressing this situation and have a substantial opportunity to do so in the context of the expansion of the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem and the way in which it has undermined development progress, requires a response that is urgent, resourced, focused and sustained. The need to respond in such a manner and to support HIV-AIDS interventions has been well recognised by Ireland Aid. In January 2000, the Minister of State launched a new &ldquo;HIV/AIDS Strategy for the Ireland Aid Programme&rdquo;. Clearly the availability of additional resources coupled with the publication of this strategy will allow Ireland Aid to continue to respond in a substantive and coherent manner.</P>
    <P>Over the past year we have taken a number of steps to respond to the global HIV-AIDS pandemic. At international level the Taoiseach has pressed for higher priority for the problem of HIV-AIDS in developing countries. Following his visit to Lesotho and South Africa last January, the Taoiseach wrote to the President of the European Commission to request that HIV-AIDS be afforded far greater priority in the development aid programme of the European Union.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, has also lobbied tirelessly on this issue. At EU Development Council meetings she has urged the EU to show greater global leadership in the fight against HIV-AIDS. Partly in response to these pressures, the European Union has recently adopted a strategy for accelerated action against HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases. In a wider international context, the special UN session on AIDS scheduled for next June will serve to galvanise international efforts to respond to the AIDS pandemic.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ireland Aid, international advocacy has been complemented by the allocation of increased financial resources for HIV-AIDS activities. Over the last year, substantial new grant allocations were made to UNAIDS, the World Health Organisation, and the international <Col N="250" /> AIDS vaccine initiative. Several other such programmes are currently under consideration. In addition, new resources were made available for HIV-AIDS programmes in the priority countries for Ireland Aid. These are being implemented by both Government and non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that these efforts are in addition to Ireland Aid support for the development and improvement on health services in all of our priority countries. Last year alone, over IR£11 million was allocated for health service improvements in these situations. I assure the Deputy that our Government will continue to afford the highest priority to supporting efforts to halt the spread of AIDS and to provide support for those suffering from this disease in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ireland Aid programme for East Timor is currently centred upon two main priority areas which remain of fundamental importance, namely, to support rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in the areas of shelter, basic education and the re-establishment of the agriculture sector, and to support the development of democratic institutions with a focus on the justice sector.</P>
      <P>Within this remit, the Government has contributed a total of £1,897,000 to East and West Timor since September 1999. During 1999, a total of £650,000 in humanitarian assistance was provided. In 2000, a further £1,247,000 was granted. In addition to supporting the relevant UN and World Bank trust funds for East Timor, this aid is also supporting the work of Irish NGOs in the field. This current year, the Government is committed to providing a further £2 million in bilateral support for East Timor. Further increases are envisaged as part of the process of working towards a full bilateral development assistance programme. In a practical way, these efforts reflect the path Ireland has taken in supporting meaningful democratic change for the benefit of the people of East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While East Timor is currently working towards national elections and the formal declaration of independence later this year, it is clear that the country will be in a state of transition on the political, economic and social levels for the foreseeable future. At the same time, it must be recognised that the situation in the country is moving into a new phase of self-government which will, because of the dearth of infrastructure, require <Col N="251" /> ongoing outside assistance to create the desired capacities.</P>
    <P>The Ireland Aid programme in East Timor is thus going to continue to be implemented in a context of national transition. This is, in a number of key areas, not so much a transition but, more fundamentally, a nation building exercise. The country's colonial legacy has deprived it of an indigenous administrative capacity which means that several initial steps will be required before the traditional form of country programme can be fully implemented. A key challenge for Ireland Aid and other donors will be to ensure that any expansion of our programmes in East Timor is reflected in a growth in those local capacities needed to make them happen.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid is therefore taking the necessary preparatory steps towards that goal. A programme officer for Ireland Aid was appointed last year and is working in Dili where an office is being established. In support of this appointment, an Ireland Aid mission visited Dili and the Oecussi enclave in late November. The mission had a series of meetings with key members of the transitional administration and cabinet, including in the local administration, health, agriculture, education, gender affairs and human rights areas. Taking account of the continued lack of basic administrative structures and the uneven development across key sectors which was evident at that time, an incremental and phased approach is now being taken. This is intended to help ensure that any new bilateral country programme can come to reflect sectoral needs and be implemented by Ireland Aid with lasting effect and in a co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>Initially, Ireland Aid support will continue to be given to our existing priority areas as well as to the forthcoming electoral process, civic education and the building of civil society. The continuing need to address the very basic needs on the ground will also be addressed through the implementation of quick impact programmes. We will maintain our working partnership with the World Bank and UN trust funds which are continuing to give assistance to the health, education, agriculture, community, social and economic sectors while at the same time seeking to improve the rate of programme delivery. In addressing current needs, Ireland Aid will build on its cumulative working experience to formalise a full bilateral assistance programme for East Timor within the next two years which will include more substantially district and sector based elements.</P>

      <P>The response of the international community to the crisis in Mozambique resulting from the cyclones and flooding of February-March last year was centred on short-term emergency relief in response to the appeal of the Government of Mozambique for $1,000 million to meet immediate needs and medium-term rehabilitation assistance based on the appeal at the international reconstruction conference for Mozambique held in Rome on 3 and 4 May 2000 in which the Government of Mozambique sought US$449.5 million in international support for its reconstruction programme. Both of these financing targets were met by the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the immediate £700,000 emergency relief provided by Ireland, a further IR£1.6 million was reallocated from the budget for long-term development projects in Mozambique to meet short-term needs arising from the emergency. Furthermore, an amount of IR£4.5 million was pledged by Ireland at the international donor <Col N="253" /> conference held in Rome last May for the reconstruction process. A total of IR£1.7 million of this amount was designated for payment to the debt alleviation fund established by the Mozambican Government to assist in relieving the burden of debt on the country. The remaining IR£2.8 million is being used for the rehabilitation of roads washed away in the flood affected province of Inhambane where Ireland has had a development programme since 1996.</P>
    <P>The emergency phase, involving assistance to those affected to return to their normal life by, for example, providing housing materials, seeds and farming implements, concluded in August 2000. The reconstruction phase, using the funds raised at the conference in Rome, is expected to last until the end of 2001. The Government of Mozambique is determined that the infrastructure damaged by the floods must be restored and, equally importantly, that preventive measures be taken to mitigate the effects of any future natural disasters.</P>
    <P>The disastrous floods, which caused havoc in the southern half of Mozambique in the first half of 2000, continue to cause longer-term difficulties for the country. Rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure is ongoing and the majority of displaced people have returned to their homes. As planting was disrupted by the floods, it is anticipated that agricultural output as a whole will be adversely affected. On a macro level the predictions for economic growth have been downgraded by Ministry of Finance staff and the IMF from over 7% to 3.8%.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland Aid has a particular focus in the southern province of Inhambane, funds from our ongoing development programme are being utilised in the rehabilitation of education and health facilities damaged by flood waters. The main arterial road through the province, the EN1, was badly damaged in a number of places. Rehabilitation of this road is vital for the economic life of the province as it provides the main access throughout the province. This road is being rehabilitated with US $3.3 million of additional Ireland Aid funds. The road has now re-opened to all traffic, although rehabilitation work continues on large sections.</P>
    <P>Although the immediate effects of the floods are almost dealt with, the long-term effects have yet to be calculated. Economic growth has been almost halved and subsistence agricultural output has been badly affected in large parts of the country. More worrying in the shorter term is the onset of the seasonal rains, expected in February. The water table is still alarmingly high from the flooding last spring and it is feared that even normal rains could result in renewed flooding, perhaps as early as next month. The embassy in Maputo is keeping a close watching brief on the emerging situation and reporting regularly on developments.</P>

      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the crisis in the Middle East which has cost the lives of so many Palestinians and Israelis in recent months. We have made clear our position to both sides, at ministerial and official level. We deplore all acts of violence and call again on both sides to exercise the utmost restraint and to do all in their power to avoid further escalation. In particular, we have called on Israel to end the use of military force in dealing with protests where civilian policing methods would be more appropriate, and the economic blockade of Palestinian communities which is causing acute hardship.</P>
      <P>We fully support the efforts both sides have made to reach an agreement and welcome the progress made in the talks in Taba in Egypt. We hope that this progress can be built upon to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region. I have underlined the need for both sides to act courageously to reach agreement in the peace process and to avert the danger that this conflict might escalate further. The main objective must remain the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace, which must necessarily recognise both the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's right to live in peace and security. Such an agreement can end the futile cycle of aggression and counter-aggression, which perpetuates the bloodshed and suffering that has made the achievement of lasting peace and security more difficult.</P>
      <P>The European Union has made clear to both sides the need to do all they can to end the violence and has called on Israel to withdraw its forces from Palestinian territories to the positions they occupied before the current crisis, and to end the use of military force. It has also called on the Palestinian Authority to do all in its power to end the violence. We made clear our willingness to assist in efforts to end the current violence and facilitate a return to the peace process. The General Affairs Council in Brussels last week expressed its full support for the talks in Taba, urging both sides to continue to strive for an end to violence and to continue their negotiations for an agreement in the framework of UN Security Council resolutions. The EU will continue to do all it can to defuse the crisis and to facilitate a lasting peace in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For an agreement to take hold and to endure, it is essential to move to rebuild trust. This will not be easy but it is vital for lasting success. We, with our EU partners, have supported the fact finding commission agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh, on which EU high representative Javier Solana represents the European Union. We see the commission as a significant confidence building <Col N="255" /> measure agreed by both sides. We expect it to meet with the full co-operation of both sides and its work to be open, thorough and transparent. In this regard we are concerned that Israel has suspended co-operation with the commission's technical staff, and would urge them to fully re-engage with the work of the commission.</P>

      <P>The Government shares the widespread concerns about deaths and serious injuries which have resulted from the use of plastic baton rounds &ndash; PBRs &ndash; in Northern Ireland and has consistently urged the need for stricter controls and maximum restraint to curtail the use of these bullets to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomed the recommendation in the report of the Patten Commission that a research programme be conducted to find &ldquo;acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternatives&rdquo; to PBRs. Patten also recommended that the use of PBRs should be subject to the same procedures of deployment, use and reporting as the rest of the UK. Further, their use should be confined to the smallest number of specially trained officers and should be justified in a report to the policing board, copied to the police ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The British Government accepted the recommendation, and the draft implementation plan published in June 2000 stated that the research programme would be launched that month. In the context of a British parliamentary reply in July 2000 it was announced that a steering group to lead the research programme had been established, and the phases of the programme were outlined as follows. The first phase is a literature review, which is due to be completed shortly. The second phase will be an evaluation of the review, and the preparation of a business case, and the third will be to carry out further research. The final phase will be a definition of &ldquo;operational objectives for public order equipment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A revised implementation plan will be published shortly and is expected to indicate the next stages to be taken on the issue. We look forward to a speedy conclusion of the first phase of the research programme and to rapid progress on the next stages.</P>

      <P>The status of the militarily neutral member states of the EU, which include Ireland, is recognised and respected by our EU partners and beyond. The different character of security and defence policies of EU member states is reflected in the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty, which states that &ldquo;The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states .&rdquo;. This provision is unaltered by the draft Treaty of Nice.</P>
      <P>Along with the other militarily neutral EU member states, Sweden, Finland and Austria, we are playing a full part in the development of European security and defence policy. Our constructive involvement in this area is widely recognised. We are also fully engaged in conflict prevention and crisis management issues both at UN level and also in other international fora. The successful outcome to our campaign for election to the UN Security Council is a further recognition by the international community of the particular contribution which we can make.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the priorities set out in the Government's programme, I am determined that Ireland should continue to pursue conflict prevention and crisis management in a manner which fully reflects the traditions and principles which we seek to uphold.</P>

      <P>As the first democratically elected civilian President of Nigeria following 15 years of military rule, President Obasanjo has faced enormous challenges since his inauguration in May 1999, including the consequences of widespread human rights violations. One of his first acts upon becoming President was to set up a human rights violations investigation commission, known as the Oputa Commission, with a remit to investigate human rights abuses between 1966 and 1999. Public hearings have been under way since October 2000 and have brought home to Nigeria for the first time the horrors of military rule. The commission's objective is to promote national reconciliation among Nigerians. The Obasanjo Government has also supported a number of initiatives in the area of penal reform to address human rights violations and to reduce the number of inmates in Nigeria's chronically underfunded and overcrowded prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of Islamic Sharia law in a number of states in northern Nigeria in the course <Col N="258" /> of 2000 has exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions there. While recognising that challenges remain in a number of areas, the Government considers that the human rights situation in Nigeria generally has improved since President Obasanjo's advent to power. We welcome the positive initiatives taken to date, and together with our EU partners and other members of the international community we will continue to encourage the elected authorities to strengthen further the protection of human rights in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Security Council will shortly vote on the renewal until the end of this year of the mandate for the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor &ndash; UNTAET. Ireland has been fully involved in the discussions and preparations leading to the renewal of the mandate. This is, therefore, a timely moment to reflect on the work carried out by UNTAET so far. I commend UNTAET for the progress made to date on the work of reconstruction and capacity building in order to enable the territory to proceed towards independence.</P>
      <P>This task is sizeable and complex, but I am pleased that the UN mission is proceeding with the objective of setting in place suitable structures that can be sustained by the Timorese themselves after independence. A key aspect will be the assumption of responsibility by the Timorese across the full spectrum of administration in all areas. This is already being addressed by a progressive sharing of tasks and responsibilities, within the UNTAET mission and its structures, with the local parties in what is referred to as &ldquo;Timorisation&rdquo;. It is envisaged that this process will continue in order to achieve the declaration of independence, with proper constitutional structures in place at the earliest date.</P>
      <P>While it is not possible to be definite about dates for the conclusion of UNTAET's work, the present plans are to arrange for elections to a constituent assembly in the second half of 2001. The assembly would then draw up a constitution and, when this had been adopted, a government would be formed. In this regard, an important task for UNTAET will be to ensure a secure environment in which the elections can take place and to help with their organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although there have been considerable improvements in the security situation in East Timor, the continuing presence of militias in West Timor still poses a security threat. The large number of East Timorese refugees who remain in West Timor is a further problem which needs to be resolved, not least to allow those who wish to <Col N="259" /> return to East Timor to participate in the elections. The international community, including Ireland, both bilaterally and through the EU and the Security Council, has made known to the Indonesian authorities our concerns at their failure to deal decisively with the militias and the refugee problem in West Timor.</P>
    <P>Ireland is maintaining its contribution to the military component of UNTAET and the next rotation of our contingent is scheduled to take place in mid-February. While the immediate priority now is for UNTAET to continue with its work to enable independence to take place at the earliest date, East Timor's requirement for further assistance, on a reduced basis, after that date is also being examined and initial planning to cater for this has already started.</P>

      <P>On 12 December 2000, Eritrea and Ethiopia signed a comprehensive peace agreement in Algiers bringing an end to their border war. The agreement was the result of intensive negotiations that had taken place under the auspices of the Organisation for African Unity, the United States and the European Union. Under its terms, Ethiopia and Eritrea accept the appointment of an arbitration commission to deal with border demarcation and delimitation and a second commission to deal with compensation issues. Both sides also agree to investigate the causes of the conflict.</P>
      <P>The international community strongly supports the agreement and is very active in monitoring its implementation. The United Nations has authorised the deployment of a 4,200 strong force &ndash; UNMEE &ndash; to monitor the ceasefire and to assist in ensuring the observance of the security commitments agreed by the parties &ndash; Security Council Resolution 1320 of 15 September 2000. It is expected that the full deployment of troops will shortly be completed.</P>
      <P>The Government warmly welcomes these positive developments. In a statement marking the signing of the agreement, I congratulated Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, President Isias Afwerki of Eritrea and other political leaders in both countries for seizing the opportunity to set aside their differences in the interest of developing peace and stability. I also paid tribute to those who mediated the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement offers the real prospect of a lasting peace to the war weary peoples of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is essential that its terms be fully implemented without delay. Lasting peace and stability will enable both governments to devote their full attention to addressing the enormous development needs facing their societies. I urge all political leaders to continue to show the <Col N="260" /> courage necessary to ensure that the opportunities created by the agreement are built upon.</P>
    <P>Ireland recently contributed $75,000 to the OAU liaison mission to the United Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. We will remain fully supportive of the peace process and will continue to assist wherever practicable.</P>

      <P>Since coming to power, President Obasanjo and his Government have made considerable progress in restoring stability, democracy and the recognition of human rights in Nigeria. The President's election in May 1999 was in itself an important step towards the full restoration of democracy in Nigeria after 15 years of military rule. President Obasanjo is personally committed to the promotion of democracy in Africa and has sought to revive the Nigerian economy and restore integrity and sound leadership to the country.</P>
      <P>The Obasanjo Government has inherited an economy in disarray which has resulted in a standard of living lower than it was at the time of independence. High levels of unemployment have exacerbated the poverty in which a large proportion of the population now find themselves. The Nigerian Government has taken a number of important steps to promote stability by addressing the major problems of the economy, including in the areas of market reform, privatisation and the fight against corruption. Higher prices for oil on international markets have generated additional income for the restoration of essential services and infrastructure, and foreign reserves have more than doubled since mid-1998.</P>
      <P>While recognising that challenges remain in a number of areas, the Irish Government considers that the human rights situation in Nigeria has improved since President Obasanjo came to power. One of his first acts upon becoming President was to set up a Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission to investigate human rights abuses perpetrated between 1966 and 1999, with the aim of promoting national reconciliation. The Obasanjo Government has also supported a number of initiatives in the area of penal reform to address human rights violations and to reduce the number of inmates in Nigeria's chronically underfunded and overcrowded prisons.</P>

      <P>The arrest and detention of these two men has given rise to a great deal of international concern, which was compounded by the apparent delay by the Cuban authorities in allowing the diplomatic representatives of the Czech Republic to visit with the men, and in informing the Czech authorities of the accusations and charges against their citizens. I, in common with my EU colleagues, share the concern which has been expressed about the detention of two distinguished citizens of a state which is a candidate for EU accession. Following representations in Dublin and other EU capitals by the Czech authorities, this matter was raised with the Cuban authorities on 17 January by the EU Troika in Havana. It was subsequently decided that the Swedish EU Presidency should write to the Cuban Foreign Minister, Felipe Perez Roque, to express the concern of all EU member states regarding the case. In her letter of 19 January, Foreign Minister Lindh stressed our particular concern that the Cuban authorities should ensure that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations is respected and that the Czech Embassy is accorded its right to maintain contact with its detained citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In January, the World Food Programme presented a world hunger map, which illustrates the extent of global hunger, now estimated as affecting 830 million people around the world. Africa, where Ireland has six priority country programmes, is of particular concern. Many local conflicts have spilled over to <Col N="262" /> span large regions of the continent. In the Greater Horn of Africa alone, 16 million people who suffer from conflict and drought will continue to need assistance. In 2000, Ireland Aid funded over £8.5 million in emergency relief and rehabilitation programmes in Africa. Emergency assistance funding to Africa last year represented almost 70% of the total emergency assistance budget. This follows the pattern of Ireland Aid's committed responses to humanitarian crises in Africa which have included Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola, Sierra Leone and other countries in close co-operation with UN and EU partners.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also actively supported the UN and the EU in their efforts to improve their ability to respond effectively to such humanitarian disasters. During the crisis in the Horn of Africa last year, Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, wrote to Commissioner Nielson expressing our concerns in this regard, and urging the European Commission to intensify its efforts to deliver food aid swiftly. In that context, Ireland has been participating in a major study intended to improve the effectiveness of EC food aid and food security policy. This study recommended a number of changes to EU policy in this area to make it more effective and responsive. These included<i>, inter alia</i>, a refocussing of efforts towards strategic and sectoral issues, the introduction of country strategy papers to assist in streamlining and harmonising rules and procedures and closer co-ordination of efforts with NGOs and recipient governments. The Commission intends to bring forward a communication, based on this study, which it hopes to present to the Development Council later this year with a recommendation to enhance the responsiveness and effectiveness of EC food aid.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of a number of recent conflicts and emergencies in Africa, notably the floods in Mozambique, there is a growing debate on how the international community working through the United Nations can most effectively react. One possible way of responding quickly to such future crises is through the establishment of a UN rapid reaction force, capable of responding immediately to crises. There is considerable focus at the UN on the need for clarification of the principles and the establishment of agreed criteria for intervention by other member states. The requirements of humanitarian intervention must be reconciled with other principles, such as national sovereignty or non-intervention as established by the UN Charter. These are very real and sensitive issues which Secretary General Annan has encouraged the international community to consider urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is actively involved in this debate. The EU is also currently considering the establishment of a rapid reaction facility &ndash; RRF &ndash; which would allow it to respond more effectively to humanitarian crises. Recent conflicts in Africa, the Balkans and the Caucasus have shown that the EU possesses a wide range of humanitarian, economic, financial and civilian resources, but has <Col N="263" /> not always been able to deploy them rapidly or effectively enough. The RRF is intended to be used for rapid interventions in situations of emerging crisis, in crisis or conflict situations and to address the immediate needs in the aftermath of conflicts. Work is currently at an advanced stage within the European Council on finalising a regulation to provide for the establishment of an EU RRF.</P>
    <P>Another important initiative will be the follow-up to the World Food Summit &ndash; WFS &ndash; which took place in Rome in 1996. The WFS adopted a key international target of reducing the number of under-nourished people in the world to half their present level no later than 2015. Ireland will be playing an active part in the follow up to this conference &ndash; World Food Summit + 5 &ndash; which is scheduled to take place in Rome next November. Ireland regards this summit as providing a very important opportunity to review progress towards meeting the WFS target, and to renew global commitment at political level to the task of eliminating hunger and malnutrition and to the achievement of sustainable food security for all people.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which Ireland has endeavoured to mobilise the international community to bring about the abolition of the death penalty; if a specific programme can be compiled to enhance efforts to achieve this objective; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty and accordingly seeks its universal abolition. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in June 1998 common guidelines for European Union initiatives on the issue of the death penalty were agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers. These guidelines form the basis for Ireland's concerted interventions, along with other EU member states, on death penalty issues. The Government is strongly of the view that an EU intervention carries significantly greater force than individual bilateral interventions by national Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to inter<Col N="265" /> ventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where the facts of individual cases suggest a violation of basic minimum standards under international law, the Union will consider making a specific intervention. Since the adoption of the guidelines, the EU has pressed for abolition of the death penalty and has also issued <i>démarches </i>on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also been and will continue to be active in international human rights fora in relation to the death penalty. In particular, we will continue to use our influence at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and other UN fora, as well as within the Council of Europe, to seek abolition of the death penalty. At the forthcoming 57th session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, it is expected that the EU will table a resolution on the question of the death penalty. Ireland will work to ensure maximum support for the resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including in particular the principle of equality of rights for women. We are actively pursuing our human rights priorities in a wide range of international fora, both on a national basis and also in conjunction with our EU partners.</P>
      <P>The International Bill of Human Rights lays down a comprehensive set of rights to which everyone, including women, is entitled. However, additional means for protecting the human rights of women are seen as necessary because of the continuing discrimination encountered by women in every society. The UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women &ndash; CEDAW &ndash; adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979, defines what constitutes discrimination against women and outlines an agenda for national action to end such discrimination. There are currently 166 states parties to CEDAW, including Ireland which ratified the convention in 1985. Countries that have ratified or acceded to the convention are required to put its provisions into practice. They must also submit periodic national reports on measures they have taken to comply with their treaty obligations. I would urge governments to honour fully the commitments entered into under this convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action is taken in a number of international <Col N="266" /> fora to highlight and tackle discrimination against women. The 23rd Special Session of the General Assembly on Women 2000 concluded on 10 June 2000 with the adoption by consensus of a political declaration and an outcome document. The purpose of the special session was to review and appraise the progress of the Beijing Platform for Action agreed at the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 and to identify further initiatives and actions required to accelerate its implementation.</P>
    <P>At the Third Committee of the 55th session of the UN General Assembly a number of issues were considered under the agenda item &ldquo;Advancement of Women&rdquo;, including an important resolution on &ldquo;working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour&rdquo;. With our EU partners we were the lead sponsor of a number of country specific resolutions which highlighted concerns relating to the situation of women in a number of countries, including in Afghanistan where the discrimination against women is to be strongly condemned.</P>
    <P>At the forthcoming 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the human rights of women will also be an important agenda item. Ireland will remain actively engaged in seeking to ensure that the human rights of women are protected and promoted in every society.</P>

      <P>The Nice Treaty does not alter in any substantial way the provisions of the Amsterdam treaty in relation to European security and defence. Enhanced co-operation or flexibility has been agreed as a procedure which could apply in the common foreign and security policy, subject to unanimity in the decision establishing the group and involvement by a minimum of eight countries. However, the relevant article of the treaty, Article J, states quite clearly that closer co-operation does not apply to matters having security and defence implications.</P>
      <P>Participation in Petersberg missions will continue to be for governments to decide on a voluntary and sovereign basis according to their respective national arrangements. In Ireland's case, that means a UN mandate and approval by Dáil Éireann.</P>

While experimental work on the development of monthly and seasonal forecasts is being carried out at institutes such as the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast, of which Ireland is a member, Met Éireann does not regard such forecasts as sufficiently reliable to be of value to the public.</P>
      <P>Met Éireann has consulted with the British Met Office and has ascertained that no forecast corresponding to that indicated in the question was issued by that office. The term &ldquo;North Atlantic oscillation&rdquo; refers to variations in the pattern of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic and adjacent areas which occur over periods of weeks and months. These variations influence Irish weather. However, the future behaviour of the North Atlantic oscillation cannot be predicted with any degree of reliability.</P>
      <P>From the evidence available to it at present, Met Éireann has no basis for predicting that the probability of storms and flooding up to the end of March 2001 is any higher than normal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 289, 312, 313 and 314 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no statutory function in relation to operational matters which are a day-to-day function of the board of Iarnród Éireann. However, Iarnród <Col N="269" /> Éireann informs me that it introduced a new DART service to Malahide in mid-December last, following the placing into service of ten additional DART carriages. As a consequence, a revised timetable for all services on the northern suburban lines was introduced. Following the introduction of the new timetable, I received numerous complaints from Iarnród Éireann customers.</P>
    <P>I raised these concerns with Iarnród Éireann and was informed by the company that there are capacity constraints in relation to the frequency of trains which can safely use the rail track network on the northern suburban rail line into the city centre. The maximum safety limit on this line is 12 trains per track per hour.</P>
    <P>To accommodate the DART service to Malahide, Iarnród Éireann informs me they had to reschedule their services to and from Drogheda and Howth. To offset the impact of the changes in schedule, some DART trains have been increased from four to six carriages, thus providing extra capacity. This position will improve further at the end of April when a further 16 new DART carriages are commissioned. In the meantime, additional drivers will have been recruited and trained which will enhance reliability. In all, there will be an increase of almost 30% DART capacity, compared with November last.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has advised me that it has experienced a 15% to 20% increase in passenger carryings since the new timetable was introduced but acknowledges that there has been some inconvenience to some customers. In response, it has met local public representatives, local groups and customers to look at ways of addressing the concerns raised. I understand it is now planning some further adjustments to timetables for these customers in response to these concerns and these should be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann also acknowledges the need for better communications with their customers at the time of changes in service and in the event of disruption and are committed to a renewed customer focus as developments take place in these services in the period ahead. There will be enhanced capacity provided for customers on the northern line over the coming months. To cater for general growth in demand for these services over the coming years, the national development plan provides for a further 12 new DART carriages to be delivered to Iarnród Éireann in the last quarter of this year which, when operational in late Spring 2002, will result in an increase in the capacity of DART services by over 40% in the period since November last. In addition, Iarnród Éireann has an option on a further 36 new DART carriages. It has also ordered 60 new diesel Arrow carriages which are due for delivery in 2002 and 2003, to be financed under the national development plan. These new carriages will be used to provide increased capacity on northern suburban rail services by allowing a lengthening of suburban trains. Iarnród Éireann has separately contracted for a further 20 Arrow <Col N="270" /> carriages. All northern suburban rail platforms, apart from the DART stations, can accommodate eight carriage trains. Plans are in hand to extend all DART platforms to accommodate eight carriage trains. Plans are also at an advanced stage in Iarnród Éireann for a major investment project to increase the frequency of trains on the northern suburban rail network by providing enhanced signalling, all eight car trains, improved power supply on the overhead power lines and the upgrading of the current two track system to three tracks. I have asked Iarnród Éireann to accelerate the submission to me of all its proposals for the upgrade of services on the northern suburban line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparatory work on the Luas line from Tallaght to the city centre commenced in September 1999 and is now well advanced. This work, which includes utility diversion work and necessary roadworks, will be completed shortly on the section from Tallaght to Red Cow. Work has recently begun on the diversion of the main Cork-Dublin gas pipeline from Suir Road bridge to facilitate the line on Davitt Road. Work on the diversion of water mains and telecom cables in Steevens' Lane, near Heuston Station, is also under way.</P>
      <P>The construction of the depot for the line at Red Cow began in October 2000 and is on schedule for completion in July 2001. Negotiations with the two shortlisted bidders for the main construction contract, involving the track laying and the installation of mechanical and electrical systems, are at an advanced stage. This contract will be awarded next month and the track laying will commence shortly afterwards. Construction on this line is due to be completed in January 2003, in accordance with the timetable set down by the Government in May 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trams which will run on the Tallaght-city centre line have been ordered from the French company, Alstom. The first of these trams will come off the production line in the coming months and, after testing, will arrive in Dublin in October 2001. The remaining trams are scheduled for delivery at a rate of six per quarter, from January 2002. The competition to select the operator for the service commenced, on schedule, in December 2000. The competition has been designed with a view to selecting the operator in October 2001, to coincide with the delivery of the first tram and to give the operator sufficient time <Col N="271" /> to commission the system. I expect passenger services to commence during 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives which seek to <Col N="272" /> address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas. Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, IR£21 million was made available to support the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan 2000-06, to IR£147 million. This funding will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services in the regions.</P>
      <P>The first call for proposals under the National Development Plan 2000-06 closed on 22 September 2000. The Department received 28 applications for funding under this call. These were assessed and evaluated at arm's length by independent consultants. I recently announced the successful 13 projects that will receive a total of IR£59 million in national development plan aid. Three of the successful projects involve the development of infrastructure in County Meath &ndash; project reference numbers DPE2000-04; DPE2000-07 and DPE2000-26. Details of all the successful projects follow. My Department is now reviewing future infrastructure investment needs in the light of the results of this first call for proposals.</P>

      <P>As part of the analysis process for light rail in Dublin, a comprehensive study was carried out by the light rail project office in CIE before the decision on the gauge for Luas was finalised. It was considered that, for on-street running of light rail vehicles, the benefits of adopting the standard European gauge &ndash; 48½ &ndash; considerably outweighed those of the Irish gauge &ndash; 53.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, the narrower European gauge affords certain technical benefits and flexibility where trams run on-street. In addition, the cost of procuring rolling stock for the standard European gauge is considerably less than that which would be required to custom design and build trams for the Irish gauge. The issue of the appropriate gauge to be used was dealt with in some detail at the public inquiry for Line A &ndash; Tallaght-Abbey Street. In his report, the inspector to the inquiry, Judge Seán O'Leary, concluded that the decision to use the standard European gauge was the correct decision and I accepted the inspector's view.</P>

      <P>I have outlined in response to previous questions the existing capital development programmes at the three State airports, which are due for completion in the next couple of years. As to plans for the medium and longer term development of the airports, including in the case of Dublin the proposed parallel runway, my Department and Aer Rianta liaise closely and maintain regular contact on the evolution of these plans. Aer Rianta has stated its intention of consulting widely with all their major stakeholders over the next few months, before finalising its future capital development programmes for my consideration. </P>
      <P>As to the strategy in relation to Aer Rianta's corporate future, my Department will continue to give careful consideration to the options in this regard taking account of developments in the airport sector in Europe and further afield. Also relevant in this regard will be clarity in relation to the framework for independent economic regulation of the airports which will emerge following the enactment of the Aviation Regulation Bill which is currently before this House. The issues involved are complex and my concern in relation to whatever strategy is ultimately decided upon for the corporate future of Aer Rianta is that it is the correct strategy for the users of the Irish airports, the company itself and for its employees. </P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the EU Commission previously rejected proposals for a PSO route linking Waterford and Dublin on the grounds that the distance involved is relatively short and that the route was adequately served by other transport modes.</P>
      <P>I will of course have any new application from Waterford Airport for such a PSO carefully examined and assessed by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to this matter has not changed since my response to recent questions. For the information of the Deputy, the position is as follows. The accident was the subject of a public inquiry held in the Four Courts in June 1953 before the late Judge Thomas Teevan S.C. The inquiry found that the Aer Lingus DC 3 aircraft on a scheduled flight from Dublin to Birmingham on 1 January, crashed at Spernal near Birmingham with the loss of the aircraft. There were no fatalities.</P>
      <P>The inquiry found that the captain was responsible for the accident by allowing both engines cut out by feeding from the same fuel tank which ran dry. The captain's licence was endorsed by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the effect of which prohibited him from flying passenger aircraft. The licence was restored without prejudice in 1977. The late captain's family now seek the quashing of the verdict of the court and officials of my Department are in contact with them. I believe that these discussions should shortly result in an agreed mechanism for a structured review of the issues which are of concern to the family.</P>

      <P>My Department is supporting e-government at a number of levels. In relation to the availability of competitive services I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas. In 2001, for example, £20.3 million has been provided in order to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services in the regions.</P>
      <P>In 2001, my Department will also benefit from a major upgrade in facilities and training, which was undertaken last year at a cost of £1.2 million. A further £250,000 approximately will be spent in 2001 in upgrading web based materials and activities. My Department is also finalising a proposed three year programme to deliver an increasing range of our services electronically.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> As I have indicated previously, enhancements to the pension entitlements of pensioners must be linked to and in line with any improvements that may emerge from negotiations between staff interests and the companies concerned regarding new pension schemes. The terms of any new schemes are essentially a matter for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to negotiate with staff interests within the terms of overall Government policy on public sector pensions. My Department will monitor these negotiations with particular regard to the concerns of retired staff in the context of the new schemes.</P>

      <P>In compliance with EC (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Amendment) Regulations, 1999, and the technical guidelines for the construction of gas pipelines operated by my Department, all prospective applicants are required to carry out either an environmental impact statement or environmental appraisal report depending on the size of pipeline in support of their applications. A detailed engineering report is also required in respect of proposed large transmission pipelines.</P>
      <P>These reports provide details of route selections, pipeline design and protection systems, together with details of how the pipeline will be constructed and how different terrains and environments will be dealt with.

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the spouses of former employees of Dublin Gas who had retired before BGE acquired the assets of the company in 1987. I can confirm that BGE did approach my Department concerning the possibility of an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment to these spouses and I can assure the Deputy that the matter was considered at length both by my Department and the Department of Finance. The request for a spouse's pension on a non-contributory basis for these workers was refused on the basis that on taking over the old Dublin Gas Company, BGE accepted liability to continue the payment of pensions in accordance with the terms of the pension scheme under which the pensioners retired. No commitment existed that these arrangements would be subject to review for enhancement. </P>
      <P>Any concession regarding payment of a spouse's pension on a non-contributoy basis would lead to knock-on effects in both private and public sector schemes. </P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 307 and 310 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 2000, Bord Gáis Éireann &ndash; BGE &ndash; has statutory responsibility to develop and maintain an efficient and cost effective gas transmission and distribution system. Extensions to the system are a matter for <Col N="284" /> BGE to decide on the basis of commercial criteria. Applications to construct transmission pipelines require my consent whereas extensions of the distribution network fall exclusively with the day to day responsibilities of the board by authority of section 2 (6) of the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>Provisions of EU Directive 98/30/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas require member states to liberalise their natural gas markets. My policy objectives regarding gas infrastructure reflect the need to ensure that there are appropriate economic signals in the natural gas market to promote the establishment of efficient new pipeline infrastructure. It is my understanding that BGE is currently reviewing, as part of a national study, regions that may be supplied with gas on an economic basis, including the needs of the north-west region. When this study is completed, BGE will have a fuller picture as to the viability of extending the gas transmission and distribution networks into areas previously unserviced, and will develop plans for extension to those areas where it is economically viable to do so.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the companies which now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-99, IR£21 million was made available to support the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-06, to IR£147 million. This funding will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services in the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first call for proposals under the National Development Plan 2000-06 closed on 22 September 2000. The Department received 28 applications for funding under this call and I recently <Col N="287" /> announced the successful 13 projects that will receive a total of IR£59 million in NDP aid. Unfortunately, no applications were received for Connemara, Clifden or Carna. My Department is now reviewing future infrastructure investment needs in the light of the results of this first call for proposals and I expect to announce further initiatives to address gaps in communications infrastructure in rural areas later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much speculation in the media in recent weeks concerning the use of munitions containing depleted uranium &ndash; DU &ndash; in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1994-95) and in Kosovo (1999). Irish personnel were deployed with SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 1997, two years after the cessation of hostilities, and with KFOR in Kosovo in August 1999, two months after the end of NATO's bombing campaign. The operations assigned to these units did not require Defence Forces personnel to go into any vehicles struck by DU rounds or to handle any war debris. The transport company with KFOR is deployed in an area well removed from the area where most of the DU ammunition was used. Ongoing surveys carried out since the beginning of both missions, throughout the areas of operations, have shown only normal background levels of radiation. In addition, the Defence Forces took specific measures to confirm the safety of Irish troops in Kosovo. Last year a Defence Forces Ordnance Corps officer measured the levels of radiation in the area of deployment of the Irish transport company. The measurements, including those taken from the mud flaps of vehicles following various transportation tasks to diverse locations in Kosovo, indicated similar background levels of radiation as obtain in Ireland. These measurements were confirmed by measurements taken by other nationalities who operate in the same area as Irish troops.</P>
      <P>In the light of current concerns, the Defence Forces sent an investigative team, comprising an Ordnance Corps officer and a medical officer, to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo earlier this month. The team again took readings of radiation levels and consulted extensively with medical and technical experts from other KFOR troop contributing countries. Their findings confirm earlier assessments of normal levels of background radiation. Continuous testing of food and water has shown them to be safe. Radiation levels in camps occupied by Irish troops were again tested and found to be safe. The medical officers who have visited Irish troops have not encountered any instances of unusual ill health. On the basis of all the evidence available to them, the Defence Forces military authorities have assessed the threat to the health of Irish troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo as negligible. The Defence Forces will continue to monitor the situation in the Balkans.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Defence sets out a comprehensive strategy for a reshaping and re-equipping of the Defence Forces to ensure that they are geared for the opportunities and challenges of the changing security and defence environment. This strategy embraces organisation, equipment, training and technology aspects. The White Paper also recognised that the primary focus of the Defence Forces, when not engaged on operations, is training and preparation. The appropriate training for all Defence Forces formations and units is based on conventional military doctrine to prepare them to fulfil the roles laid down by Government, including overseas peace support operations. As a reflection of the defence and security environment, including developments in relation to the EU Rapid Reaction Force, increased emphasis will be placed on exercises stressing interoperability, procedures and doctrine.</P>
      <P>Weapon systems, doctrine and tactics are constantly evolving to meet modern requirements. Operational readiness will be maintained through realistic individual and collective training. The Defence Forces must train and maintain appropriate levels of readiness with all personnel equipped and prepared accordingly. The training of personnel in the technical and tactical skills of the military profession plays a vital role in Defence Forces activities.</P>
      <P>Future equipment requirements are already the subject of examination within my Department by the high level civil-military planning and procurement group established under the White Paper. A comprehensive programme to modernise equipment is in place to ensure that the Defence Forces are in a position to contribute to modern peace support operations.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces training centre, located at the Curragh, which includes the UN training school, has the critical role in providing the facilities to prepare the Defence Forces for the conduct of military activities and maintaining required training standards within all formations and units. At present, there are no proposals to lease or purchase additional properties in relation to training for the EU Rapid Reaction Force.</P>

      <P>In total, 47 apprentices have been enlisted in the Permanent Defence Forces over the past three years. Seventeen Naval Service and 15 Air Corps apprentices were enlisted in 1999. A competition for Air Corps apprentices was advertised in August 2000, from which a total of 15 apprentices were enlisted in January this year. The military authorities advise that they are currently in the preparatory stages of organising a further competition for Air Corps apprentices which they hope to advertise in late spring or early summer 2001. I am satisfied with the level of apprentices enlisted over the period 1999 to date.</P>
      <P>The decision to close the Army Apprentice School at Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, has had no adverse effect on the number of apprenticeships being offered.</P>

      <P>The position is that upwards of £43 million is being allocated in my Department's Estimates this year for the provision of new buildings and the upgrading of existing facilities. In this connection, the provision of working, cooking and sleeping facilities for the Defence Forces had a high priority. Current projects in this years programme are as follows: new dining complex/NCO's mess Curragh Camp, upgrade of Connolly Officers' mess Curragh Camp for student accommodation, upgrade of blocks at Clarke Barracks Curragh Camp for other ranks' accommodation, upgrade of blocks at Cathal Brugha Barracks for officer accommodation and upgrade of kitchens at St. Bricin's Hospital. Other projects which are now at the planning stage include the upgrade of block at McKee Barracks for other ranks accommodation, upgrade of accommodation at Coolmoney Camp, County Wicklow, and Kilworth Camp, County Cork, upgrade of officers' mess kitchen at Ceannt Barracks, Curragh Camp, and new cookhouses at Renmore Barracks, Galway, and Stephens Barracks, Limerick.</P>

      <P>My Department is completing its e-government strategy and has allocated significant resources to maximise public service delivery and improve customer service through the use of modern ICTs (information and communication technologies). The Department of Defence is actively involved in the central Government initiatives in relation to e-procurement and e-recruitment and is pursuing e-business opportunities within the Department and with external agencies and suppliers of goods and services. The Department will continue to promote awareness of the information society through ongoing consultation with branch managers and users of its services. A number of information seminars on the subject have been conducted for staff of the Department. It is proposed to commit approximately £140,000 in 2001 on e-government projects.</P>

      <P>Over 300 Defence Forces personnel, including the current contingent of 104 personnel, have served with the Irish transport company in Kosovo as part of KFOR. As a result of recent media speculation regarding the use of depleted uranium &ndash; DU &ndash; weapons in the Balkans, the Defence Forces sent an investigative team, comprising an Ordnance Corps officer and a medical officer, to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo earlier this month. Their findings confirm earlier assessments of normal levels of background radiation. Continuous testing of food and water has shown them to be safe and radiation levels in camps occupied by Irish troops were tested and found to be safe. On the basis of this and other evidence available to them, the Defence Forces military authorities have assessed the threat to the health of Irish troops in the Balkans as negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the above, the Defence Forces are putting in place a medical screening programme for all Irish troops who have served or are serving in the Balkans region as well as personnel who served as military observers in Kuwait following the Gulf War. This medical screening programme is being put in place to pro<Col N="297" /> vide reassurance for personnel and their families and will include blood and urine tests along with a clinical examination. As the administrative procedures are already in place, it is expected that the screening programme will begin in the very near future. </P>

      <P>These questions refer to the issue of having military service allowance included in the calculation of pensions of Defence Forces personnel who retired before 1 August 1990. As I have previously indicated to the House, this issue will be further considered in the light of the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was recently submitted to my colleague the Minister for Finance. The Government intends to publish the report and once it has had an opportunity to consider it in detail to make formal decisions on the commission's recommendations, including any related to the pensionability of allowances in so far as it affects public service groups and pensioners.</P>

      <Quest>the action he will take in view of the finding by the Food Safety Authority that one in five of abattoirs which are under the control of local authorities failed a Food Safety Authority check to ensure BSE risk material had been removed fully from meat carcasses.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for supervision of day to day operations at domestic abattoirs rests with the appropriate local authority working under service contract to the FSAI. Consequently, it is primarily a matter for each local authority concerned and for FSAI to address deficiencies identified by the FSAI in respect of the abattoirs within its functional area, in order to meet its contractual obligations to the authority. It is also worth emphasising that primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of any food product, including beef, lies unambiguously with the individual who puts it on the market. In this specific instance, the FSAI took appropriate action in respect of the breaches detected at individual abattoir level during the SRM audit and subsequently directed the local authority controlled abattoirs not to engage in the slaughter of animals over 30 months of age.</P>
      <P>On a broader level, my Department is committed to ensuring that the highest standards of control are maintained in all areas of the beef industry. As far as domestic abattoirs are concerned, my Department has since 1997 provided financial assistance to local authorities to enable them to make good certain shortcomings which had been identified in 1996 in the discharge by them of their statutory responsibilities for meat inspection and certification at domestic abattoirs. The provision by my Department of such financial assistance has continued into the era of the service contract arrangements between individual local authorities and FSAI. In the context of these arrangements between each local authority and the FSAI, I sought and secured from Government a significant increase (from £1.5 million to £3.8 million) in the level of Exchequer assistance paid to the local authorities in this regard. Payment of funding by my Department in each individual case is contingent on the FSAI being satisfied that the local authority concerned has discharged its contractual obligations.</P>
      <P>Along with other Departments, my Department will shortly participate in a review, which will consider the most appropriate location in the longer term of responsibility for legislation currently assigned to local authorities which requires the services of a professional veterinarian. My Department has already been in contact with the relevant Departments with a view to commencing this review.</P>

      <P>The original REPS application, received in my Department on 24 June 1999, stated that the person named owned and farmed 40.82 hectares. It subsequently emerged that at the time of application he did not have title to the lands in one of the folios which were the subject of the application. This land was therefore ineligible for payment at that time.</P>
      <P>My Department is now satisfied that the above lands have now been fully registered in the applicants name. It is also satisfied that the lands have been managed in accordance with the REP scheme agri-environmental specifications. In all of the circumstances, my Department is prepared to make payment on the eligible area contained in the folio in question from the first anniversary of commencement in the scheme. This land will continue to be eligible for REPS payments for the remainder of the REPS contract. The participant has been informed of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 348, 354, 361 and 442 together.</P>
      <P>The current position is that responsibility for exotic animals is shared by a number of Departments. The Office of Public Works has general responsibility specifically for Dublin Zoo. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species is under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is the competent authority in relation to Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999 relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos. One of the measures to be taken by member states of the EU under the directive is to prevent the escape of animals in order to avoid possible ecological threats to indigenous species and to prevent the intrusion of outside pets and vermin. Veterinary certification on import is the only area where my Department has a responsibility in relation to exotic animals. Provided there is compliance with veterinary rules, there can be no restriction in inter-Community trade in exotic animals and consequently these animals may legitimately be kept in member states of the European Union.</P>
      <P>In view of the dispersed nature of responsibilities in this area, my Department took the initiative some time ago to set up an interdepartmental group to examine issues relating to dangerous and exotic animals in this country. While the group has held a number of meetings it has yet to recommend how best to deal with the problems created by such animals. It will, no doubt, in due course address the question of legislation and the appropriate authority to implement it. I am aware of the draft legislation furnished to the Department by the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and believe that it will be of interest to the group in its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the foregoing it is clear the present demarcation situation is complicated and that there is not yet a basis for asserting or proposing that any one of the agencies concerned should be solely or primarily responsible for this matter. Nonetheless, I do appreciate that a variety of concerns arise in this area and have asked the inter<Col N="306" /> departmental committee to expedite its work on this issue.</P>
    <P>As regards the protection of animals, the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, are the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals in Ireland. The legislation is enforced by the Garda, who may, on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal in this country. This Department is acutely aware of the need to prevent cruelty to animals and for this reason it took the opportunity offered by the Control of Horses Act, 1996, to increase significantly the penalties for cruelty under the 1911 Act.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted a 1999 area aid application on which they declared a total of 31.84 hectares of forage area and 5.30 hectares of arable land. However, a part of one of the parcels claimed on this application was also claimed by another applicant. This matter was resolved in favour of the other applicant on the basis of maps supplied to my Department. An over claim was therefore established in respect of the area claimed by the persons named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulations 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the <Col N="308" /> difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
    <P>Therefore in this case the penalty is based on a difference of between 3% and 20%. A penalty of 2.94 hectares has to be applied leaving the area determined for payment at 28.90 hectares of forage and 5.30 hectares of arable.</P>
    <P>Extensification premium is payable on all animals paid under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes if the stocking density on the holding is less than 1.40 livestock units per hectare. The stocking density for the persons named based on a forage area of 28.90 hectares is 1.48 lus/ha. As the stocking density on the holding is not less than 1.40 lus/ha the persons named have no entitlement to 1999 extensification premium.

      <P>Since 1992 there have been ten cases of BSE in ten herds in County Louth and in each case the BSE affected animal was buried on the farm, as per procedures at that <Col N="309" /> time. The number of animals depopulated in these herds was 1,553 with the total compensation issued amounting to £1,171,414.</P>
      <P>As I have already previously indicated, I do not consider it appropriate to publish the precise locations of burial sites in each county, which would entail the publication of the name and address of every farmer in whose herd a BSE suspect animal was found. As such material will identify the name and address of every farmer in the county in whose herd a BSE suspect animal was found, its public release could have various repercussions, both for the persons in question and in a wider context. From a BSE control perspective, it could discourage farmers from reporting BSE suspect animals, thereby undermining the national effort to safeguard public and animal health and contain and eliminate the disease from the national herd. I am, however, prepared to make available on a confidential basis, and at the request of each county manager, the locations of burials in the relevant count, for the purpose of facilitating local authorities in allaying local concerns which in this context might be addressed to them. The information is being released on an ongoing basis to those county managers who have requested it.</P>

      <P>Payment of the first advance of the 2000 ewe premium and rural world premium was made to the person named on 23 June 2000.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for payment under the rural world premium applicants must have at least 50% of their holding used for sheep production in the disadvantaged area and must also submit a valid area aid application. The person named stated on his 2000 ewe premium application that at least 50% of his holding was in the disadvantaged area. On that basis payment of £481.97 including £254.18 rural world premium was made by way of the first advance. However, subsequent checks revealed that the person named did not submit a 2000 area aid application. Consequently this gave rise to an overpayment in respect of the rural world premium which was offset against the second advance of £225.78 due under the scheme. The outstanding balance of £28.40 will be recovered from the final instalment when payments commence next month.</P>
      <P>Under the 2000 sheep headage scheme the person named applied on 116 mountain ewes and 24 hoggets but as he did not submit a 2000 area aid application he is not eligible for any payment under the scheme.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the scheme of early retirement from farming that participants must apply to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, on reaching their 66th birthday, for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Participants in the scheme are told of this condition when they join and are required to notify my Department if they are awarded an old age pension.</P>
      <P>The person named reached 66 years of age on 7 May 2000 and became entitled to a contributory old age pension from that date, but he did not inform my Department. My Department became aware of the position in September 2000. As his old age pension was greater than his early retirement pension, payment of the early retirement pension ceased automatically. An overpayment had also arisen in respect of previous months. My Department, to comply with its obligations in respect of EU funds, has no option but to recover this overpayment in full. The person named has been informed of the position and my officials are available to discuss with him the terms on which he will make repayment of the amount he owes.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an application under the 2000 suckler cow premium-cattle headage schemes on 2 May 2000. He applied for premium on 13 animals under the suckler cow premium scheme and 24 animals under the cattle headage scheme. An inspection was carried out on his herd on 27 June 2000 and at inspection two of the cows presented had lost their tags. The person named was informed on 12 July 2000 that as a result of the cows having lost their tags the animals would be deleted from the cattle headage and suckler cow premium claims and, in line with the terms and conditions of the schemes, payments on the remaining animals under the 2000 cattle headage scheme would be reduced by 18.18% and payments under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme would be reduced by 15.38%.</P>
      <P>The person named appealed the decision on 27 July 2000 to the local office of my Department. He was informed of the result of the appeal on 31 July 2000.

      <P>Where it is determined that a participant in REPS has incurred a penalty as a result of a deficient agri-environmental plan or a planner error, my Department may impose appropriate sanctions on the planner but the penalty on the participant cannot be waived. However, the participant has a right of appeal to the national REPS appeals committee. It is open to the appeals committee to decide to reduce or waive penalties and it is open to the committee to take planner errors into account in its deliberations.</P>

The programme was also presented to the special North/South EU Programmes Body for its endorsement &ndash; as regards cross-Border aspects &ndash; in tandem with the Northern Ireland Leader programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advertisements inviting interested groups to submit business plans for the Leader+ programme and the national rural development programme were placed with a closing date for receipt of applications of 27 October 2000. Eight-nine applications were received, comprising 42 <Col N="318" /> applications in respect of the Leader+ programme and 47 applications under the national rural development programme. The process for the selection of groups to operate these programmes has commenced.</P>
    <P>The selection process which will determine the appointment of rural development groups to operate the two new programmes is proceeding contemporaneously with the Commission's consideration of the Leader+ operational programme. The Commission has five months from the receipt of the programme for examination before deciding on approval. Given its complementarity with Leader+, the EU Commission has indicated that the approval process for the national rural development programme should take place simultaneously. Following the Commission's approval, the appointment of groups to deliver the programmes will be decided by Government.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are currently in progress between my Department and the European Commission on Ireland's Leader+ Operational Programme with a view to obtaining approval at the earliest time to clear the way for commencement of Leader activity in rural areas for the period to 2006. Meanwhile, my Department has made interim funding available to existing Leader groups on a without prejudice basis to help maintain the capacity, resource, experience and work of rural development groups pending the coming on stream of the new Leader programmes.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of having received an application from the person named for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the year 2001 national reserve. He did apply for an allocation from the 2000 national reserve under category D. This category was reserved for farmers who did not qualify under any of the priority categories A, B or C. Quota could only be allocated to category D applicants if any quota remained in the reserve after allocations were made to eligible applicants under the priority categories. Because of the demand for reserve quota, there was only sufficient quota available to allow allocations to be made to category D applicants who had less than eight livestock units.</P>
      <P>As the person named had 52 livestock units, there was no quota remaining that could be allocated to him. In all, 5,744 farmers applied under category D but only 881 of these received a reserve quota allocation. Of the 4,863 farmers who did not receive an allocation, 3,978 had less that 52 livestock units. There was insufficient quota in the 2001 reserve to allow any allocations to be made to any of the applicants under category D.</P>
      <P>The next allocation of reserve quota will be made from the 2002 national reserve in November next. The criteria and priority categories will be proposed by the quota review group in July next and submitted to me for approval and I cannot say at this stage what priority categories they will propose.</P>

    <P>The likely explanation for the higher numbers of cases in dairy herds is that such animals are generally more intensively reared and were therefore, more likely to have been exposed to contaminated feed in the years prior to 1996, in which cross contamination in feed mills was possible. Controls were strengthened in October 1996 to prohibit feed mills producing ruminant feed from producing feed for any other species, using meat and bone meal, in order to prevent cross contamination of feed.

      <P>Approximately 12,000 tonnes of Biofert are produced annually at Dublin Corporation's sewage treatment plant at Ringsend. This is spread on approximately 50 farms in the Leinster region and a nutrient management plan is prepared for each farm involved.</P>
      <P>For Biofert to be suitable for land application it must comply with the requirements of the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations, 1998 and the Code of Good Practice for the Use of Biosolids in Agriculture (Department of the Environment and Local Government, 1999).</P>
      <P>The process of producing Biofert involves thermal treatment of sewage sludge. The standard used to assess the level of pathogens in Biofert is that set by the USA's Environmental Protection Agency for class A sludge. The pathogen level in Biofert (which is treated at 450-500 degrees centigrade) is only 1% of the maximum level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

    <P>Irreversible contamination of lands will only result from excessive application of heavy metals over time and is the most likely cause of the problem in the countries referred to.

      <P>The person named made an application for one animal under the 1999 special beef premium on 16 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Under EU regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application. The person named declared 13.60 forage hectares on his area aid application and therefore is entitled to payment on a maximum of 27.20 reckonable livestock units.</P>
      <P>Reckonable livestock units consist of animals submitted by the applicant for special beef premium, suckler cow premium and ewe premium schemes together with notional livestock units derived from any milk quota held.</P>
      <P>The person named had a milk quota of 26,766 gallons which equates to 29.83 livestock units (26,766 divided by the national average milk yield of 897 gallons ) and exceeds his full livestock unit entitlement of 27.20. Therefore no payment is due to the person named in respect of his 1999 special beef premium application. The person named did not submit a 2000 special beef premium application.</P>

      <Quest>the level of compensation available from his Department for various categories of animals arising from a BSE outbreak in a cattle herd; the time frame for the negotiations on the compensation package in an individual case; and the time frame for the removal of animals from an infected herd.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions governing compensation payable to herdowners is established in legislation. The valuation methodology seeks to ensure that the value determined is in conformity with the statutory provision and that there is consistency in the determination of valuations. In addition, a herdowner has access to an appeals procedure in the event that he does not agree with the initial valuation in respect of depopulated animals.</P>
      <P>The compensation applied to depopulated herds as a result of BSE is set out in the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 1990 (S.I. No. 195 of 1990), Article 4 of which provides that the compensation payable shall be an amount equal to the market value of the animal. This is further clarified in Article 4(3) where &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is defined as the price which might reasonably have been obtained for the animal at the time of its slaughter from a purchaser in the open market.</P>
      <P>The compensation applied to the suspect animal is laid down in Article 2(1) of the Diseases Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ) (Amendment) Order, 1990 (S.I. No. 98 of 1990). This provides for compensation as follows: (a) where the animal was an affected animal, either (i) the market value of the animal, or (ii)the average price in respect of the month which occurred two months prior to the month in which the animals was slaughtered, whichever is the less, and (b) where examination of samples taken from the animal slaughtered does not confirm that it was an affected animal, the market value of the animal.</P>
      <P>Valuation of the suspect animal takes place when it is decided to treat that animal as a BSE suspect by a Department veterinary inspector. A Department valuer normally makes contact with the herdowner shortly after positive confirmation of BSE with a view to valuation of the herd being carried out within two weeks of the date of positive confirmation of BSE. Following that initial meeting there is no fixed time frame laid down in legislation for the valuation to be agreed. The herdowner may need time to consider the initial valuation or, alternatively, may wish to avail of the appeals procedure laid down in the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) Amendment) (No 2) Order, 1990 (S.I. No. 195 of 1990). The latter provides for recourse to an independent valuer and ultimately to an arbitrator, should the herdowner wish to pursue this course of action. There is currently a backlog of BSE herds awaiting valuation, but my Department is endeavouring to clear this within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The herd will normally be slaughtered within one week of the conclusion of the valuation process although this can vary having regard to the size of the herd and the capacity in the sole approved slaughtering plant for BSE in the country.</P>

      <P>The persons named submitted an application under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme for 15 cows on 18 May 2000.</P>
      <P>The animal bearing tag number PGA 141364, which had been included on the application, was slaughtered on 2 August 2000 within the six month retention period. The persons named were written to on 23 October 2000 and queried about the slaughter of the animal. They replied that the animal was slaughtered as it had suffered from mastitis. They had replaced the animal with a heifer on 16 October 2000.</P>
      <P>Term and condition 22(a) of the terms and conditions of the scheme states that replacement must take place within 20 days of the date of loss/sale and that the district livestock office must be notified of replacement details, in writing, within ten working days of the date of replacement.</P>
      <P>As the persons named did not notify the replacement details within the required period they were written to on 3 November 2000 and informed that the animal in question was being deleted from the claim with consequent reduction penalties on payments due on the remaining animals. The persons named have appealed the decision and have supported their appeal with certification from their veterinary surgeon that the animal was slaughtered on his advice. The appeal has been accepted and the animal is being deleted from the claim without any reduction penalties being imposed on the remaining animals in line with the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>However, ongoing system checks have revealed that another animal bearing tag number PTA 283374 has been slaughtered within the retention period on 25 October 2000. The persons named were written to on 24 January 2000 and asked to explain the slaughter of the animal. When a reply is received by my Department the claim of the persons named will be processed and any entitlement established will be paid.</P>

      <P>Grants under the 2000 sheep headage scheme are based, <i>inter alia</i>, on the forage area and classification of grazings available in the disadvantaged area as indicated on an applicant's 2000 area aid form. In this case <Col N="329" /> the person named applied on 80 mountain ewes and according to area aid records the forage area available is classified as lowland grazings only. Following an inspection of his flock the person named was notified in writing that he was ineligible for any payment under the scheme. He was also advised that he could have his case reviewed by submitting a written appeal to the district livestock inspector at his local office. No record of an appeal has been received by my Department. However, if he wishes to have his case reviewed he should contact his local office.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium in respect of 47 animals on 1 March 2000. His application was the subject of an on-farm inspection. During the course of that inspection it was discovered that one animal was not in the applicant's ownership and possession on the date of application. This animal was rejected with penalty. In addition, a number of animals on the applicant's holding were found to be non-compliant with regard to the identification and registration regulations resulting in a reduction penalty on the applicant's three applications lodged in the 12 months prior to the inspection date of 18 May 2000. The person named appealed this decision and the case is currently being reviewed. The person named will be informed of the outcome of this review as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A compliance inspection on 18 June 1998 revealed contraventions of the REP scheme by this participant incurring penalties which amounted to 110% of his annual payment. The agri-environmental specifications then governing the scheme provided that where penalties amounted to more than an annual payment, the farmer who incurred them had his or her participation in the scheme terminated and all aid paid up to then had to be refunded to the Department.</P>
      <P>The participant made an appeal and his case was reviewed by the national REPS appeals committee on 14 October 1999. The appeals committee upheld the original decision to terminate his participation and recoup all the aid he had received. The appeals committee is independent and its decisions are final.</P>
      <P>As the person named failed to repay the amount he owed, my Department has had no option but to make arrangements to recoup it from payments for which he is eligible under other schemes administered by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> My Department has no discretion to waive the penalty itself, which is a debt to EU funds. In the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, however, my Department is prepared to waive any further interest on the debt if the person named gives his agreement to the recoupment of the debt itself from payments under other schemes, or alternatively if he is prepared to make a commitment to repay the balance due and subsequently carries this out. If he wishes to repay the balance by instalments, my Department will consider a proposal to that effect. In the absence of agreed repayment arrangements, outstanding debts attract interest at an annual rate of 8% which is set by EU regulation. The person named has been informed of my Department's position as set out above.</P>

      <P>There is no supplementary measure of this kind in the new rural environmental protection scheme which commenced on 27 November 2000. Unlike the regulation governing the previous scheme, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, under which the new scheme is implemented, includes no provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme. Nevertheless, my Department, in an effort to secure the continued availability of public access as part of REPS, made proposals to the European Commission for the inclusion of the measure in the new scheme as a State aid fully funded by the Exchequer. However, the Commission has indicated that a public access measure was not admissible under the agri-environment title of Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, even as a State aid.</P>
      <P>Participants in the previous REP scheme who are currently in receipt of payment under supplementary measure 5 may continue to avail of payments under this measure until the end of their existing agreements.</P>

      <P>The person named lodged an incomplete application under the national scheme of installation aid on 15 January 1999. Outstanding documentation to support this application was sought on 26 May 1999 and on 8 February 2000, all of which was submitted by 8 August 2000. Due to pressure of work there has been some unavoidable delay in processing the completed application.</P>
      <P>A final examination of the documentation submitted is currently being carried out and if the application is found to be in order, payment will be made within the next four weeks.</P>
      <P>Question No. 424 answered with Question No. 363.</P>

      <P>The position is as outlined in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 200 on Tuesday, 17 October 2000. The scheme now outlined by the Deputy would again involve substantial extra funding over and above that already provided for under the agreed scheme.</P>
      <P>At my request, my officials are currently reviewing the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme with the aim of finding an equitable long-term solution to the problem of losses.</P>

      <P>The following schedule gives the numbers by location of civil servants currently on the transfer lists operated by this Department under general council report 782 for CPSU grades. My Department's experience of these lists is that they are not an accurate indication of current interest in a location as frequently the applicants' circumstances have changed by the time their place is reached on the list. In addition, these lists can show an exaggerated level of interest in locations as applicants usually apply for more than one location and also apply to every Department with an office at the required locations(s).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> My Department can have difficulty in filling clerical posts from the transfer lists despite applications for these locations.</P>

      <P>The competent authority in Ireland for approval of organophosphate based treatments for cattle is the Irish Medicines Board &ndash; IMB. The decision by the IMB on the authorisation of a given product is taken on the basis of relevant EU standards in relation to quality, safety and efficacy, where the benefits and risks associated with use of each medicine are evaluated. An authorisation issued by the IMB includes mandatory product labelling requirements, which, in the case of organophosphate based products, includes advice on the wearing of appropriate protective equipment by the user, as well as other warnings about contra-indications, environmental risks and protection of consumers.</P>
      <P>My Department has currently under consideration a report submitted by the IMB in April 2000 on organoposphate veterinary concentrates. In broad terms, this report endorses the safety of this category of product provided the information and advice contained on the label, particularly in relation to wearing adequate protective equipment, are followed. However, I can add that there are no longer any such organophosphate concentrated treatments authorised by IMB for the treatment of cattle. There are alternative non-organophosphate based treatments for cattle authorised by IMB. As with all veterinary medicines, users are advised to consult product labels and package inserts before use and to observe all the precautions for safe and proper storage, use and disposal.</P>

      <P>The rate of pension paid under the previous scheme of early retirement from farming was expressed in ECUs. The revaluation of the Irish pound on the introduction of the euro in January 1999 resulted in a reduction of some 5.05% in the rate of pension. While the reduction in the rate is permanent, the Council of Ministers approved a three year scheme of compensation. During 2000, full compensation was paid to all participants in the scheme whose payments had been reduced during 1999.</P>
      <P>On 12 January 2001, the European Commission gave approval for payment of compensation in respect of reductions in payments during 2000. Compensation is set at 75% of the loss incurred and the total amount approved for Ireland is £2.63 million. One third of this will be funded by the EU and the remainder from the Exchequer. Arrangements for payment are being put in place following receipt of the Commission's approval.</P>
      <P>The compensation scheme provides for a third payment in respect of reductions in payments during 2001 and approval for this payment will be sought from the European Commission in due course.</P>

      <P>The position is that £360 million additional funding has been committed to the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme over the period 2001 to 2006. This will increase the total value of the scheme to £1,080 million during that time. It is estimated that 109,000 farmers will qualify for payment under the new area based scheme compared with 90,000 under the old headage scheme. Total expenditure in the 2001 scheme will increase by some £60 million to £180 million. Some 81,000 farmers stand to gain under the new arrangements while about 28,000 will incur some losses. I have, however, negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss per farmer in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002. The compensation will be included in the payment due to each herdowner which will be made later in the year.</P>
      <P>At my request my officials are currently reviewing the scheme with a view to finding an equitable long-term solution to the problem of losses.</P>

      <P>Although data recording under the cattle movement monitoring system &ndash; CMMS &ndash; commenced in 1996, for a <Col N="343" /> variety of reasons, the data recorded on animal locations is not up to date in all cases. The entire purpose of the herd reconciliation project is to rectify this situation and to further improve the accuracy of the CMMS database so that it can be used more widely for future premia payments and to safeguard markets for Irish beef by ensuring its traceability.</P>
      <P>In compiling the herd reconciliation statements, all animal events recorded on computer in 2000 &ndash; births, calving, on-farm deaths, exports, slaughterings, movements, premia applications etc. &ndash; were used to establish a last known location for each animal tag number. The year 2000 was selected as a basis for the exercise because it provided the most comprehensive and up to date information available. By using 2000 as the basis for the project, certain categories of animals were either omitted from or included on the printed list. Categories omitted comprised, for example: animals born in 1998 or 1999 and still in the herd of origin on which no premium was due or claimed during 2000; cows that were not registered as dams in 2000; cattle whose movements into a herd were not notified to CMMS; calves born on or before 31 December 2000 and not yet registered; calf registrations, movement notifications, slaughterings and exports in the last weeks of December 2000 which were not yet up on CMMS.</P>

The feedback from most individual farmers has been very positive and I do not accept that a large number of complaints have been made by herdowners. Rather, farmers understand from the guidelines given to them why certain categories of animal may have been omitted from or included on the lists and have taken the opportunity presented to them to rectify inaccuracies.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the herd reconciliation project will enhance the accuracy of the CMMS database. It will also provide a more focused opportunity for the future to monitor the level of compliance with notification obligations and to address failures or inaccuracies in reporting.</P>

      <P>The records supplied by his dairy to my Department show that he held a milk quota of 11,806 gallons at 31 March 2000/1 April 2000. He declared on his suckler cow application that there were a total of 13 cows in his herd. To determine the number of cows required to fill the milk quota, the quota must be divided by 876 &ndash; the national average yield in gallons per cow. In the case of the person named the number of cows needed to fill the milk quota is 13.47. As all cows in the herd of the person named are required to fill the milk quota of 11,806 gallons he is not eligible for payment under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme of small scale milk producers.</P>

The Commission responded on 6 September 2000 with a request for additional information. The matter was then discussed in detail at meetings with the Commission and discussions in relation to the detailed content of the final reply are concluding with Commission officials at present. As things stand, it appears that it will take some more months before the business tax incentives elements of the scheme will be approved by the Commission.

Where a room or rooms in a person's principal private residence is let as residential accommodation and the gross annual rental income is less than £6,000 the rental income will be exempt from tax. The Bill will provide that room rentals coming within the scope of this scheme will not trigger a stamp duty clawback; nor will it affect full entitlement to CGT principal private residence relief, in the event of a subsequent disposal of the property, or full entitlement to mortgage interest relief.

      <P>Under existing legislation tax relief at the standard rate is available for tuition fees, up to £2,500 in the current tax year, paid for full-time qualifying undergraduate courses in another EU member state from 1999-2000 onwards and full-time and part-time postgraduate courses in a university or publicly funded college in another EU member state from 2000-2001 onwards.</P>
      <P>As regards undergraduate courses in another EU member state, a qualifying course is a course of at least two years duration in a publicly funded university or college. Courses in medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry or teacher training are excluded from the relief. To qualify for relief, a postgraduate course in another EU member state must be of at least one academic year, but not more than four academic years, in duration and must lead to a postgraduate award based on either a thesis or an examination. The person taking the course must already have a primary degree or an equivalent qualification. Tuition fees paid by the individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian qualify for relief. Relief is not available for any part of fees which are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, an employer or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector of taxes does not have sufficient information about the course being pursued by the taxpayer's daughter in Belfast to determine whether tax relief is due. The inspector has requested the taxpayer to furnish information <Col N="350" /> about the course. When this is received, the inspector will process the taxpayer's claim as quickly as possible. As I indicated in my Budget Statement for 2001, tax reliefs on the payment of fees for education courses are somewhat complex and I propose to rationalise and extend their operation in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I reduced the rates of excise duty on road diesel and unleaded petrol in the budget. The decrease in the rates took effect on and from 7 December 2000. All deliveries from authorised tax free warehouses for consumption after midnight on 6 December 2000 were, therefore, liable to duty at the post-budget rates. I have no plans to rebate excise duty paid by any petroleum supplier who took deliveries from such warehouses prior to budget night at the pre-budget rate.</P>

      <Quest>if any provisions in the taxation code allow universities to benefit from tax relief when providing on-campus crèche facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no specific measures designed to incentivise third level institutions to provide on-campus crèche facilities. However, I would remind the Deputy that in my 1999 budget I introduced capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child care premises that meet the required standards as set out in the Childcare Act, 1991. Thereafter, in the 2000 budget I provided for 100% accelerated capital allowances for expenditure incurred from 1 December 1999. This accelerated allowance is available to both owners of the child care facilities and also to investors who wish to invest by way of leasing arrangements. Where the qualifying expenditure is incurred by an individual investor, or group of such investors, subject to certain conditions, and the premises is leased to the operator of the childcare facility, any excess of capital allowances can be off set against the investor's other income subject to an annual £25,000 limit. No such limit applies in the case of expenditure incurred by owner operators or corporate investors. This tax relief measure applies to all crèches in the State regardless of where they are located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the 1999 Finance Act provided an exemption from a benefit-in-kind charge where employers provide free or subsidised child care for their employees. The exemption applies <Col N="351" /> where the employer makes a premises available or, if a joint scheme, is involved in both the management and financing of the child care facility.</P>
    <P>In my 2000 Budget Statement I said that I would be discussing with employer bodies how the rules for this scheme might be modified to secure further increased provision of child care facilities at a reasonable cost to the Exchequer. These discussions have taken place and I will be considering the issue further in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Pensioners will, of course, benefit from the general increases in the tax allowances/credits announced in the budget, that is, the doubling of the PAYE allowance to £2,000 and the £1,600 increase in the married personal allowance to £11,000. In addition couples aged over 65 have an age allowance of £1,600. In the recent budget I increased the tax exemption limits for a married couple aged 65 or over to £17,000 &ndash;  £327 per week &ndash; which compares favourably to the general exemption limit of £8,200 for couples under 65. The net effect of the improvements is that couples over 65 with one pension who are within the normal tax allowance system do not pay any tax on income up to £280 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the policy of widening of the standard rate band and putting it on a per person basis, which commenced in budget 2000, is designed to meet the objective, set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, that 80% of taxpayers should not pay tax at the higher rate. In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the social partners supported the policy of estab<Col N="352" /> lishing a single standard rate band for all individual taxpayers. The widening of the standard rate band does not lead to any taxpayer paying more tax.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 464 and 488 together.</P>
      <P>This case relates to the sale of a site in Shankill. The person concerned entered into a contract but failed to close the sale. The offer to refund half of the £10,000 deposit forfeited in accordance with the terms of the contract was made on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis but a response to it has not been received. No further offer is contemplated.</P>
      <P>The view that the Commissioners of Public Works were in any way responsible for failure to complete the sale is totally incorrect. The person in question was given every opportunity to complete the transaction and failed to do so. As the market conditions have changed considerably due to the long lapse of time since the original sale, it is not possible at this stage to proceed with a sale on the original terms. It is the intention to offer the property for sale on the open market shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My recent budget announced an additional £1.2 billion in social inclusion spending in full year terms. This was on top of substantial expenditure increases announced in the context of the Estimates and covering all aspects of public services, including housing, health and education.</P>
      <P>Within this overall context, the value of the social welfare improvements contained in the 2001 budget amounts to a record high of £850 million in a full year. This is more than double the previous year's budget package, which was a record in itself, and will bring estimated total expenditure by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to more than £6 billion in 2001, compared to £4.5 billion in 1997.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the 2001 budget, which is the first budget covering the three year period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, provides for very substantial progress towards the commitments made in the programme, including those in regard to social welfare rates generally and child benefit improvements.</P>
      <P>As outlined in An Action Plan for the Millennium, tax reductions are an integral part of the Government's strategy to maintain and improve competitiveness and to encourage the take up of employment. We have made considerable progress in this regard through a balanced strategy of removing more of the low paid from the tax net, by reducing tax rates, by ensuring that a large majority of taxpayers are subject to no more than the standard rate of income tax and by completing the transition to a more progressive system of tax credits. The tax changes announced in the 2001 budget will remove a further 133,000 people from the tax net, bringing the total number of income earners outside the tax net to 668,000 or 38% of all taxpayers. The substantial increase in tax credits and the reduction in the standard rate of tax will also reduce the tax burden for other lower income households. Moreover, since April 2000, all those earning less than £226 per week are exempt from PRSI and there is a commitment over time to remove all those on minimum pay from the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the tax year 2000-01 a single person pays no tax on the first £110 of income per week, whereas when the Government came to office a single person entered the tax net at £77. As of 6 April 2001 a single person will not enter the tax net until they have earned in excess of £144 per week. I am confident that the 2001 Estimates and budget <Col N="355" /> will consolidate the very welcome progress which has been made to date on poverty reduction and social inclusion. This has seen the numbers experiencing consistent poverty, as targeted by the national anti-poverty strategy, fall from 9%-15% in 1994 to 6%-8% in 1998, the latest date for which figures are available and since when there have been further substantial reductions in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. Indeed, employment remains the single most effective weapon in tackling poverty.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the overall budget tax measures will enhance the reward from working and leave far more net pay in the taxpayer's pocket. The further widening of the standard rate income tax band will also add to the reward from taking up employment for those not yet in the labour force.</P>
      <P>Regarding child care expenses, as I said in my 2001 Budget Statement, the Government's core objective is to provide support which will offer real choice to parents and will benefit all our children. This can be done through child benefit. I announced, therefore, that the child benefit rates for first and second children are being increased by £25 to £67.50 per month and by £30 to £86 per month for third and subsequent children. The new rates will be payable from next June, which is three months earlier than usual. These increases are a first step in a three year process which will see investment in the child benefit payment rise by £1 billion by 2003. The substantially increased level of resources invested in the scheme over the next three years will mean that the PPF commitment to move towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children will have been implemented by 2003.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of child care facilities, the Government has already put in place a wide range of measures to increase the supply of child care places in all parts of the country. The national development plan includes £250 million for child care and the Government subsequently allocated a further £40 million for this purpose. To facilitate early action, this spending is being front-loaded through the allocation of £104 million in the Estimates for next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2001 budget also provided for an increased allocation to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from £20 million last year to £74 million this year for the expansion of programmes including capital grants for commercial crèches and for community based child care facilities, staffing grants for community based projects and a national childminders' initiative. Finally, the 2001 budget extended the period of paid maternity and adoptive leave by four weeks and doubled the period of unpaid leave from its current level to eight weeks effective from April 2001. This extension means that a mother can take up to six months leave in the period around the birth or adoption of her child. All of these <Col N="357" /> measures make further advances in the area of supports of parents to assist them in reconciling their work and family lives.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question dated 4 October 2000, the Commissioners of Public Works have no responsibility for maintenance of the river in question as it lies outside the boundaries of the Moy catchment drainage scheme. I understand that my officials had previously advised the Deputy that the Western Regional Fisheries Board proposed to clean a drain adjacent to the affected property which could help to alleviate the problem and that Mayo County Council were investigating road flooding in the area. As the Deputy is aware, I asked an Office of Public Works engineer to visit the property owner in December arising from the Deputy's representations and to advise him to contact the county council in the matter. It is suggested that he pursue this course, if he has not already done so.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 99/85/EC authorises member states to apply a reduced rate of VAT as low as 5% for a maximum period of three years between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2002 to a very restricted number of services, such as repairing bicycles, shoes and leather goods, clothing and household linen, including mending and alteration, renovation and repairing of private dwellings excluding materials which form a significant part of the value of the supply, window cleaning and cleaning in private households, domestic care services, for example, home help and care of the young, elderly, sick or disabled, and hairdressing. The services concerned must be labour intensive, largely provided direct to consumers, mainly local and not likely to create distortions of competition and there must be a close link between the lower prices resulting from the rate reduction and the foreseeable increase in demand and employment.</P>
      <P>Ireland was fully supportive of this directive but decided not to participate as most of our labour intensive services are subject to the reduced VAT rate of 12.5%. The Government is also committed to retaining a low rate for labour intensive services and we will be closely examining any proposals in this respect which may emerge in 2003. Member states which wanted to participate were required to inform the Commission before 1 November 1999. It is therefore no longer possible to participate in the scheme at this stage. It is intended that before 31 December 2002 the Commission shall forward a global evaluation report to the Council and Parliament accompanied, if necessary, by a proposal for appropriate measures for a final decision on the VAT rate applicable to labour intensive services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for income tax purposes, ESB meter readers are regarded as employees under a contract of service and their earnings are subject to tax under the PAYE system.</P>
      <P>The treatment of meter readers for social insurance purposes is governed by the Social Welfare Acts. I understand that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regards the meter readers to be in insurable self-employment for the purposes of the Social Welfare Acts. Such determinations are not formally binding on Revenue.</P>
      <P>The Revenue determination of the tax status of the meter readers has also been upheld by the appeal commissioners. The ESB altered its contracts with meter readers in 1995 and the Revenue Commissioners examined the new contracts in order to determine whether the status of the meter readers had changed for the purposes of tax law. The result of the examination was that the new contracts did not change the meter readers' tax status in that they continued to be engaged under a contract of service and, as a consequence, should remain within the scope of the PAYE system.</P>
      <P>I understand that following discussions with the ESB and taking the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs decisions into account, Revenue reached an agreement with the ESB which, by concession and subject to certain conditions, including conditions regarding withholding of tax by the ESB, treats the meter readers as self-employed.</P>

Therefore, persons who are on the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour and with a normal working week of, say, 39 hours, will have earnings below this exemption limit and consequently are not liable for PRSI.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the proposed abolition of the employers and self-employed PRSI contribution ceilings from 6 April next, the question of an adjustment to take account of the shorter tax year does not arise in these instances.</P>
      <P>As far as employee PRSI is concerned, the issue is of relevance only to the minority &ndash; an estimated 13% &ndash; who will have annual earnings above the contribution ceiling of £28,250 which will apply from next April. When annual earnings are in excess of the relevant contribution ceiling, employees have a period in each contribution year in which no contribution is due, sometimes referred to as the PRSI holiday, the duration of which depends on the level of annual earnings and the point in the tax year at which the earnings ceiling is reached. Up to this, PRSI holidays tended to be concentrated mainly in the first quarter of the calendar year in the lead up to the end of the tax year on 5 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the decision to align the tax and calendar years from January 2002, relevant employees could have expected a contribution holiday in the first quarter of 2002. Arising from this alignment, their contribution holiday will be deferred until the final quarter of 2002. Leaving the contribution ceiling intact for the short calendar year does not impose any additional PRSI liability on the employees involved as they will continue to have two PRSI holidays over the two year period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002 as they would have had prior to the changeover; although <Col N="362" /> the second holiday period will now mainly be in the final quarter of 2002.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would remind the Deputy, that most employees will benefit from a reduction of 0.5% to 4% in the contribution rate of PRSI, effective from 6 April 2001.</P>

      <P>The central objective of the action plan for the information society, which was approved by Government in July 1999 was, and continues to be, to make Ireland one of the leaders in the emerging information society. The plan identified a number of key initiatives and assigned specific responsibility to a number of Departments for their achievement. These include, <i>inter alia</i>, initiatives to improve access to and to address social inclusion &ndash; Taoiseach, electronic delivery of integrated public services &ndash; Taoiseach, Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs &ndash; reach and the introduction of electronic procurement across all of the public service &ndash; Finance. <Col N="363" /> The highlights of my Department's involvement in this process include the provision and administration of action plan funding, the procurement of telecommunications infrastructure for on-line Government services and the development of an e-procurement system.</P>
      <P>The centre for management and organisation development in my Department administers the action plan fund &ndash; £46 million for 2001 &ndash; and chairs the team that evaluates project proposals from Departments and offices. Funding of £3.26 million has been assigned to projects in my Department.</P>
      <P>A key requirement in the provision of electronic services is a quality telecommunications infrastructure for all sectors of government. Work is at an advanced stage in the acquisition of this service. E-procurement by public service agencies has been identified by, among others, IBEC and Forfás as being key to the wider implementation of electronic commerce in Ireland. It has the potential for significantly reducing procurement costs in public sector agencies through bulk buying discounts, reduced administrative overheads and further improving and standardising procurement practices in agencies. An interdepartmental committee, chaired by the procurement section in my Department, has been set up to explore and develop the potential of e-procurement for use by all public sector purchasers. The ultimate aim of the project is to establish access to procurement opportunities in the public sector supporting all stages of the procurement process and to facilitate ease of use both by suppliers and contracting authorities. As a first step this year, a website containing all procurement opportunities will be available. This is under construction and will be in place in the next week. Funding of £1.3 million has been provided for this project. In tandem a longer term project with appropriate funding has commenced with external consultants and public servants which is exploring new processes and a more streamlined solution to procurement within the public sector. This should be in place in early 2002 and will include an electronic procurement facility for the public service, which will provide facilities for the publication of procurement opportunities, providing downloadable tender documentation, publication of results of procurement competitions, documentation on general procurement requirements and facilities for on-line submission of tenders.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department is contributing to the work of the REACH agency and is working with the OASIS, On-line Access to Services Information and Support, project in the improvement of access to information. Internally, an e-strategy is being developed which covers the cross departmental role played by my Department and the internal systems that can be enhanced to deliver services to clients in a electronic form.</P>

      <P>In general the Department aims to have responses to e-mails sent out in line with our customer service standards. Under our customer service standards action plan, the Department introduced a code of practice for handling correspondence from members of the public. This code of practice, which also applies to e-mails, ensures that all correspondence is replied to promptly and with courtesy. The main e-mail address for inquiries to the Department of Finance is webmaster@finance.irlgov.ie, although for the convenience of our clients e-mail addresses for different sections and officials of the Department and for the Minister for Finance are also posted to the website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> In the last quarter of 2000 approximately 800 e-mails were sent to the webmaster mailbox alone. These were opened by staff of the press office and were responded to immediately where possible, or forwarded to the relevant sections of the Department for direct reply. It is not possible to provide the Deputy with the exact number of e-mails not responded to by 19 January. This is due to a number of factors. A number of e-mails are replied to but for technical reasons the e-mail does not transmit due to a fault with the intended recipient's e-mail address or some other technical problem. In certain circumstances e-mails do not require a response, for example, multiple versions of the same e-mail or the type of junk mail or advertising circulars that are in no way relevant or appropriate to the business of the Department of Finance. The Department is a member of the QCS Officers Network which operates under the SMI unit in the Department of the Taoiseach. The issue of ensuring a quality customer service to members of the public who e-mail the Department is currently under discussion at this network group.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the context for the recent taxation measures on housing, including these stamp duty measures, is the difficult housing market situation. These market conditions, which are fully elaborated on in the most recent study into the housing market by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, Economic Consultants, required prompt action. In particular there was a pressing need to strengthen the position of first time owner-occupier buyers compared to investors. The third Bacon report pointed to speculative demand which was helping to drive up housing prices. The restructuring of the stamp duty regime to benefit owner-occupiers as against investors is one of the measures designed to help first time and other owner-occupier buyers.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rate payable by investors &ndash; compared with the previous rates that applied &ndash; will of course depend on the price of the house. The Government decided to apply this flat rate of 9% to all non owner-occupier purchasers of new and second-hand residential property irrespective of the value of the property as it was considered that the previous graduated scale of rates might encourage investments in the lower end of the market. This would not be a desirable development from the point of view of the first time owner-occupier purchaser as it would bring further pressure on prices at the lower end of the market.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty is applied on a once-off basis only. It is applied on a class basis to a range of items, <Col N="367" /> for example, to transfers of Irish shares, to mortgages, to non-life insurance policies as well as to property and is therefore not a taxation that lends itself to exemptions on a regional basis. Any attempt to introduce such an exemption would raise equity considerations concerning the tax treatment of individuals in different areas. There is also a serious risk that such an exemption could lead to distortions in the housing market. These could hinder the overall national goal of increasing the supply of new homes especially to meet the needs of first time buyers who are trying to get a foothold in the housing market.</P>
    <P>It is too early to judge the impact of this measure and to make any changes in this regard. However, the stamp duty regime will be kept under review in the light of changing circumstances in the housing market. The latest package of measures should assist in restoring balance in the housing market and curbing excessive price-increases. This price moderation is in the interests of all in the property sector whether first time buyer, owner occupier or investor.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not received an application for relief under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, from the person referred to by the Deputy. It is a fundamental requirement for relief from tax under the regulations that the disabled person meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. The Revenue Commissioners cannot even consider an application for relief without the issue of this certificate. In cases where the issue of a primary medical certificate is refused it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, an independent body, whose decision is final. I understand that the person concerned was refused the issue of a primary medical certificate and that this refusal was appealed to the board of appeal. It is also understood that the person was assessed by the board on 27 October 1999 where it was found that the specified medical criteria for the relief were not met and the appeal was refused accordingly. It is of course open to the person to reapply for the required certificate at some time in the future if it is felt that his/her medical condition has changed to the extent that the medical criteria for the relief may be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> I have arranged for the Revenue Commissioners to forward a copy of the information leaflet VRT 7, which sets out in detail the medical and other requirements of this scheme, directly to the Deputy.</P>

Please note that the above offices are the only ones under the aegis of this Department who have civil servants on transfer lists to sections outside of Dublin. It should be noted that an officer may have applied to go to more than one location and also to more than one Department in the required location. Therefore the lists may not be an accurate indication of the real interest in a specific location.</P>

      <P>Following is a table which was included in the budget 2001 book, page C30. The table outlines the personal tax credits and standard rate bands which will apply for the tax year 2001. Due to the move to a calendar year basis, we will have a short tax year in 2001 and therefore, the short year equivalents are also shown.</P>

    <P>The EU budget is largely funded by payments from member states known as own resources. These are comprised of traditional own resources &ndash; customs duties, agricultural levies and sugar levies &ndash; a VAT resource and a GNP resource. Ireland's VAT resource payments to the EU budget are not a fixed percentage of Ireland's VAT receipts. The VAT resource is a certain percentage of each member states' VAT base calculated on a harmonised basis. However, a system of capping of the bases in terms of percentages of GNP is in place to help neutralise discrepancies between the VAT bases of different member states. Ireland's VAT base has been capped at 50% of GNP since 1995. In other words, when the Irish VAT base, on a harmonised basis, is greater than 50% of GNP in a given year, Ireland's liability to the EU budget in respect of the VAT resource is calculated by applying the percentage call up rate to 50% of GNP, rather than to the actual VAT base. Finally, the percentage maximum call-up rate for the VAT resource was reduced in even steps from 1.32% in 1995 to 1% in 1999.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to the EU budget in respect of the VAT resource for each of the years 1996-2000 is set out as follows:<Col N="372" /></P>

      <P>The drain in question is on a scheduled channel of the Moy catchment drainage scheme and is maintainable by the Commissioners of Public Works. I am advised that the commissioners will undertake a survey to ascertain the maintenance requirement as soon as conditions permit, probably in April of this year.</P>
      <P>The bridge was constructed during the Moy catchment drainage scheme works as a replacement for the then existing bridge on the through road between Ardhoom and Meelick, County Mayo. Responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of the bridge remained with Mayo County Council on completion of the works. Consequently, responsibility for removing or widening the bridge rests with the local authority.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, according to information received by the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer is not married to his partner. There is no provision in tax law under which a taxpayer can claim an allowance in respect of financial support given to a partner to whom the taxpayer is not married.</P>
      <P>A taxpayer who is a single parent may claim the one-parent family allowance for a qualifying child. A qualifying child is a child (a) born in the year of assessment, (b) who, at the commencement of the year of assessment, is under the age of 18 years, or (c) who, if over the age of 18 years at the commencement of the year of assessment, is in full-time education or permanently incapacitated. A child who is not the child of the claimant but who is in the custody of the claimant and is maintained by the claimant at the claimant's own expense for the whole or part of the year of assessment is also regarded as a qualifying child. The one-parent family allowance cannot be claimed where the taxpayer is living with another person as husband and wife.</P>

      <P>Chapter 1, Part 18 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for a withholding tax to be deducted from payments made by certain bodies for professional services. Professional services withholding tax , PSWT, is deducted by accountable persons from relevant payments made by them to specified persons in respect of professional services. The following are accountable persons: Government Departments and offices, local authorities, including health boards, vocational education committees and the GMS and commercial and non-commercial semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forfás is an accountable person for the purposes of the legislation. Accordingly, payments made by Forfás for professional services are subject to PSWT. It would appear that Forfás was satisfied that the service provided by the taxpayer was a professional service for the purposes of <Col N="374" /> PSWT and tax was deducted accordingly. PSWT is not an additional tax but a deduction on account of a taxpayer's final liability, made at the point of payment. On presentation of the necessary forms to their tax office, taxpayers will receive full credit for all PSWT deducted. For individual taxpayers assessable to income tax, this credit is given in the tax year in which the PSWT was deducted. For companies assessable to corporation tax, the credit is given in the accounting period in which PSWT was deducted.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is the driver, and £12,500 if the passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of excise on up to 600 gallons of fuel and for an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme cost £22 million in 2000, excluding the annual road tax costs.</P>
      <P> The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April next, and from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme will be unable to also avail of the mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme already have access to transport, which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages. Accordingly, I do not propose to remove the restriction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The PAYE allowance was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers. It took account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis and also the case made by ICTU that the general scheme of allowances discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. The allowance was extended in the 1994 Finance Act to children of proprietary directors who previously were ineligible for the allowance. To qualify for the allowance children of proprietary directors, other than a child who is himself/herself a proprietary director, must be full-time employees throughout the year in the business of their parents with earnings of at least £3,600 per annum.</P>
      <P>The granting of the PAYE allowance to proprietary directors would lead to calls for the extension of the allowance to the self-employed generally. Such an extension would not be appropriate given that self-employed persons are taxed on a different basis to PAYE taxpayers which may have certain advantages. For example, although the self employed now pay tax on a current year basis, there still can be timing benefits in relation to payment and finalisation of the tax. Consequently I have no plans at present to extend the PAYE allowance to other categories of taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Given the global nature of the Internet, dealing with e-mail viruses is now almost an everyday occurrence. My Department has a stringent policy and procedure for dealing with these. It has a three-tier anti-virus software architecture in place which is updated monthly as a matter of course and on any other occasion when new viruses become known. All staff are required to remain vigilant, to ensure that they always virus-check material received from outside the Department and not to open or execute material that has not been subjected to a virus check. When viruses are <Col N="379" /> detected by the anti-virus software system, they are quarantined and deleted as a matter of procedure. As a result, it is not possible to furnish the Deputy with exact numbers of viruses occurring in incoming e-mails.</P>

      <P>My Department's e-mail infrastructure has not been breached by hackers in the past 12 months. On one occasion, a student did attempt to send me thousands of e-mails. However, the e-mail security and filtering mechanisms in place allowed my Department to detect and stop this very early and, as a result, no disruption occurred. Officials in my Department ensured that the student's university was alerted of the attempt. The university immediately launched an investigation which resulted in the student apologising for the action.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme which comes under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is a driver, and £12,500 if the qualifying person is a passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of <Col N="380" /> excise duty on up to 600 gallons of fuel per year and for an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme is worth some £22 million per annum to the beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April 2001, and from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme will be unable to also avail of the mobility allowance.</P>
      <P>By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme already have access to transport, which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at eligible people with disabilities who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>

    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): I propose to take Questions Nos. 515, 544, 552, 558, 581, 582, 642, 654, 655, 697 and 726 together.</P>
    <P>I understand that the final report of the Ombudsman on the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme, a draft of which has been the subject of media reports referred to by Deputies, is being published this afternoon and Deputies will appreciate that I am not in a position to respond in detail until I have had an opportunity to have the findings of the report fully examined in my Department. I can, however, inform Deputies of a number of steps taken to remedy shortcomings in the subvention scheme in so far as they adversely affected people in nursing homes and their families.</P>
    <P>Deputies have raised the issue of the payment of refunds to subvention recipients or their families arising from the incorrect application of Article 8.2 of the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations, 1993, which allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to 1/5 of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid. The making of payments arising from the assessment of family circumstances has also been raised.</P>
    <P>In relation to the operation of Article 8.2, an additional allocation of £4 million was made available in the 1998 letters of determination to six of the eight health boards, where the regulations were applied incorrectly, to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and subsequent regulations. The breakdown of this allocation was as follows:</P>

    <P>I should explain that the sum of £4 million was not provided solely for the purposes of Article 8.2 arrears. Health boards were also incurring additional expenditure as a result of the easing of family circumstances regulations in 1996. The funding was intended to address both problems and to meet funding shortfalls in the scheme generally.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting with the Office of the Ombudsman in December 1999, the Department became aware of continuing delays in paying arrears. The Department took the matter up with the relevant boards and is continuing to pursue the matter. The current position is that where arrears were due to be paid, health boards have made retrospective payments in respect of persons currently resident in nursing homes. Some <Col N="383" /> boards have also paid arrears in respect of former subvention recipients now deceased and former recipients who are no longer resident in nursing homes. The Department has instructed the relevant boards to take immediate steps to pay all outstanding arrears. To date a total of approximately £900,000 has been paid out in respect of Article 8.2 arrears. It is not possible at this stage to give a figure for the total cost of Article 8.2 arrears payments as a number of boards have not as yet completed the process of calculating the amounts due. I assure Deputies that every effort will be made to pay all outstanding arrears as soon as possible and I have instructed my Department to pursue this with the health boards concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies also raised the issue of how the £4 million allocated in 1998 was used by health boards. As I indicated, this allocation was not intended to be used solely for the payment of Article 8.2 arrears. The Department has been informed by the health boards concerned that the funding provided was used to cover arrears payments under Article 8.2; additional expenditure arising as a result of the easing of the family circumstances regulations in 1996; the payment of enhanced subventions; expenditure shortfalls arising from increasing demands under the scheme and legal and other costs associated with the administration of the scheme. A proportion of the allocation was used by three of the health boards to fund other services for older people i.e. the provision of aids and appliances, mainly incontinence wear, improved home help services and the opening of a unit for the elderly mentally infirm. While this money was not expended on the subvention scheme, it was used for the benefit of older people.</P>
    <P>I also wish to inform Deputies that arrangements are being made to make appropriate payments in respect of nursing home patients and their families who may have been affected by the family circumstances regulations prior to their amendment in 1999. This amendment removed the provision which allowed health boards assess the capacity of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent. A group representing the Department and the health boards/ERHA has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis. As this will be a complex exercise involving difficult issues of traceability, it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible. I should add that the legal advice available to me is that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances. Nevertheless, in the interests of fairness to the people concerned, the Minister and I have decided on this course of action.</P>
    <P>The findings contained in the Ombudsman's final report will be fully considered by my Department. An expenditure review of the <Col N="384" /> scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. It is my intention to bring forward proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from these reports and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise again that the immediate priority is to ensure that shortcomings which adversely affected nursing home patients and their families are addressed. The steps which I have outlined to the House in relation to the calculation and making of payments by health boards will I hope reassure Deputies that this matter is being given the highest priority.</P>

      <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, provide a system for regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts <Col N="385" /> in accordance with public health criteria. The regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. They regulate the granting of contracts with a view to (1) bringing Ireland into line with other EU-EEA states where such controls exist in one form or another, (2) improving standards in existing pharmacies and (3) promoting patient access to pharmacy services in rural areas. Because of the absence of any controls in regard to the granting of contracts, Ireland has been compelled to continue a derogation from the free movement of pharmacists directive.</P>
      <P>The regulations came into force in tandem with the introduction of a new contract for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which is proactive in promoting a quality driven service to the patient. I have no doubt that the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement which imposes obligations not in place before. A central and innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. The contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
      <P>Because of public health considerations, pharmacy services and the licensing and supply of pharmaceutical products is one of the most heavily regulated services throughout the world. I am satisfied that an unregulated system, in addition to being out of step with arrangements elsewhere in Europe, would lead to a diminution of the quality of professional community pharmacy services. I met recently with officials of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union during which, <i>inter alia</i>, the current regulations were discussed. There was general agreement that the time was opportune to review the operation of the regulations to see if they had fully achieved the desired effects and this is being undertaken as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>The appropriate balance to be struck between public safety considerations and the general desire to remove any unnecessary obstacles to competition will be considered in the context of the review.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons in Counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. The Western Health Board's orthodontic department is staffed by one consultant orthodontist and four dentists who are undergoing training in orthodontics. They are each supported by a dental surgery assistant. In addition, a principal dental surgeon carries out orthodontic work in Mayo, on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>At present there are 2,426 patients receiving orthodontic treatment from the Western Health Board.</P>

    <P>Of these 2,272 patients, 293 have been waiting less than one year, 581 have been waiting one to two years, 995 have been waiting two to three years and 403 have been waiting more than three years.</P>
    <P>The current waiting list situation arose primarily as a result of staff vacancies three years ago when the consultant orthodontist and two dentists left the service. Unavoidable delays in recruitment of replacement staff created a backlog, which is now being actively addressed. The situation has been exacerbated by the increased demand for services in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have long recognised that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran report (Review of Orthodontic Services) structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services to allow the targets set out in the dental health action plan to be achieved. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The Western Health Board has been allocated additional funds of £0.495 million for orthodontic services this year. This will enable the board to <Col N="387" /> tackle its orthodontic waiting lists by means of contractual arrangements with private orthodontists and by increasing the capacity of the board's own in-house orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>The health board estimates that these initiatives will allow for approximately 800 patients to be taken off the waiting lists during 2001. The objective is to reduce the treatment waiting period to not more than 12 months over the next three years. This is an internationally acceptable standard of service response.</P>

      <P>Following a meeting last month with representatives of state enrolled nurses, SENs, I have approved the provision of a grant of £6,000 to any SEN employed in our health services who undertakes a nursing conversion course in the United Kingdom. Payment of this grant will be made in return for a commitment on the part of the SENs concerned that they will work as nurses here following successful completion of the conversion course and registration as a nurse with the UK registering authority and with An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>I also wish to confirm that those SENs who successfully complete the nursing conversion programme at Chester College which they commenced in February 2000 will benefit from this new nurse recruitment initiative. A number of Deputies have previously tabled questions on behalf of this particular group, and I am pleased to provide an assurance that they will be eligible for grant support on the same basis as SENs commencing nursing conversion courses this year.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 upwards, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
      <P>Currently, I have no plans to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card in this instance. It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. The Deputy may be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The information sought by the Deputy in relation to costs in not readily available in my Department and I will write to him directly on the issue.</P>

      <P>The report on the Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease was prepared by a subgroup of the National Cancer Forum. It recommends the development of centres of excellence for the specialist treatment of breast disease. The report refers to the strong evidence which exists that women with breast cancer are at a lower risk of relapse and have a better opportunity of long-term survival if they are treated in a multidisciplinary setting. This means that surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, medical oncologists, radiotherapists, plastic surgeons, nurses, counsellors and others all bring expertise together to provide the best care for each patient.</P>
      <P>Having considered the report, I established an expert advisory group to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating the health boards implementation plans for the development of specialist breast units. This advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins met with all health boards towards the end of last year. The health boards are now formulating their plans for the development of the services in their own regions and a number of submissions have been received from health boards which are under consideration by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I allocated £4.315 million from national cancer strategy funding in the current year to enable the development of centres of excellence to commence in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, in Portlaoise General Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Waterford Regional Hospital, University College Hospital Galway and in the Southern Health Board area. The development of centres of excellence for the treatment of breast disease will continue over a period of a number of years and will form part of the next phase of implementation of the national cancer strategy. I am committed to providing the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 526, 615 and 732 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. The placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident. Accordingly, my Department has no function in relation to the setting of private nursing home fees.</P>
    <P>There are three rates of subvention payable (£70, £95 and £120) in accordance with three levels of dependency (medium, high and maximum). The amount of funding allocated to supporting people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years, from £23.8 million in 1998 to £33.1 million in 1999 to £38.5 million in 2000. A further £14 million is being provided in 2001, bringing the total funding available to £52.5 million. As I advised the House in my response to a parliamentary question of 7 December last, it is the intention to increase the rate of subvention in respect of private nursing homes by 25% with effect from 1 April 2001. The new rates will be £90, £120 and £150.</P>
    <P>On the question of an overall review of the scheme, I should explain that an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. The findings of this review, which is expected to be completed shortly, will be examined in the Department for the purposes of determining what action requires to be taken in relation to the future operation of this scheme.</P>

      <P>Research into the incidence of Down's Syndrome is conducted for the Eastern Regional Health Authority by the Dublin EUROCAT registry, which collects congenital anomaly data, including Down's syndrome, on all births to mothers in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. Data on incidences of Down's syndrome is also collected for the Western Health Board by the Galway EUROCAT registry, which collects the same data on all births to mothers for Galway only. There are no statistics available from other regions similar to the EUROCAT registries in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the number in each of the above counties is attached. The figures for Galway are in respect of 1996, 1997 and 1998. I will forward the figures for 1999 and 2000 when they are received from the Western Health Board to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>My Department's customer service action plan sets out the standards of service applying to all correspondence, including e-mail queries. The Department undertakes to provide a reply to issues raised within 20 working days. If it is not possible to meet this time scale because the complexity of the issue raised requires in-depth and detailed consideration, an appropriate interim reply will be provided. Staff make every effort to provide a quality service in accordance with this plan. Each officer in the Department has access to e-mail facilities. This enables each to deal with e-mail queries from the public and where appropriate to e-mail a reply directly.</P>
    <P>In the last quarter of 2000, the number of e-mails received amounted to almost 1,400. Our records indicate that more than 95% of these have had their queries answered or have been informed that their query is receiving attention. The remainder are being processed.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My role and responsibility in this area relates to the imple<Col N="394" /> mentation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and provide for notification to, and inspection by, health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services. Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on, or proposing to carry on, a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
      <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and the provision of family support services.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister for Finance, announced additional measures to increase the supply of child care places. Under these measures my Department is to receive £1.2 million to facilitate health boards in introducing a voluntary notification and support system that will be aimed at childminders looking after three or fewer children who are not covered by the notification and inspection requirements of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, the Minister for Finance also announced measures to help parents with child care responsibilities. These include child benefit rates, which are payable by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, being increased as follows:&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)by £25 per month for first and second children, from £42.50 to £67.50;</P>
      <P>(ii)by £30 per month for third and subsequent children, from £56 to £86.</P>
      <P>These increases are being paid from June 2001, or three months earlier than previously. Similar child benefit increases will be paid in both 2002 and 2003, bringing the rates to £117.50 and £146.00 respectively during 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for co-ordinating child care service delivery over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and his Department has been allocated £250 million for its equal opportunities child care <Col N="395" /> programme to invest in the development of child care service provision. The objectives of the programme are to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities, increase the number of child care places and improve the quality of services available. Funding is being provided for the following initiatives: capital grants to establish, maintain, renovate, and /or upgrade and staff community based and not-for-profit child care facilities; capital grants for self-employed private child care providers to build, renovate or upgrade facilities catering for not more than 20 children at any one time; grants towards the development of local child care networks; grants to enhance the services of the national voluntary child care organisations; grants to encourage and promote local child care training models that assist in the enhancement of quality child care provision; and innovative projects identified over the course of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In October 2000, the Government allocated an additional £40 million to address gaps in existing schemes. This funding will allow for additional supports for community-based facilities, capital grants for private providers of more than 20 child care places, grants for schools to create after school programmes, funding for local authorities to develop child care facilities in conjunction with local authority housing, a national childminders initiative and the development of a specialist training model for child care workers.</P>
    <P>In addition, accelerated capital allowances, at the rate of 100% in the first year, apply in relation to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 on child care facilities which meet the required standards as provided under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 and 719.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons on waiting lists at the <Col N="396" /> end of September 2000 was 29,657, which represents a reduction of 19.5% on the end of December 1999 quarter. This welcome reduction is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists. The total numbers on in-patient waiting lists by health board and hospital at 30 September 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, and the average waiting times in target specialities for both adults and children are being communicated separately to Deputy McManus. The hospital in-patient waiting list figures collected by my Department do not include private patients.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001 following the significant success experienced in this area last year. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>
    <P>The waiting list initiative funding for 2001 has been made available to health agencies in conjunction with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative, the national bed capacity review and the winter initiative investment. In this regard, I was pleased to announce an investment package of £25 million to address a number of key service issues in the acute and non acute sectors. The investment is being targeted at a number of areas, including the provision of additional step down facilities for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment. Many of these patients are older people and require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment.</P>
    <P>Under the winter initiative, at least 500 additional nursing home places will be contracted from private nursing homes. I am satisfied that this element of the initiative will increase the capacity of the acute hospital sector to address the problem of inappropriate use of hospital beds and will enhance the level of extended care available. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and more importantly waiting times.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 533, 534 and 535 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's immunisation policy is based on the advice of the national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The current guidelines from the national immunisation committee strongly recommend vaccination against influenza for persons aged 65 years or older and for adults and children (over six months) with any of the following conditions:</P>
      <P>&ndash;chronic illness requiring regular medical follow-up (e.g. chronic respiratory disease, including cystic fibrosis, moderate or severe asthma, chronic heart disease, diabetes mellitus etc.);</P>
      <P>&ndash;immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, including asplenia or splenic dysfunction;</P>
      <P>&ndash;children and teenagers on long-term aspirin therapy (because of risk of Reyes Syndrome);</P>
      <P>&ndash;residents of nursing homes, old peoples' homes, and other long stay facilities where rapid spread is likely to follow introduction of infection.</P>
      <P>These guidelines have been circulated to general practitioners through the health boards. Influenza vaccine is available free of charge from general practitioners to medical card holders in the above at-risk groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fee payable to general practitioners for administering the influenza vaccine to at-risk medical card holders is £21.94. Where the vaccine <Col N="398" /> is given at the same time as the pneumococcal vaccine, a fee of £32.91 is paid for the administration of both vaccines. Where the patient in the at-risk group is not a medical card holder, there is no charge for the vaccine itself. The question of a fee for administering the vaccine is a matter between the general practitioner and the patient.</P>

      <Quest>if he will explain the variation in figures supplied by the Irish Medicines Board in replies to Parliamentary Question No. 177 of 20 June 2000 and No. 134 of 18 October 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 537 and 538 together.</P>
      <P>The information given in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 136 of 28 June 2000 was in respect of the number of adverse reactions to Trivax vaccine recorded by each health board in the years 1972 to 1996, in so far as it was available at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Parliamentary Question No. 177 of 20 June and No. 134 of 18 October 2000, the information given in my replies was based on information provided by the Irish Medicines Board, IMB. The 91 suspected adverse drug reaction reports referred to in Parliamentary Question No. 134 is the overall number of reports received by the IMB whereas the information <Col N="399" /> given in Parliamentary Question No. 177 refers to the individual suspected reactions recorded.</P>
    <P>Adverse drug reaction reports may include more than one suspected adverse reaction. On receipt of the Deputy's question my Department sought clarification from the IMB. The IMB has indicated that there were 198 reactions specified in respect of the 91 adverse reaction reports it received. This updates the figure of 120 reactions referred to in Parliamentary Question No. 177. The Deputy will be aware that there was some delay in compiling the information given in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 134 as the IMB had to obtain the original records from the archives in order to ensure that the information provided was as complete and comprehensive as possible. The IMB has indicated that this reflects the most complete information available to it. I hope I have clarified the situation for the Deputy and I apologise for any confusion which my earlier replies may have caused.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the pharmacovigilance monitoring system may only receive limited information about suspected adverse reactions, as it is dependent on the level of information supplied by the health professional making the report and the timeliness with which the report is submitted. In some instances the reports are made quite some time after the administration of the product. The making of reports under the system does not establish a causal link between administration of the product and the reported symptoms or illness.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has informed me that it is aware of some documentation issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States regarding controls in relation to the use of bovine derived materials and BSE. It has indicated that it is not clear exactly to which letter the Deputy is referring. However, the Irish Medicines Board supports the European view and current EU policy which only completely excludes bovine materials from high risk BSE areas, specifically the United Kingdom and Portugal. Bovine materials from areas with lower levels of BSE are permitted &ndash; these include Ireland and Denmark &ndash; provided that the materials comply with the relevant EU guidelines and Directives <Col N="400" /> regarding minimising the risk of transmitting such agents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority in this country for the authorisation, control and supervision of medicinal products placed on the market. Under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, which give effect in this country to EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC, medicinal products, including vaccines, on the market in this country must be the subject of product authorisations granted by the Irish Medicines Board. Before the board will grant an authorisation, it must be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board monitors the use of all authorised medicinal products on an on-going basis via a range of post authorisation mechanisms. With a view to minimising the risk of transmitting animal Spongiform Encephalopathy agents via medicinal products, the board required all authorisation holders to demonstrate that their medicinal products were manufactured in a manner which minimised that risk. This action was taken in harmony with the competent authorities in the other member states of the European Union on the basis of Commission Directive 1999/82/EC, which related to clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of medicinal products.</P>
      <P>In view of the range of medicinal and other products that contain various substances derived from bovine origin the matter is by no means simple. The thrust of any action in this area is to minimise the risk of transmission of the infective agents rather than replacement of the materials used. This approach includes the sourcing of materials from countries with lower levels of BSE.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Naas General Hospital has encountered an increase in its workload in recent years and in this regard a major capital development is under way at the hospital. Phase two of the development of the hospital commenced on site in November 1999 and is programmed for completion in July 2002. Funding for the development is provided for under the national development plan. The total cost of phase two will be of the order of £45.5 million at current estimates. On completion of phase two, the hospital will have a total of 189 beds, including 25 day beds and 30 beds in the psychiatric unit provided under phase one. Phase two includes the following new accommodation:</P>

      <P>One of the key objectives set for the health services is to develop strategies and structures that will ensure an integrated service that maximises the contribution from each component area or speciality. This is being done by looking at where linkages can be made and examining particular sectors to see how their future development can be shaped to the greatest effect.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I am considering the review of general practice undertaken by the chief executive officers of the health boards. That review was concerned with the current organisation and operation of general practice and the barriers that exist to its future strategic development.</P>
      <P>When I have completed my consideration, it is my intention to seek the Government's approval to proceed on the basis of the recommendations in the review and to then engage in the fullest consultations with the relevant representative parties, in particular the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners, both of which have prepared their own joint vision statement. I envisage that process commencing in late spring.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Medical Manpower Forum was established in May 1998 to review the medical staffing in public hospitals. One of the key principles of the forum is to ensure that the highest quality of medical care is provided for those who require the services of hospitals. This will require an increase in the present number of hospital consultant posts and a number of other linked changes. I received the report of the forum following its final meeting on 28 November 2000. The report, among other things, sets out the key requirements for the structuring of consultant posts in the context of both changed work patterns and increases in the consultant work force. I will be submitting this report to Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>Both documents referred to above provide an opportunity to examine how best the respective services and service providers can be developed bearing in mind the need for an integrated and coherent approach to the planning, management and delivery of medical and other health services.</P>

      <P>On 2 May last, Deputy Molloy, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with special responsibility for housing, launched a Government strategy for the adult homeless, Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy. The strategy requires each health board to carry out an assessment of the needs of the homeless in its functional area.</P>
      <P>Each health board will examine its range of responses to the health and personal social service needs of homeless persons in consultation with the homeless forum in the area and draw up an action plan for meeting such needs. Officials in my Department are currently preparing comprehensive guidelines to assist the health boards in drawing up these action plans. It is also recognised in Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, that those leaving institutional care, be it custodial or health related, are one of the principal groups at risk of becoming homeless. My Department is also developing a strategy aimed at preventing homelessness among those at risk which will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Dublin area, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, has recently <Col N="404" /> appointed a director of homelessness who is working closely with the three area health boards in implementing the strategy Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy. This strategy calls for the further development of partnership working through participation and active involvement in the board of the new Homeless Agency that will oversee the implementation of an action plan to significantly impact and reduce the level of adult homelessness.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the work of the three area health boards will include:&ndash;</P>
    <P>the appointment of area co-ordinators who will be responsible for the implementation of the health and care aspects of the action plan;</P>
    <P>better take up of medical cards for those who are homeless;</P>
    <P>the establishment of two multi-disciplinary teams whose composition will include nurses, doctors, community welfare officers, social workers, care attendants, community psychiatric nurses and outreach drug workers who will connect with and support homeless people quickly and effectively and link them into mainstream services;</P>
    <P>training of staff in homeless services;</P>
    <P>the provision of a dedicated dental service for homeless people;</P>
    <P>improved discharge procedures for people who are homeless;</P>
    <P>improved mental health services for people who are homeless;</P>
    <P>improved access to addiction services for homeless people including those who have alcohol problems.</P>
    <P>The proposed action plan detailing the work in the above areas includes time scales for each of the main work areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to youth homelessness, the ERHA and the three area health boards in the eastern region have, over the last four months, been putting in place a wide range of preventive, emergency care and after care services for children and young people who are out-of-home. The objective is to ensure that where possible children and their families are supported to enable young people to remain at home and where this is not possible that easily accessible services are provided so that children are safe and supported and where appropriate returned home.</P>
    <P>To drive this process, the ERHA has appointed an assistant chief executive for child care and youth homelessness within its three area health boards. Very significant progress has been made regarding youth homelessness in the ERHA area, as follows: properties have been acquired to provide additional emergency, downstream and aftercare residential accommodation; outreach services are being expanded and restructured to ensure that vulnerable young people are made aware of the new facilities, encouraged to avail of them and that they do not fall through the net; the new residential accommodation will be managed in such a way that outreach workers are <Col N="405" /> clearly aware at all times of the centres in which the most appropriate accommodation is available; and there will be clear protocols for access to and management of beds.</P>
    <P>A wide range of preventative projects such as springboard, family resource centres and community projects will be expanded. A providers forum on youth homelessness has been established and is chaired by the recently appointed director of homelessness and is working with the authority on implementing the recommendations in the youth homelessness report. This forum has wide representations from service providers both across the voluntary and statutory sector who are involved in working with young people out of home. New developments for young people who are abusing drugs are also part of the package of measures taking place to improve and expand the services to young people who are homeless.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, is administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. However, it is the intention to increase the rates by 25% to £90, £120 and £150 from 1 April next.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22(3) and 22(4) of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. In 1985, my Department issued guidelines to health boards on the criteria applicable in assessing priority of need for specialist orthodontic treatment; the guidelines are based on the degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion which prioritises need for treatment.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on orthodontic services &ndash;&ldquo;The Moran Report&rdquo;&ndash; recommended that all health boards use the same severity index to determine need and that provision of orthodontic treatment should continue on the basis of priority need. There have been discussions between my Department and representatives of the health board chief executive officers on the report and its implications. Proposals in the report are being progressively implemented. Amendments to the 1985 guidelines are being finalised with the health board chief executive officers and the review group on orthodontic services.</P>

    <P>The waiting times for adult cataract procedures as at 30 September 2000, in the format collected by my Department, was 1,789 for those waiting for between three and 12 months and 734 for those waiting 12 months and over.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001 following the significant success experienced in this area last year. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that the overall numbers on waiting lists at the end of September 2000, the latest available figures, show a decrease of 7,198, which represents a reduction of 19.5% on the end of December 1999 quarter. This welcome reduction is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The waiting list initiative funding for 2001 has been made available to health agencies in conjunction with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative, the national bed capacity review and the winter initiative investment.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I was pleased to announce an investment package of £25 million to address a number of key service issues in the acute and non-acute sectors. The investment is being targeted at a number of areas, including the provision of additional step down facilities for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment. Many of these patients are older people and require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment. Under the winter initiative, at least 500 additional nursing home places will be contracted from private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this element of the initiative will increase the capacity of the acute hospital sector to address the problem of inappropriate use of hospital beds and will enhance the level of step down care available. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with leng<Col N="411" /> thy waiting lists and, more importantly, waiting times.</P>

      <P>I have made funding available to the Health Service Employers Agency to employ a nurse manager to co-ordinate the provision of supervised clinical placements for nurses recruited from abroad. Nurses from the Philippines and certain other non-EU countries are required to undertake such placements prior to registration with An Bord Altranais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recruitment of nurses from abroad is helping to ease staffing difficulties across a range of health care settings. However, some problems have arisen in relation to the availability of supervised clinical placements. I am determined that nurses requiring such placements will be provided with them. The Health Service Employers Agency co-ordinator will have a nationwide remit <Col N="413" /> in ensuring the availability of sufficient clinical placements.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to provide funding to teaching hospitals involved in the provision of supervised clinical placements in respect of the salary of a clinical co-ordinator for the duration of such placements. My Department is currently in discussion with the Dublin academic teaching hospitals in relation to their specific requirements in this regard, and it is also in contact with a number of major teaching hospitals outside Dublin. Since the salary of a clinical placement co-ordinator is the biggest single cost element, the availability of funding to cover it will greatly reduce the overall cost to agencies, such as nursing homes, which are recruiting nurses from non-EU countries.</P>
    <P>However, other costs associated with these placements, including vaccinations and meals, are a matter for negotiation between the individual hospital and prospective employer concerned. I am not in a position to provide funding on a retrospective basis to cover the salaries of clinical placement co-ordinators who have already undertaken work in relation to supervised placements for nurses recruited from abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials in my Department are currently working on two major pieces of adoption legislation, (1) the adoption information Bill, and (2) the Bill to ratify the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Legislation is at an advanced stage in the area of adoption information. Currently access to <Col N="416" /> birth information is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952, although tracing and reunion services are provided on a non-statutory basis by the Adoption Board, the health boards, registered adoption societies and some voluntary groups. This Bill will regulate on a statutory basis search and reunion services and will provide for information rights for adopted people, birth parents and other parties to the adoption. It is also proposed that this Bill will deal with access to records and the care and management of records held by the various agencies. I anticipate having the scheme of a Bill in this area to Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>(2) Ireland signed the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption in 1996 and work is also at an advanced stage on legislation to ratify the convention. This legislation will involve major and fundamental amendment of our inter-country adoption laws. The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation among countries in order to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interest of the children concerned. A child-centred approach incorporating structures and procedures which accord with good practice in inter-country adoption is being taken into account in the preparation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that this legislation will deal with the following areas:</P>
    <P>the establishment of a central authority under the convention &ndash; this authority will co-operate with central authorities in other countries and will be responsible for carrying out or overseeing the procedures for inter-country adoption under the convention. It is proposed that the Adoption Board will be designated as our central authority under the legislation;</P>
    <P>detailed provisions on the implementation of the Hague Convention including the establishment of an accreditation system for bodies proposing to provide adoption services for prospective adopters;</P>
    <P>some general provisions governing the regulation of inter-country adoption from both &ldquo;convention&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-convention&rdquo; countries including the preparation/assessment of applicants, the preservation of birth information on the child, the promotion of adoption counselling and post adoption services, the recognition of adoptions (not covered under current legislation) and restrictions on inter-country adoptions from &ldquo;non-convention&rdquo; countries.</P>
    <P>The issue of non-convention adoptions is not covered within the convention itself. While it is not the intention to exclude any countries with which we already have agreements or working arrangements in place which uphold the spirit and principles of the convention, events of the last week have emphasised the importance of greater regulation in this area. I anticipate hav<Col N="417" /> ing the scheme of a Bill in this area to Government shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 580, 698 and 736 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of medical services to eligible persons in counties Carlow and Kilkenny is the statutory responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that the patient referred to by Deputy McGuinness was admitted for emergency care on 5 December 2000, to the gynaecology ward. On the previous day, 4 December 2000, nine elective patients were admitted by the patient's consultant for surgery on 5 December 2000. At the time of admission of the patient, all beds in the gynaecology ward were full. The patient had to be maintained in a bed on the corridor and screens were provided around the bed to improve privacy. The South Eastern Health Board very much regrets that this patient had to be admitted to a bed on a corridor. I also understand that the board has reviewed its admission policy, and is seeking to retain one bed in the gynaecology ward for emergency admissions.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board document Shaping the Future of the Kilkenny Hospital System is the blueprint for the development of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, as a comprehensive, integrated, quality and efficient hospital, capable of meeting the challenges of the times in a competent and humane manner. The target date set for rationalisation of all hospital services in Kilkenny city into an interactive hospital complex is 2002.</P>
      <P>This development plan contains proposals to enhance existing services on the St. Luke's site including general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics, gynaecology, accident and emergency and diagnostic services. It proposes to provide all hospital services on one site in a way that combines ease of access to the public with a cost effective service. The development plans take account of national policy which is to have a strong network of local and general hospitals which serve defined catchment hospital services for general medical and surgical facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. This review is in line with the commitment contained in the &ldquo;Programme for Prosperity and Fairness&rdquo;. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department <Col N="419" /> of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues last year and identified a range of short to medium-term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. A more detailed assessment of need is now being undertaken to inform decisions on a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and I expect this phase of the review to be completed in spring 2001.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the situation where on 30 November 2000 the total number of beds out of use in acute hospitals was 315, representing 2.6% of the designated beds in the public acute hospital system.</Quest>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to a Priority Question on 7 December 2000, the total number of beds out of use on 30 November 2000 in acute hospitals was 315. This represented 2.6% of the total number of designated beds in the public acute hospital system (12,327). The following tabular statement details the number of beds out of use at that time. In summary, of the 315 beds out of use: 9% were closed because of bacterial infection; 58% were closed due to ward refurbishment and 33 % were closed due to nursing shortages.</P>
      <P>The 9% of beds which were closed due to bacterial infection were those in the haematology/oncology unit (Burkitt Ward) in St. James's Hospital. It is expected that this unit will reopen in March. Some 183 beds were closed due to ward refurbishment. While ward closures are inconvenient, they reflect the unprecedented level of investment now taking place in acute hospital facilities under the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to nursing shortages, I have recently announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and <Col N="420" /> midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service, and addressing shortages in specialist areas, including accident and emergency. The initiative includes:</P>
    <P>A new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service which will come into operation on 1 February next. The abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-nursing&rdquo; courses with immediate effect. In addition, nurses and midwives undertaking such courses will, for the first time ever, be paid a salary. The intention behind this initiative is to remove all financial obstacles in the path of nurses and midwives who wish to return to practice.</P>
    <P>From the current academic year, all nurses studying for the post-registration Higher Diploma in Sick Children's Nursing will have their fees refunded. They will also receive an enhanced salary while in training.</P>
    <P>The number of available places on specialist nursing courses is being expanded. In order to encourage more nurses into specialised areas of clinical practice, nurses undertaking specific courses will now receive full pay while doing so. They will also have their course fees paid in return for a commitment to continue working in the specialist area for a specified period following completion of the course.</P>
    <P>Funding is being provided to the HSEA to employ a nurse manager to co-ordinate the provision of supervised clinical placements for nurses recruited from abroad.</P>
    <P>A major advertising campaign aimed at attracting qualified nurses and midwives back to work is under way. This campaign is making use of radio and print media advertising to market nursing as a career with the specific objective of encouraging nurses and midwives back into the system.</P>
    <P>In addition, hospitals have been seeking to recruit nurses from abroad. At end of December 2000, 531 working visas and 26 work authorisations had been granted to nurses. Staffing difficulties currently being encountered will ease as these nurses commence employment.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to make arrangements with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to keep the need for bed closures under continuous review.</P>

      <P>Arising out of an initiative taken by the French Presidency of the European Union, a resolution was adopted by the Council of Ministers (Health) at its meeting on 14 December 2000, on paediatric medicinal products. This resolution invited the Commission &ldquo;to make appropriate proposals as soon as possible in the form of incentives, regulatory or other supporting measures in respect of clinical research and development, taking account of the ethical aspects of clinical trials on children, to ensure that new medicinal products for children and medicinal products already on the market are fully adapted to the specific needs of that population group.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo;, the cardiovascular health strategy report, contains 211 recommendations aimed at reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease in Ireland over the coming years. The report is being implemented in a planned and structured manner. The purpose of screening of school-going children or of adolescents would be to detect individuals with familial hypercholesterolamia, the major genetically-determined cause of raised cholesterol. When <Col N="422" /> detected, the National Centre for Inherited Metabolic Diseases in Temple Street Children's Hospital provides specialist treatment services. At present, familial hypdercholesterolaemia is detected opportunistically when adults present for health screening or with symptoms. The advisory forum on cardiovascular health will consider the issue of screening of children and young people for this condition in the context of developing approaches to the assessment of high risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population.</P>

      <P>On 12 December, I met the chairman, chief executive officer and national medical director of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, for a briefing on emerging strategies to further minimise the possible risk of transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion. Before this meeting the chairman spoke to me and advised me that at its meeting on 8 November 2000, the board of the IBTS decided to commission an independent investigation in relation to the person referred to by the Deputy. I was informed that the proposed investigation relates to allegations of ongoing undermining of the position of the chairman, the board, the chief executive officer and the national medical director of such seriousness as to threaten the proper conduct of the IBTS's business, failure to observe normal employment protocol in observing appropriate reporting relationships and breach of expressed and implied terms of contract. The chairman told me that the person concerned had declined to participate in the above process and that she proposed to raise this matter at the board meeting scheduled for 13 December. I have no further information in relation to the current position on this matter. As this is an internal human resource issue which is the responsibility of the IBTS, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IBTS operates in a fast moving and challenging area of the health system in which there is a full and demanding role for the board, man<Col N="423" /> agement and the entire staff of the organisations at all locations. There is a responsibility on all concerned to resolve the difficulties which exist between the Cork centre of the IBTS and its national headquarters to ensure a truly national service and to progress with its core business of developing best transfusion practice for the future. I might add that recent public disagreements between the IBTS and the Southern Health Board are not conducive to the effective co-operation and partnership between complementary organisations which is to be expected and which prevails generally in the health system. This is all the more regrettable at the present time when the energies of the IBTS and hospitals generally should be focused on developing best transfusion practice including important strategies to address the possible risk of the transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588, 589, 591 and 593 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of drugs and medicines (ex manufacture) in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association &ndash; IPHA (formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries &ndash; FICI) which provides that the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, <Col N="424" /> whichever is the lower. Accordingly, Irish prices for the ingredient cost of prescription medicines are generally in line with prices in the UK. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products.</P>
    <P>Some considerable discrepancies can exist between the prices of individual products both within Ireland and between Ireland and the UK, particularly if the comparison is made on the basis of generic equivalents. There is also a vibrant generic market in the UK where the overall market is much larger and where there is significant competition that affects prices charged for generic medicines. Ranitidine, a generic version of Zantac, which I assume is the drug referred to by the Deputy, is marketed under a number of different names in Ireland, most of which are reimbursable under both the general medical services and drug payment schemes. The price difference between the top of the range and the bottom is significant. I am not aware of price differences, where Ranitidine is concerned, between this country and the United Kingdom of the nature suggested, which is a factor of six.</P>
    <P>Under the GMS scheme, pharmacists are reimbursed the trade price, i.e. the ingredient cost of the drug dispensed by them, plus an appropriate dispensing fee. In the case of private prescriptions of medicines reimbursed under the drug payment scheme, the cost reimbursed by the State to pharmacists covers the ingredient cost of the medicine, the retail mark-up on the ingredient cost (normally 50% of the trade price) and a standard dispensing fee. My Department has no function in relation to the retail mark-up on private dispensing, which has been established by custom and practice over the years.</P>

      <P>The Dental Council is largely independent in the exercise of its functions under the Dentists Act, 1985. There are powers available to me under section 55 of the Act to direct the Dental Council to produce a scheme for a particular class of auxiliary dental worker but the content of such a Scheme is primarily a matter for the Dental Council. While such schemes are subject to my consent, I do not have powers of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of regulating the practice of denturism has been the subject of protracted correspondence between my Department and the Dental Council. In 1993, at the instigation of my Department, the Dental Council submitted a draft scheme for a class of auxiliary dental worker, to be known as clinical dental technician. However, this draft <Col N="425" /> scheme did not adequately address the existing situation of technicians engaged in the practice of denturism for a number of years who would have acquired a level of competence in the appropriate clinical and other skills required. With this in mind, my Department asked the Dental Council to examine the issue further.</P>
    <P>A new Dental Council was appointed in November 2000. I understand that its auxiliary dental workers committee has already set up a small group to examine this issue to enable the council reply to my Department at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>My Department's immunisation policy is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children under the age of two years against a number of serious infectious diseases. The present arrangements were introduced in 1995 and involve general practitioners entering into a contract with their local health board for the delivery of the programme. Parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the doctor of their choice.</P>
      <P>Operational responsibility for the primary childhood immunisation programme lies with the individual health boards, which have appropriate regional and local management structures in place. My Department also monitors the operation of the programme nationally and, as necessary, communicates with the health boards about issues which may arise from time to time.</P>
      <P>At my request, the chief executive officers of the health boards are in the process of establishing a national immunisation steering committee which will address a range of issues relating to the primary childhood immunisation programme as a whole. This will include consideration of the protocols for administration of vaccines, whether new mechanisms need to be developed to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date and to ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice. This committee will also address the question of setting up a coalition on immunisation as outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of anti-smoking initiatives. The current anti-smoking campaign &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual. This campaign was developed in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards.</P>
      <P>A further element of this campaign was developed last year to target female teenagers. The simple message of this element of the campaign is that smokers are less attractive and it uses a range of anti cosmetics presented by a character called NICO who highlights the unappealing aspects of smoking. The recent burst of the &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; campaign, including NICO, ran in January, and used all the appropriate mediums of communications to reach the target audiences such as television, radio, print, outdoor advertising as well as in-school advertising.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit has also supported a number of school programmes which seek to prevent young people taking up smoking in the first instance. The smoking reduction action programme is a peer led anti-smoking programme for schools which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, the National Youth Federation and with support from the Department of Education and Science. The smokebusters project, which is aimed at primary school children (seven-11 years) in an urban environment, was developed by the Irish Cancer Society, Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the then Eastern Health Board. Other projects include smoke free Leitrim, smoke free Carlow and health kicks.</P>
      <P>The Change of Heart Handbook which has been delivered to every home in the country in the autumn last year as part of the &ldquo;Ireland needs a Change of Heart&rdquo; campaign also offers encouragement and support to those wanting to quit smoking. Action against smoking also continues at health board level and in the voluntary sector. The health promotion unit, in association with voluntary agencies active in this area, continues to produce a range of materials including leaflets and posters containing information on smoking and information which encourage smokers to quit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EU level, I have affirmed Ireland's ongoing commitment to supporting Commission anti-tobacco initiatives and in particular, initiatives which will protect children from the commercial exploitation by the tobacco industry. Ireland has, for many years, been a leading advocate for the worldwide control and ultimate elimination of <Col N="428" /> tobacco use from our society. Ireland was one of the first countries to introduce restrictions on tobacco advertising and sponsorship by the industry, to recognise the impact of environmental tobacco smoke and to introduce prohibitions on smoking in public places.</P>

The strategy outlines the changes proposed over the next five years to address the requirements for health research. As it is currently being considered by my Department it would not be appropriate at this stage to set out steps which will be taken to implement the strategy. However, I do intend to publish, as soon as possible, a report on a strategy for research within the health system.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting the 55% increase in my Department's contribution to the revenue budget of the Health Research Board in 2001. This will bring the board's budget to £10.571 million, which is an increase of 275% since 1997.</P>

      <P>I have received the report of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, &ldquo;The Costs of Caring for People with Dementia and Related Cognitive Impairments&rdquo;, the contents of which I am having examined in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken in relation to the improvement of dementia services. Significant additional funding (£4 million) has been made available in the period 1999-2001 for the express purpose of providing assistance to carers. Additional funding of £1.7 million has been made available to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland for expansion of their services, particularly day-care. A number of new community nursing units for older people, which have been constructed in recent years, provide respite and day-care for people with dementia. A further 30 such units are expected to be put in place during the lifetime of the national development plan. In addition, purpose-built units for the care of older people who are mentally infirm will be con<Col N="429" /> structed in a number of locations such as Galway, Newcastlewest and Carndonagh, under the national development plan. Resources have also been provided to expand the provision of specialist services in psychiatry of old age. It is planned that by the end of 2001 some 14 consultant-led services will be in place.</P>
    <P>I accept the need to further develop services for people with dementia and their carers, as outlined in the council's report, particularly in relation to meeting the preferences of older people to be supported in their own homes. It is my intention to continue with initiatives commenced in recent years of allocating additional developmental resources towards the build-up of community supports for older people, including those with dementia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to clarify this matter for the Deputy. In October 2000, I announced a £25 million investment package to help alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter period. The investment package is being targeted at a number of areas, including the contracting of private nursing home beds, the provision of aids and supports for use by older people and the recruitment of over 40 additional consultants to the hospital system.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these initiatives are being implemented by the various health agencies involved. For example, I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards that over 450 private nursing home beds have been contracted to date in response to demand.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recruitment of additional consultants I requested of Comhairle na nOspidéal that these posts be filled initially on a temporary basis, given the long lead-in time normally associated with the recruitment of consultants. This matter was considered by Comhairle na nOspidéal, as the body with statutory responsibility in this area. My Department was advised by Comhairle na nOspidéal on 18 December 2000 that it had approved the appointment of 29 additional temporary accident and emergency consultants. These posts have since been advertised in the national press and the recruitment process is now under way. The Department was further advised on 19 December 2000 by Comhairle na nOspidéal that it had approved, initially on a temporary basis, up to 15 consultant anaesthetists.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he is proposing to take to deal with a situation, as set out by the Chief Medical Officer in his Department recently, that there is evidence that the less well off in society have poorer access to health services.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>International research has found that there are large differentials in mortality and morbidity between the higher and lower socio-economic groups and the conclusions from this research are that health inequalities are primarily a consequence of material differences in living standards.</P>
      <P>The main principles underlying the 1994 Health Strategy are equity, quality of service and accountability. The strategy sets a framework for reorienting the health services to achieve health and social gain with a particular emphasis on improving the situation of people in the lower socio-economic groups. It states that the pursuit of equity must extend beyond the question of access to services and must also be concerned with variations in health status between groups.</P>
      <P>In 1998, my Department commissioned the first nationally representative survey of lifestyle practices &ndash;  the national health and lifestyle surveys &ndash; to provide baseline data to plan future interventions. This research reached similar conclusions as the health strategy. The data forms the basis of my Department's New Health Promotion Strategy for the years 2000 to 2005. This has specific strategic aims and objectives that will contribute to reducing health inequalities.</P>
      <P>Many of the causal factors of health inequalities, such as poverty and unemployment, are outside the direct control of the health services. Inter-sectoral collaboration is required to tackle these problems. The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, chaired by the Taoiseach, includes Ministers from eight relevant Departments who meet regularly. Also, the NAPS inter-departmental group provides the principal strategic focus for the National Anti-Poverty Strategy. This strategy was published in 1997 and set out a programme to reduce poverty and social exclusion both in general and in a number of key policy areas. Substantial progress has been made in achieving the original targets. Although health or health targets were not included in the original NAPS targets, my Department has been involved in setting and reviewing annual work plans for NAPS. In addition, in the context of the new partnership agreement &ldquo;Programme for Prosperity and Fairness&rdquo;, my Department will take part in a group to consider the setting of health targets to be included in the next phase of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to review the underlying methodology and existing targets of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and where appropriate, to <Col N="431" /> consider in consultation with the social partners possible new targets such as health. A working group on NAPS and health has been established. The group has met twice and it is expected to produce a final report by summer 2001.</P>
    <P>The National Cancer Strategy set a target of reducing the proportion of deaths from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15%. Since the launch of the strategy, about £60 million has been invested in a range of service developments under the strategy, to the benefit of all, including in particular those socio-economic groups at a greater relative risk of contracting cancer due to environmental or lifestyle factors.</P>
    <P>The recently launched cardiovascular health strategy had noted that the lower socio-economic groups seem to suffer disproportionately from heart disease. In this context two targets have been set for 2010. The medium term objective is to bring Irish levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. The longer term goal is to reduce Irish rates to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>
    <P>The waiting list initiative is aimed at ensuring that no adult has to wait longer than 12 months and no child longer that six months for access to an acute public hospital procedure. The achievement of these targets, which is being pursued through the implementation of a comprehensive set of short, medium and longer term measures, would represent an important improvement in access to care for those in the lower socio-economic groups, and others relying on public hospital services.</P>
    <P>The overall budget for health services for 2001 is now over £5 billion. This represents a 48% increase over the past two years and is a clear recognition of the Government's commitment to provide a high quality health service directed at those most in need.</P>
    <P>The £2 billion earmarked in the NDP for health capital for the seven year period 2000-06 represents almost a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. This investment will provide a physical infrastructure to underpin a public health service characterised by ongoing improvements in quality and accessibility and will be a significant ingredient in improving the mortality and morbidity of the poorest groups in our society.</P>
    <P>The ability of a society to create and maintain an environment which supports its people in attaining the highest level of health compatible with their natural endowment is one of the key indicators of the stage of development of a society and is recognised as such by its inclusion in the UN's list of human development indicators. Much work has already been done in Ireland on a multi-sectoral approach to poverty and social inclusion. It is essential that we continue to build and improve on the framework in place in the context of revised NAPS targets, NDP funding, and the commitments contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 606 and 607 together.</P>
      <P>All clinical trials conducted in this country are subject to strict regulatory controls under the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990. In view of this legislative control and the extensive guidelines, both national and international, that are already in operation and in use in this country in regard to the conduct of clinical trials, it is not considered that any further guidelines are necessary at this time.</P>
      <P>On the coming into force of the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, the Department of Health published guidelines on the implementation of the Act, to assist and inform all persons that may be involved in clinical trials, whether as sponsors, investigators, members of ethics committees or as participants. These guidelines were further updated in 1990 when the Act was amended. These guidelines, <i>inter alia, </i>summarised the requirements of the Acts and of the safeguards provided in respect of participants, including participants who are not capable of understanding the significance of the informed consent as required under section 9 of the Act.</P>
      <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board, now the Irish Medicines Board, also published detailed guidelines, titled &ldquo;Guidelines for applications for clinical trial investigations of medicinal products for human use&rdquo;. While these guidelines were directed mainly at applicants, they also dealt with problem areas for obtaining informed consent, as in the case of children and persons with mental functional abnormality including psychiatric disorders and mental deficiency. All of these guidelines continue to be in operation today via the Irish Medicines Board under the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990.</P>
      <P>Since the coming into force of the 1987 Act, no clinical trial may be conducted unless the person who proposes to conduct the trial holds a permission under the Act. Currently application for permission must be made to the Irish Medicines Board. All proposals to carry out trials are evaluated by the board in consultation with an expert sub-committee on clinical trials which then makes its recommendation to the board and to the Advisory Committee on Human Medicines. On receipt of the recommendation from the clinical trial sub-committee, the board grants the required permission under the Acts. All trials are required to be conducted according to internationally recognised standards of good clinical practice, in particular those adopted within the International Conference on Harmonisation, including the EU Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In parallel to the permission granted by the Irish Medicines Board, it is also necessary under Section 8 of the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987, for the approval of the relevant Ethics Committees to be obtained. The composition of these Ethics Committees is approved by the Irish Medicines Board when it grants the required per<Col N="434" /> mission. The matters which must be taken into account by these committees are set out in detail in Section 8(4) of the 1987 Act. These matters include the recruitment of participants, financial inducements, selection of volunteers and informed consent.</P>
    <P>The need for trials to be conducted in accordance with internationally required standards of good clinical practice (GCP) is a matter which must also be taken into account by the Ethics Committees in their deliberations. Compliance with standards of good clinical practice provides a public assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. These also provide assurance that the clinical data provided by these trials is credible.</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Bill currently before the Oireachtas will prohibit the conduct of clinical trials on patients who are held involuntarily for psychiatric care and treatment.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of the report &ldquo;Irish Psychiatric Services &ndash; Activities 1999&rdquo; which was published by the Health Research Board. One of the report's findings was that there were differences in admission rates to psychiatric hospitals reflecting variations in practice and in the availability and usage of beds. Significant progress has been made since 1984 in transforming the mental health services, moving away from a hospital-based model to one based in the community. However, the pace of change has varied in different parts of the country and this is reflected in the differences in admission rates.</P>
      <P>Approximately £150 million capital will be provided for the development of Mental Health Services over the lifetime of the national development plan to accelerate the development of community based services. This funding will go towards the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals; new mental health centres; day hospitals and other day facilities; and additional community-based residential accommodation.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £18.6 million was allocated to the mental health services for the current year, most of which will be to provide additional medical, paramedical and nursing support staff and to facilitate improvements in psychology and social work services.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, as amended by the Nursing Home Subvention) (Amendment Regulations, 1993, 1996 and 1998. These regulations set out the general rules which should be applied by health boards in the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. The purpose of the subvention regulations is to provide a framework for the support of people in need of nursing home care and without the means to pay for it.</P>
      <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. Included in this review will be an examination of the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the operation of the scheme. The findings of this review, which is expected to be completed shortly, will be examined in my Department for the purposes of determining what action requires to be taken in relation to the future operation of this scheme.</P>

    <P>My Department has also been directly active, through the national general practice information technology group, in developing a website specifically for general practitioners on matters of interest to them, including IT training and news.

    <P>More web based developments are planned for this year to make information communications technology more relevant to general practitioners in terms of their daily work. Ultimately, the success or otherwise of these initiatives also depends on the willingness of general practitioners to avail of and use the appropriate technologies when provided.</P>

      <P>The system of postgraduate medical training in Ireland is changing broadly in line with changes in the UK. Comhairle na nOspidéal has now approved approximately 600 senior-specialist registrar posts. There has been a noticeable expansion in higher specialist trainee numbers in recent years. Most specialties &ndash; other than pathology and other medical specialties &ndash; now have formed schemes of higher specialist training with senior/specialist registrar posts. Approximately 400 such posts are in place and it is expected that further developments across other specialties will lead to the conversion of more NCHD posts to senior-specialist registrar posts. The current level of NCHD vacancies in public hospitals is less than 1%.</P>

The current fees, including a fee, £12, for a general search, that is a search of the index for a period not exceeding six successive hours, without stating the object of the search. The fee for a <Col N="438" /> particular search, that is, a search not exceeding five years for a particular entry is £1.50. The fee for a certified copy of an entry in the register (certificate), excluding the search fee, is £4. Certificates are required for certain legal purposes and to support applications for certain State services. However, to facilitate people involved in family research in the General Register Office provides photocopies of entries for a fee of £1.50.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, a major action plan was announced to implement the proposals contained in the National Cancer <Col N="439" /> Strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I of the programme has commenced and is covering the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and is targeting 140,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country and will be implemented as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles Unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion Unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. Screening commenced in both units in March 2000. The Deputy will appreciate that the nature, scope and extent of the national breast screening programme has determined that it can only proceed on a gradual basis. Screening, therefore, takes place on an area by area basis and is done by district electoral divisions. As it is anticipated that phase I of the programme will take a minimum of two years to complete, it is understandable and inevitable that some women will become ineligible to participate in the programme due to the time span involved.</P>
      <P>It was determined from the outset that this programme should initially be limited to women in the 50-64 age group, but it is anticipated that, when the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service can be delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and continuing the screening of women already in the programme who have reached 65 years of age. Screening by mammography under the age of 50 remains unproven in terms of reduction in mortality.</P>

      <P>The provision of housing modification grants for people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and they are provided through the relevant local authority. Health boards are involved with these grants to the extent that an assessment of the individual case must be carried out by an occupational therapist from the health board, in order for the grant to be approved. Accordingly, the Deputy's question <Col N="440" /> has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are staff shortages in the therapy grades in the health service. In order to address these shortages my Department has engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a work force planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including occupational therapists. This report is expected within the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on various health professionals made recommendations in relation to an enhanced career structure for occupational therapists. This has resulted in a large number of occupational therapists being upgraded. It has also led to the creation of a clinical specialist post for the therapy grades. The creation of this grade will allow for career progression for those who do not want to move into management. It will also ensure that clinical expertise is not lost to the professions.</P>

    <P>The interim report gives details of the four meetings of the forum which were held from September 2000 &ndash; December 2000 inclusive. It highlights the forum's desire to maximise engagement with the views of members of the public and interested bodies; to this end, advertisements were placed in the national newspapers at the end of November 2000 inviting submissions from the public on the issues under discussion and it is hoped to run a series of radio advertisements to this effect shortly. It also stresses the forum's efforts to achieve balanced debate on the issues under discussion: two internationally renowned anti-fluoridation speakers gave presentations to the forum at a meeting which was held in October 2000 and further speakers have been invited. At the request of the forum, I recently appointed a member of the Irish Doctors' Environmental <Col N="441" /> Association as a representative of those with anti-fluoridation concerns.</P>

      <P>I have long recognised that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran Report &ndash; review of Orthodontic Services &ndash; structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services to allow the targets set out in the Dental Health Action Plan to be achieved. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists.</P>
      <P>An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This initiative will enable health boards to recruit additional staff to provide orthodontic treatment; provide additional sessions for existing staff; and make additional arrangements for the provision of treatment by private orthodontists at approved rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards will also validate existing waiting lists. As part of the Initiative, the Department approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional <Col N="443" /> Health Authority for a grant in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of tax credits on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders.</P>
    <P>The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The group has set a target date of 1 April this year for the implementation of the pilot scheme.</P>

    <P>Meningococcal C immunisation programme commenced in October 2000. Phase 1 of the programme is targeting children under five years and young persons aged 15-18 years. While it is as yet too early to establish the precise level of uptake being achieved in relation to the Meningococcal C vaccine, preliminary indications are that uptake is generally good. Uptake in the third level population is not satisfactory, however, and new initiatives to target this group are being developed.</P>
    <P>Primary immunisation uptake still falls short of the target. Special efforts are being made with the health boards to achieve the national target of 95%. The health boards are in the process of establishing a special group to develop strategies to address the problems on a national basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to MMR immunisation, the health boards intensified their MMR immunisation programmes following the measles outbreak &ndash; more than 1,500 cases &ndash; which occurred in 2000. Among the efforts made in this regard were: the identification and follow-up of children who have not been immunised; the targeting of black spots and vulnerable groups; requesting general practitioners to make special efforts to promote this vaccine to parents; contacting parents, schools and pre-schools to emphasise the importance of this vaccination; national and local media awareness campaigns on MMR vaccination.</P>
    <P>There is some public concern about the MMR vaccine and this is felt to be a significant factor in the unsatisfactory uptake. All of the expert advice available indicates that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective and that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and either chronic inflammatory bowel disease or autism. This is supported by a number of well-validated studies on this issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge parents to immunise their children, which is free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

      <P>The Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, which give effect to EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC, require that all medicinal products (including vaccines) placed on the <Col N="445" /> market in this country must be the subject of product authorisations granted by the Irish Medicines Board. Before the board will grant an authorisation, it must be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned.</P>
      <P>Suspected adverse reactions to medicinal products, including vaccines used in vaccination programmes, are reported on an ongoing basis by medical practitioners and other health-care professions, that is, doctors, nurses etc. to the Irish Medicines Board. Where suspected adverse reactions come to the notice of the pharmaceutical companies concerned they are also obliged to report the matter to the board. All adverse reaction reports received by the board are examined by its pharmacovigilance unit on an ongoing basis and if any concerns are identified, appropriate action is taken.</P>
      <P>The procedures and requirements for the control of vaccines, as medicinal products, in this country are in conformity with the current procedures and requirements that are in place for such products in other EU Member States. These procedures, in addition to the ongoing review of adverse reaction reports, require the renewal of the relevant product authorisations every five years when the advances in scientific knowledge and other new information that may have become available, are taken into account in the course of the renewal process.</P>
      <P>I am therefore satisfied that those procedures in place to ensure the safety of vaccine products are satisfactory at the present time.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware that emerging technologies in the area of e-government and e-health have great potential to improve the maintenance of health and the delivery of health care in Ireland. I am supporting a number of projects in the health service which are already proving the usefulness of these new technologies.</P>
      <P>I am currently working on the development of a new health strategy and I plan to launch this in mid 2001. It is fortuitous that I am developing the health strategy at a time when I can include plans to harness the full potential of e-government and e-health to best benefit the health and well-being of the population. In the meantime, my Department is working on the development of an interim e-health strategy. This interim strategy will concentrate on two issues: appropriate infrastructures to enable a range of future developments to take place and on making a range of health service related information available to the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> Under the national development plan the total estimate for ICT for the health service is £20 million in 2001 and part of this will be used for initiatives in the e-government area. Also, I am currently in the process of finalising an allocation from the information society fund to be used specifically for developments in this area.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a number of e-government initiatives within my own Department. In common with other Government Departments, my Department makes extensive use of e-mail facilities and we manage the processing of parliamentary questions electronically. Currently, four websites provide information for the Department itself, the Adoption Board, the Irish Social Services Inspectorate and the General Register Office. My Department is working on a new health promotion website and a number of other websites are at the planning stage. In addition, my Department's work programme includes the development of a full internal ICT strategy which will necessarily include an overall strategy for e-government.</P>
    <P>My Department is also working jointly with the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs on the modernisation of the General Register Office (GRO). The modernised GRO will provide electronic registration facilities for vital events as well as electronic access to the registers of births, marriages and deaths. Separate funding for this project has been made available in the estimate for the office of the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>My Department engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a work force planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including speech and language therapists. Among the matters that this report will address is the number <Col N="447" /> of additional training places required by these professions. This report is expected within the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>In the interim, progress has been made in increasing the number of training places for speech and language therapists and an additional eight places have been made available by the colleges for the October 2000 intake of students.</P>
      <P>I am committed to taking all appropriate steps to promote the recruitment and retention of health services staff, including speech and language therapists. When the work force planning study is to hand, I will be considering all possible options to encourage qualified speech and language therapists to work in the Irish system, including those working abroad.</P>

      <P>In recent years, as part of the overall planning and development of services for persons with autism, the health boards and the ERHA have been obtaining additional information on the needs of this group in their regions, and in particular in relation to those who require or will require specialist services. The Department is also examining a number of measures, including the enhancement of existing information in relation to numbers and the health related support services required by them. At a meeting held earlier this month with representatives of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, an initial discussion took place regarding the development of a regional information system which would provide information on current service provision and current and future <Col N="449" /> needs of persons with autism. This matter will be followed up with the boards and ERHA over the coming months.</P>
      <P>With reference to the level of co-ordination which exists between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, both Departments, together with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, have worked together to enhance the level of educational and health related support services available to children with special needs. In relation to children with autism, additional funding of approximately £5 million has been invested by my Department between 1998 and 2000 to expand the level of health related support services to this group. A further £3 million has been made available by my Department in 2001, with a full year cost of £3.5 million in 2002, to further enhance these services for children with autism and those with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>My Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority will continue to work with the Department of Education and Science in relation to both the planning and enhancement of the overall level of educational and health related support services available to children with special needs, including those with autism.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the foster care system which currently exists in relation to psychiatric out-patients in County Roscommon. The clients of this system are not boarded out patients as defined in sections 209, 210 and 211 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, as amended.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to provide additional funding for this scheme or for its extension to other areas of the country. My Department has agreed with the management of the Western Health Board that this foster care service will be phased out over the coming years, to be replaced by more appropriate arrangements. This will involve the putting in place of a range of hostels to be supervised by qualified psychiatric nursing staff and complemented by day care support and rehabilitation-vocational training. Officials from my Department will be meeting with the health board shortly to discuss these developments further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 653, 673 and 677 together.</P>
      <P>The oral polio vaccine (opv) to which the Deputy refers was manufactured by Evans/Medeva in the UK and distributed for use in Ireland during the period 15 January 1998 to 30 January 1999. Seven batches of the vaccine consisting of 95,890 units were available for use over this period.</P>
      <P>On 13 December 2000 the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, informed my Department that a constituent of the vaccine namely human serum albumin (HSA) utilised a blood donation in its manufacture from a UK resident who has recently been diagnosed as having the variant form of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease, vCJD.</P>
      <P>HSA is a product which is made from human blood donations. It is a protein, albumin, obtained from blood serum, hence its name. It is used as a stabiliser in some medicinal products and vaccines. On receipt of the information, relating to this vaccine, from the IMB, I arranged to obtain expert advice from both national and international experts in the field who advised on a wide range of aspects relating to this issue. Their advice indicated that the potential risk, if any, to recipients is essentially non-existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This expert advice is based on a number of factors: the dilution factor involved in this case &ndash; the persons donation was one of 22,353 used to make a pool. This in turn was combined with another pool to give a final dilution of 1/63,866; the manufacturing process by which albumin, the agent used to stabilise the vaccine, is made from plasma involves a number of stages in the course <Col N="454" /> of which any potential for infection would be removed  &ndash; in other words, no infection possibility has been associated with albumin and the fact that polio vaccine is administered orally rather than by injection further reduces the theoretical possibility of transmission.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the plasma donation involved in this incident was donated in 1996-97 and the individual concerned has only recently been diagnosed as having contracted the disease. It would not therefore have been possible at the time of this person's donation to &ldquo;screen it out&rdquo; on the basis that he/she might later develop CJD. While blood donations are screened for communicable diseases, there are no tests which would enable donations to be screened for CJD or vCJD or which would allow doctors to establish whether any individual is at risk of contracting these diseases.</P>
    <P>My Department supplied background information, expert risk assessment and other data to health boards and to the Irish College of General Practitioners so that this could be circulated by them to health professionals and others. The Irish Medical Organisation was contacted on 15 December 2000 and informed on a confidential basis about the issues and that a public announcement would be made the following week.</P>
    <P>Each health board was asked to establish a telephone line which parents could call if they wished to discuss any concerns about their child/children arising from their having received the vaccine in question. It also enabled reassurance about the level of risk involved to be given to parents.</P>
    <P>There was a high volume of calls to these lines in the days immediately following the announcement and therefore not all callers were able to get through immediately. Where details of the vaccine batch administered were not immediately available to the health board the parent was advised to contact their GP. Additional information was available on my Department's website and on the web sites of the individual health boards and on that of the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>I and my Department greatly appreciate the efforts made by GPs in informing and reassuring parents following my public announcement. There was little opportunity for doctors to be briefed in advance of my announcement but this was inevitable given the urgency of making the information available in an organised and objective manner at the earliest possible opportunity. The proximity to Christmas was an added complication.</P>
    <P>Following the examination of vaccination records by general practitioners and health boards information has come to light which indicates that vaccine from the batches referred to above was administered after its expiry date.</P>
    <P>At my Department's request, the health boards are currently conducting an examination of records in order to establish the extent to which the vaccine in question was used beyond its expiry date. I requested expert advice in relation <Col N="455" /> to this issue from the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland who have advised that the efficacy of the vaccine reduces if it is administered more than one month after the expiry date and that the vaccination should therefore be repeated in such cases.</P>
    <P>I have met the Irish Medicines Board on 17 January 2001 to discuss a range of issues relating to the circumstances surrounding their announcement of 13 December 2000. In addition the chief executive officers of the health boards are currently establishing a National Immunisation Steering Committee which will address a range of issues relating to the primary childhood immunisation programme. This will include consideration of the protocols for administration of vaccines, whether new mechanisms need to be developed to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date and to ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice.</P>
    <P>My office has no record of a formal request for a meeting from the IMO. However, officials of my Department are available to discuss the issues with the IMO if it so wishes.</P>

      <P>Article 31(1) of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, provides that an annual fee towards the cost of inspections under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, shall be paid by the pre-school provider to the local health board. The amount of the fee as set out in the regulations is as follows: (a) where the service provided does not exceed 3.5 hours in the day &ndash; £25, and (b) in all other cases &ndash; £50. The regulations also provide that a health board may exempt from a fee a person carrying on a pre-school service in which no pre-school child is maintained for profit.</P>
      <P>Based on the most up to date information available from the health boards the fees collected by the health boards in 1999 together with the number of facilities exempt from fees are as follows:</P>

    <P>* Information from the Eastern Regional Health Authority is not yet to hand. It will be forwarded to the Deputy when available. Health boards have indicated that fees collected assist with the cost of: administration of pre-school inspections; an advisory service for pre-school providers; in-service training for service providers; good practice guidelines and information packs which are made available to pre-school providers and supports to community and voluntary play groups.</P>
    <P>A review of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, due to commence this year will provide an opportunity to examine the operation of the various requirements of the regulations, including annual fees.</P>

      <P>Flunitrazepam, which is the active ingredient in Rohypnol, has been classified as a Schedule 3 controlled drug in this country since 1993. The drug was reclassified in 1993 in response to reports of misuse and its rescheduling makes unauthorised possession an offence. The regulations also require that doctors prescribing Rohypnol abide by the special prescription writing requirements and Rohypnol should be stored in a controlled drugs cabinet in accordance with the Safe Custody Regulations, 1982. Under the terms of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, I may issue a special direction prohibiting prescribing by practitioners or pharmacists convicted of offences under these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> It is a matter for each practitioner to determine the appropriate treatment of a patient and where Rohypnol is indicated in treatment a practitioner will decide on the quantities for that patient. However, the product authorisation issued by the Irish Medicines Board for Rohypnol states that treatment with Rohypnol should be as short as possible, depending on the indication, but should not exceed four weeks for insomnia and eight to twelve weeks in case of anxiety, including tapering off process.</P>
    <P>Rohypnol may only be obtained on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner and there is a need for a greater awareness among medical practitioners of the problems which can arise when Rohypnol or other controlled drugs are prescribed in an inappropriate fashion. My Department's chief medical officer has written various letters to general practitioners concerning the need to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs.</P>
    <P>Rohypnol falls into the group of drugs know as benzodiazepines. I set up a committee last June, whose terms of reference are to examine the current prescribing and use of benzodiazepines, to consider recommendations on good prescribing and dispensing practice, paying particular attention to the management of drug misusers, and to make recommendations as appropriate. I expect this committee to report to me by the middle of this year.</P>

      <P>Information from the National Intellectual Disability Database indicates that in April 1999, 854 persons with an intellectual disability were resident in psychiatric hospitals. For 307 individuals their current day and residential programmes within the psychiatric services are deemed to be appropriate and they have no identified service needs in the period 2000-2004. Of the remaining 547 people who require services, 54 will continue to reside within the psychiatric hospital setting, but require appropriate day services in the period 2000-2004. The balance of 493 persons need to transfer to the intellectual disability services, with the majority &ndash; 436 people &ndash; requiring both residential and day placements.

    <P>My Department is currently engaged in a major capital programme which has, as one of its main objectives, the transfer of those currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals <Col N="460" /> and other inappropriate placements to more suitable care settings. There are a wide number of developments at varying stages of either planning or construction around the country. Over 100 persons will be moving into new purpose built accommodation this year, with similar facilities for around a further 100 coming on stream by the end of 2002. Plans for the provision of further alternative accommodation, including community group homes and purpose built facilities, for this group are the subject of discussions with the relevant health boards. In addition, to the provision of alternative facilities, a programme of refurbishment of existing facilities which will continue to be used in the short to medium term is also under way.</P>

      <P>The second schedule of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Section 9 of the regulations states that &ldquo;a health board shall disregard the first £6,000 of any asset or assets owned or enjoyed by the person in assessing the value of assets available to a person applying for a nursing home subvention to fund his or her nursing home care.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those <Col N="461" /> older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance. As part of an overall review of the nursing home scheme, my Department is currently examining a number of aspects of the Nursing Home Regulations, which includes a review of the value placed on the savings and assets of each applicant when calculating his or her means.</P>

      <P>Research has been commissioned on the impact of alcohol advertising on young people. This research is due to be published shortly and this will help inform future policy in this regard. A national three year alcohol awareness campaign will be launched next month. The purpose of this campaign is to raise awareness of inappropriate or high-risk drinking and related harm as a public health issue at a national level, while actively encouraging community action through local agencies and groups to reduce alcohol-related problems at local level. Adolescents and parents will be supported during the first year and young adults will also be targeted to address binge drinking.</P>
      <P>The unit has also, in association with the drinks industry, established a training programme for bar staff on the responsible serving of alcohol. This programme addresses such issues as under age drinking, dealing with intoxicated customers and with drinking and driving.</P>

    <P>The waiting times for hip operations in Cappagh Hospital, in the format collected by my Department at 30 September 2000, the latest date <Col N="462" /> for which figures are available, was 185 people waiting for between three to 12 months and 68 people waiting for over 12 months. Partial hip replacement operations are carried out at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin 4. Details of the waiting times for these procedures at St. Vincent's Hospital are not available from the waiting list data collected by my Department.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001 following the significant success experienced in this area last year. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been allocated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of paediatric health services in the eastern region rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I am aware that the Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children has submitted a proposal for development to the authority and that this is being examined by the authority in the context of the overall national development plan and the delivery of paediatric services in the eastern region as a whole. The authority will arrive at a decision in relation to the development proposal in discussion with the hospital, based on priority of need and in the context of competing demands on the authority for funding for new developments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has already sanctioned a major theatre development at the hospital. This theatre development, when completed, will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. The necessary planning for this work is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that tenders for the work will issue in March 2001 with commencement of work shortly thereafter. This development is expected to cost in the region of £20 million.</P>

      <P>Under Article 12 of the Medical Preparations (Advertising) Regulations, 1993, a health professional, which includes doctors, shall not solicit or accept any inducement in the form of gifts, pecuniary advantages, or benefits in kind, unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine and pharmacy. In addition, a person providing hospitality to a health professional in the course of sales promotion shall ensure that such hospitality is reasonable in level and secondary to the main purpose of the meeting and that it is not extended to other than health professionals.</P>
      <P>In support of these regulations, the pharmaceutical industry was required to introduce The Code of Marketing Practice in consultation with my Department and other interested parties with a view to securing the universal acceptance and adoption of high standards of conduct in the marketing of medicinal products designed for use under medical supervision.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 1993, the advertising of medicinal products for human use in the European Community member states, has been governed by Council Directive 92/28/EEC of 31 March 1992. The code of practice fits into the general framework established by Article 12 Paragraph 4 of the directive, which recognises the role of voluntary control of advertising of medicinal products by self-regulatory bodies and recourse to such bodies.</P>
      <P>This code was approved by my Department under Article 16.2 of the Medical Preparations (Advertising) Regulations, 1993, (S.I. No. 76 of 1993) for the purposes of providing practical guidance in implementing the regulations. Compliance with the advertising regulations is now one of the general conditions applicable to the holding of product authorisations.</P>
      <P>The code emphasises the importance of providing health professionals with accurate, fair and objective information about medicinal products so that rational decisions can be made as to their use. In addition, the code accepts the principle that such information should be presented in a form and by ways and means which conform not only to legal requirements but also to professional standards of ethics and good taste.</P>
      <P>Acceptance and observance of the provisions of the code are a condition of membership of the pharmaceutical division of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association. Companies observing the code also acknowledge that its provisions are to be applied in the spirit, as well as in the letter.</P>

On behalf of the Forum on Fluoridation its chairman, Professor Pat Fottrell, presented the forum's interim report to me on 20 December 2000. I have arranged for a copy of the interim report to be forwarded to the Deputies.</P>
      <P>The interim report gives details of the four meetings of the forum which were held from September 2000 to December 2000, inclusive. It highlights the forum's desire to maximise engagement with the views of members of the public and interested bodies. To this end, advertisements were placed in the national newspapers at the end of November 2000 inviting submissions from the public on the issues under discussion and it is hoped to run a series of radio advertisements to this effect shortly. It also stresses the forum's efforts to achieve balanced debate on the issues under discussion. Two internationally renowned anti-fluoridation speakers gave presentations to the forum at a meeting which was held in October 2000 and further speakers have been invited. At the request of the forum, I recently appointed a member of the Irish Doctors' Environmental Association as a representative of those with anti-fluoridation concerns. The final report of the Forum on Fluoridation is due in September 2001.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines increased by one third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001. In the budget 2001 package, this Government announced its intention to extend the eligibility for a medical card to all persons over the age of 70 regardless of income to come into effect on 1 July 2001.</P>

    <P>These arrears payments arose from an incorrect application within these board areas of Article 8.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid.</P>
    <P>The sum of £4 million was not provided solely for the purposes of Article 8.2 arrears payments. Health boards were also incurring additional expenditure as a result of the easing of family circumstances regulations in 1996. The funding was intended to address both issues and to meet funding shortfalls in the scheme generally.</P>

Under the National Development Plan 2001-06 a total of £14.77 million was allocated to the South Eastern Health Board for capital investment in the development of services for older people. It is a matter for the board to decide its priority development projects as part of the national development plan. Accordingly, the question of proceeding with the development of the district hospital in Castlecomer will have to be considered by the board within the parameters of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2001-2006 a total of £14.77 million was allocated to the South Eastern Health Board for capital investment in the development of services for older people. It is a matter for the board to decide its priority development projects within the national development plan. In this context the board has submitted a list of priority projects, which encompasses the provision of new community hospitals and elderly mentally infirm units, upgrading of facilities and the provision of additional day care centres.</P>
      <P>The board has advised that within the context of its overall development plans a further £67 million approximately would be required to develop both community and hospital based services for older people. The Government provided considerable additional revenue resources in 2001 in respect of services for older people and the need to further develop residential and community facilities for older people will continue to be given priority. In this connection, a new health strategy is being prepared by my Department which will encompass a number of specific areas for priority service development, including services for older people. My Department will continue to liaise with the South Eastern Health Board in relation to progressing the board's development plan for services for older people within the context of the national development plan and the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <P>Under the initiative a nurse or midwife undertaking certain specialist courses will receive full pay while doing so. He-she will also be entitled to have his-her fees paid in full. This is in return for a commitment on the part of the nurse or midwife to continue working within the public health service in the specialist area for one year, 12 months, following completion of the course.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are effective from the current academic year and will apply to post-registration courses in the following areas of clinical practice: accident and emergency critical care, including ITU, CCU, cardiac and burns, peri-operative, including peri-anaesthesia, operating theatre and operating department.</P>

      <P>I have received the letter referred to by the Deputy and I have replied to the organisation concerned. As I explained in my reply, I have made funding available to the Health Service Employers Agency to employ a nurse manager to co-ordinate the provision of supervised clinical placements for nurses recruited from abroad. As you are aware, nurses from the Philippines and certain other non-EU countries are required to undertake such placements prior to registration with An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of nurses from abroad is helping to ease staffing difficulties across a range of health care settings. However, some problems have arisen in relation to the availability of supervised clinical placements, and I am determined that nurses requiring such placements will be provided with them. The Health Service Employers Agency co-ordinator will have a nationwide remit in ensuring the availability of sufficient clinical placements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also met with representatives of An Bord Altranais to discuss the need for greater flexibility in relation to the clinical sites where nurses from abroad may undertake their super<Col N="479" /> vised placements. The board has responded positively to certain proposals made by me in this regard.</P>
    <P>My Department is providing funding to teaching hospitals involved in the provision of supervised clinical placements in respect of the salary of a clinical co-ordinator, and clerical support, for the duration of such placements. Since this is the biggest single cost element, the availability of funding to cover it will greatly reduce the overall cost to agencies, such as nursing homes, which are recruiting nurses from non-EU countries. Other costs associated with these placements, including vaccination and meals, will continue to be a matter for negotiation between the individual hospital and prospective employer concerned.</P>

      <P>The meningococcal C immunisation programme commenced in October 2000. The aim of the programme is to immunise all persons up to 22 years of age. Phase 1 of the programme is targeting those at greatest risk; children under five years and young persons aged 15 to 18 years. Once Phase 1 has been completed, there will be a continuing &lsquo;catch-up' programme from spring 2001 targeting 5 to 14 and 19 to 22 year olds. While it is as yet too early to establish the precise level of uptake being achieved in relation to the meningococcal C vaccine, preliminary indications are that uptake is generally good. Uptake in the third level population is not satisfactory, however, and new initiatives to target this group are being developed.</P>
      <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre has advised that the provisional number of cases of Meningitis B and C reported by each health board in the six-month period July to December 2000 is as follows:</P>

      <P>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease &ndash; CJD &ndash; and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease &ndash; vCJD &ndash; are notifiable diseases under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations, 1996, which came into effect on 16 December 1996. Under the regulations all cases of CJD and vCJD which are definitively diagnosed are required to be reported. The number of cases of CJD reported in each of the years since 1997 is as follows: 1997, 3; 1998, 6; 1999, 1; 2000, 2.</P>
      <P>There was also one case of vCJD in 1999.</P>
      <P>The number of persons who have died of CJD in 1995 and 1996 was two and three respectively.</P>
      <P>In order to establish the true incidence of CJD and to determine any changes in the pattern and/or nature of its occurrence, a national surveillance unit has been established and is based at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. Among the objectives of this unit are to build a database of information on CJD cases in Ireland and to provide a facility to medical practitioners for the verification of suspected cases of the disease.</P>
      <P>The CJD advisory group was established in 1996 to advise the Minister for Health and Children on CJD-related matters including surveillance, research strategies and international developments generally in relation to this disease, and to provide advice on particular issues referred to the Group from time to time by the Minister. The advisory group comprises experts in neurology, neuropathology, haematology, food safety, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology. My Department is also represented.</P>
      <P>Ireland also participates in the European surveillance programme on CJD.</P>

This review is in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is in the process of completing a detailed assessment of bed capacity requirements for the region. The study will aim to systematically forecast the supply by specialty of in-patient, day care and elderly non-acute beds which are required. I expect to receive this report in the coming weeks. The results of this study will inform the preparation of a national assessment of future bed requirements. I propose to bring a report on this matter to Government in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Nurse staffing difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the situation is improving in this area following recent recruitment initiatives and as recruitment of nurses from abroad begins to pay dividends.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; is undertaking a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2001 which should confirm these indications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> Nationally, action is being taken across a number of fronts to try to improve the situation. For example:</P>
    <P>New arrangements have been introduced to give better starting pay to nurses taking up employment by giving full recognition for previous experience at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced.</P>
    <P>A significantly improved regime of allowance in respect of nurses working in specialised areas has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels and the opportunities for increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing staff. Both of these recommendations are being addressed by a joint committee representative of nursing unions and health service employers. A separate working party to establish standard criteria in relation to education and training of care assistants has also been convened.</P>
    <P>The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing and the 1999 nurses' pay settlement.</P>
    <P>A major new recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives. A new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service will come into operation on 1 February. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis.</P>
    <P>As part of my overall recruitment/retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses: payment of fees to nurses/midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses/midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses/midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>An advertising campaign aimed at attracting nurses back into the workforce and at attracting nurses back to Ireland ran from 30 November to 31 December 2000. This generated a significant number of inquiries.</P>
    <P>The number of nursing training places has been increased by 300 to 1,500 until at least <Col N="485" /> 2002. A further 20 places have been filled on a new direct entry midwifery programme which has been introduced on a pilot basis. Over 1,500 nursing students started training in October 2000 with record intakes to both psychiatric and mental handicap nursing. In order to increase the number of general nursing training places in Dublin, funding has been provided to St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, to commence the pre-registration nursing diploma programme this autumn with an annual intake of 40 students.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in strategic planning through the study of the nursing and midwifery resource. The focus of this work is on longer term planning. The primary objective of the study is to forecast, as far as is possible, future nursing and midwifery workforce needs. An interim report was published in October 2000 and widely circulated within the health services. My £5 million recruitment/retention initiative of 29 November last was an immediate response to a number of the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the establishment of a working group to look specifically at the situation in the Dublin area are almost finalised. This group will examine factors affecting the recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery staff in the Dublin area and recommend innovative ways in which the situation might be improved.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> As can be seen from the table above cases of HIV have risen over the last number of years. However, the incidence of AIDS has declined. This is due, at least partly, to the impact of highly active anti-retroviral treatments which were introduced in 1996. These treatments slow down the progression of the disease, hence people infected with HIV do not develop AIDS as quickly as before.</P>
    <P>The figures for the first six months of 2000 show a significant increase on previous years. Last June, my colleague, Minister of State, Moffatt, as Chair of the National AIDS Strategy Committee &ndash; NASC &ndash; published AIDS Strategy 2000 which makes recommendations in relation to strategies for HIV-AIDS in the coming years. NASC through its sub-committees will be asked to push ahead with implementing these recommendations so as to ensure that we are in a position to respond effectively to emerging trends.</P>

      <P>An additional £830,000 is being provided to health boards for suicide prevention and research. This includes an additional £100,000 for the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork to support its work for the development of a national parasuicide register. The primary aims of the foundation are to define the true extent of the problem of suicidal behaviour in Ireland; to identify and measure the factors which induce and protect against suicidal behaviour and to develop strategies aimed at preventing suicidal behaviour.</P>
      <P>The remaining funding has been allocated to health boards to further progress the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the national task force on suicide. These measures will include the recruitment of additional staff, the provision of staff training in risk assessment, production of information literature and events aimed at raising public awareness of suicide and parasuicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the task force on suicide.

    <P>provision of information and training on suicide prevention to relevant professionals and organisations,</P>
    <P>research into suicide prevention.</P>
    <P>All health boards have appointed resource officers to further the implementation of the strategy within their own areas.

      <P>EU legislative requirements in relation to medicinal products are covered by Council Directive 65/65/EEC, as amended, which lays down special provisions for medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma i.e. blood products. The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the competent authority for the purposes of this directive. The IMB was established under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, to licence the manufacture, preparation, importation, distribution and sale of medicinal products in Ireland. The remit also includes the regulation of medicinal products, including blood products, used in Ireland. The board also has responsibility for the supervision and control of medicinal products placed on the market in this country. All medicinal products, including blood products, used in Ireland are licensed and monitored by the IMB which is a guarantee of their compliance with Council Directive 65/65/EEC. However, Council Directive 65/65/EEC, as amended, specifically excludes blood components such as whole blood, plasma and blood cells of human origin.</P>
      <P>The IMB is also the regulatory authority for the collection, screening, processing and quality control facilities in respect of human blood, blood components and blood products. The lMB inspects the IBTS by conducting two full inspections and investigations each year, and reports annually to the Minister on these inspections. The IMB apply the following EU directives and guidelines in their inspections of the IBTS:</P>
      <P>&ndash;EC Directive No. 91/356/EEC dated 13 July 1991 which lays down the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice for medicinal products for human use;</P>
      <P>&ndash;European Community Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products (vol. IV of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Community);</P>
      <P>&ndash;Guide to the Preparation, Use and Quality Assurance of Blood Components (5th edition, 1999) Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>Three annual reports have been presented and published to date which outline the significant progress made by the IBTS in ensuring compliance, nevertheless, specific instances of non-compliance have been reported which are being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently no EU directives which deal specifically with blood safety and quality, although there are a number of relevant Community initiatives in this area. The most recent and most significant is Council Recommendation No 98/463/EC of 29 June 1998 on the suitability of blood and plasma donors and the screening of <Col N="491" /> donated blood in the Community. I have been advised that the IBTS complies with all provisions of this recommendation.</P>
    <P>The European Commission, under the current Swedish Presidency, is considering a draft proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council entitled &ldquo;Proposal for a directive setting high standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components in order to ensure a high level of human health protection in the Community&rdquo;. My Department, in consultation with the IBTS and the IMB, are contributing to the development of this directive and I am assured that the level of compliance with the current provisions of the draft directive is very high. For my part, I will ensure that the IBTS has adequate resources to introduce any new measures which may be necessary to ensure full compliance with the directive once it is adopted.</P>

      <P>There are two major out of hours general practitioner co-operative projects currently under way in the SEHB and the NEHB. These are pilot projects which are set to be rigorously and independently evaluated in March. My Department has provided funding for both those projects and has also provided, in the current year, significant funding to the SHB to develop a major structured <Col N="492" /> out of hours GP model covering west Cork and Kerry. Funds have also been provided to the other health boards and the ERHA to facilitate infrastructural analysis and consideration of appropriate out of hours GP structures in their regions.</P>
      <P>The future development of the structured out of hours model, either in the form of a co-operative or other structured model, throughout the country, will be progressed on the basis of both the aforementioned evaluation exercise and a national conference on the subject being organised by my Department for late spring. Arrangements for the establishment of a working group to look specifically at the situation in the Dublin area are almost finalised. This group will examine factors affecting the recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery staff in the Dublin area and recommend innovative ways in which the situation might be improved.</P>
      <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>

      <P>The Department has approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of tax credits on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The group has set a target date of 1 April this year for the implementation of the pilot scheme.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services, including occupational therapy services, to persons with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the relevant health board. Accordingly, the Deputy's questions, including the questions regarding named individuals, have been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are staff shortages in the therapy grades in the health service. In order to address these shortages my Department has engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including occupational therapists. This report is expected within the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on various health professionals made recommendations in relation to an enhanced career structure for occupational therapists. This has resulted in a large number of occupational therapists being upgraded. It has also led to the creation of a clinical specialist post for the therapy grades. The creation of this grade will allow for career progression for those who do not want to move into management. It will also ensure that clinical expertise is not lost to the professions.</P>

      <P>TES Consulting Engineers, formerly Tobin Environmental Services Limited, were appointed as the monitoring body for the national litter pollution monitoring system for a three year period in May 1999. To date, a total of £176,900 has been paid to the company in respect of its work as monitoring body.</P>
      <P>The principal objectives of the monitoring system are to monitor and assess local authority litter management and enforcement action. Under the system, local authorities are to carry out local litter surveys to identify systematically the composition and extent of litter pollution in their areas. Local authorities will be able to use data from the surveys to refine needs and priorities at local level to prevent and control litter, and to target anti-litter action accordingly. The surveys will also establish benchmark assessments of the extent of the litter problem in each local authority area, against which progress can be judged.</P>
      <P>Under the system, the monitoring body is responsible for determining the survey methodologies, obtaining and reviewing local authority survey reports, and assessing action by local authorities on foot of the survey results. At this stage, considerable work has been carried out by the monitoring body in planning and developing the monitoring system and the next step is for local authorities to carry out the necessary litter surveys in their areas; this will be the main focus of the work over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its role, the monitoring body has also evaluated local authority litter management plans and forwarded the results to the individual local authorities. This will help ensure a consistently higher standard of litter management plan as a basis for local authority action against litter. In addition, the monitoring body is reviewing best practices for the prevention and control of litter <Col N="496" /> and disseminating this information to local authorities; this will also be included in a planned web-site.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 761, 810, 860 and 861 together.</P>
      <P>Discussions regarding the new taxi regime have taken place between my Department and taxi interests, both in multilateral sessions involving all main representative groups and in bilateral contacts.</P>
      <P>My Department has made clear in these discussions that the Government does not acknowledge a duty of compensation in relation to the loss of the secondary market value of taxi licences nor is it proposed to provide such compensation.</P>
      <P>Equally, my Department has sought to progress agreement with taxi interests on the mitigating measures for certain existing taxi licence holders envisaged in the new regime announced by the Government. Further details regarding capital tax allowances have recently been published by the Department of Finance. Under the Finance Bill, 2001, it will be proposed that taxi licence owners at 21 November 2000 may write off the actual cost to them of the taxi licences as a capital allowance. A write-off period of five years in line with the new write-off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery will apply and the commencement of the write-off period will be back-dated for three years to 21 November 1997.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed to develop an administrative scheme to address high licensing fees paid to certain local authorities for the grant of certain taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences. My Department will issue instructions on this matter to relevant licensing authorities in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding wheelchair accessibility, I have already put on record my intention that, by end <Col N="498" /> 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible. It is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term. These may include, if appropriate, further improvements of the existing specification for wheelchair accessible taxis. These initiatives represent a very significant effort to improve the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 736 and 838 together.</P>
      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. Where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major structural works to designated estates, the installation of central heating in houses may form part of the works undertaken.</P>
      <P>Local authorities may also seek approval to the use of their internal capital receipts, which are surplus to the requirements of their local authority housing programme and remedial works scheme, for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings. Apart from the foregoing my Department has no capital allocation from which to fund the installation of central heating in local authority housing generally.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation wrote to my Department in June last seeking funding for the provision and upgrading of central heating in the remainder of their rented houses, which they estimate to be approximately 4,000, which lack the facility at an estimated cost of some £16 million. My Department's position was outlined in a reply to the Corporation in September last on the lines of the above.</P>

      <P>In June 2000, following a comprehensive review of Part M of the building regulations, I made amended regulations. I also published a revised edition of Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access for People with Disabilities, on how to comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>The amended Part M, which came into effect on 1 January 2001, requires that all new houses be visitable by people with disabilities. The main features of visitable housing include:</P>

      <P>level access at entry door;</P>

      <P>The number of days the Flood tribunal has sat in public to 26 January 2001 is 243. The cost of the tribunal to the 26 January 2001 is £9,644,877.15. The chairman of the tribunal, Mr Justice Flood, has granted limited representation to a number of parties at the public sittings of the tribunal. A list of these parties, as provided by the tribunal, is set out in table A below. It should be noted that there are a number of parties who have appeared at the tribunal with representation but have not been granted limited representation by the sole member.</P>
      <P>No costs have been awarded to any member of any legal team. The tribunal has stated that in cases where representation is granted it does not imply any guarantee that costs will be awarded to the person to whom representation was granted. In addition, the tribunal has clearly indicated that, save in exceptional circumstances, where the tribunal decides to make an order granting costs to a person, the tribunal will only certify the costs of one solicitor, one junior counsel and one senior counsel.</P>
      <P>A list of the members of the Flood tribunal's legal team is set out in table B below, including the payments made to each individual to 26 January 2001. The payments are inclusive of VAT but exclusive of with-holding tax which has been deducted at the appropriate rate.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received correspondence from Wicklow County Council regarding the draft development plans for Kilcoole, and Newtownmountkennedy, County Wicklow; if he has satisfied himself that these plans comply with the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 766 and 863 together.</P>
      <P>Statutory recognition for the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area is provided for in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The relevant provisions, which came into force on 1 January 2001, require planning authorities in the area to have regard to the guidelines when making and adopting a development plan. Pending the commencement of the statutory provision, I formally requested, in April 1999, that each local authority in the greater Dublin area should ensure that its development plan is in line with the strategy set out in the strategic planning guidelines. A further letter of 14 August 2000 also asked planning authorities to advise the Department as to progress to date in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is a statutory consultee for all development plans. In accordance with normal practice, the Department, on my behalf, has examined the draft variations to the Wicklow county development plan which include town development plans in respect of Kilcoole and Newtownmountkennedy. In the light of that examination my Department wrote to Wicklow County Council on 23 January 2001 seeking comments on the compatibility of the proposals for Kilcoole and Newtownmountkennedy with the strategic planning guidelines and the Wicklow county development plan. Pending receipt of the council's reply, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 767 and 806 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 284 of 5 December 2000. The text of a treaty to address certain persistent organic pollutants &ndash; POPs &ndash; was agreed at the INC-5 session held in Johannesburg on 4-9 December 2000. The treaty will be formally adopted and opened for signature at a diplomatic conference in Stockholm on 22-23 May 2001. I will be seeking Government approval to sign the convention on behalf of Ireland. Thereafter, I intend that Ireland will work towards ratification of the treaty in the context, <i>inter alia,</i> of the development by the Environmental Protection Agency of national POPs emissions inventories, progress on the ratification of the 1998 UNECE (Aarhus) POPs Protocol and ratification of the treaty by the European Community. The treaty enters into force following ratification by 50 countries. I am not in a position to estimate the timescale involved.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of waste incineration in this context, the 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways recommended that local authorities identify and assess a range of waste treatment technologies, with a view to the development of an integrated waste management infrastructure appropriate to their particular circumstances. Thermal treatment of waste, carried out in accordance with high environmental standards, is regarded as environmentally preferable to the disposal of waste by landfill, and plays a major part in municipal waste management in many EU countries, and further afield. Accordingly, Changing our Ways proposed that, where technically and economically feasible, and subject to appropriate attention to materials recycling, incineration with energy recovery or other advanced thermal processes are among the treatment options which should be considered in an integrated waste management strategy. This remains the case and is not incompatible with the provisions of either the UNECE (Aarhus) POPs Protocol or the treaty to be adopted and signed in Stockholm in May next.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 768, 774, 783, 813 and 857 together.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August 2000. In view of the scale and complexity of the provisions of the Act, and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. To date, I have made two commencement orders bringing a number of Parts of the Act into force on 1 November 2000 and 1 January 2001. These include Part II on development plans, Part V on the supply of housing, Part IX on strategic development zones, Part XIV on the acquisition of land and Part XX which amends the Roads Act, 1993. Regulations are currently being prepared by my Department which will enable me to bring the development control provisions of the Act (including the provisions in Part XV concerning development on the foreshore) into force. Some of these regulations require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and I propose to submit draft regulations for approval before the end of March. In addition to the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, development on the foreshore is subject to the requirements of the Foreshore Acts, 1933 to 1998, which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <P>Leenane and Kilkerrin sewerage schemes were approved for funding under the rural towns and villages initiative in 1999. The updated preliminary reports for both schemes were approved last November and the submission of contract documents by Galway County Council is now awaited.</P>
      <P>Tully sewerage scheme is included in my Department's water services investment programme, 2000-02, as a scheme to start construction in 2001. The preliminary report for this scheme is currently under consideration in my Department and a decision will be made on it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A revised preliminary report for the Clonbur sewerage scheme was received in November 1999 but has not been approved. This scheme was included in a list of sewerage schemes for the period 2007-18 submitted by Galway County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services <Col N="508" /> investment programme, 2000-02, announced last July. Given the priority rating afforded to this scheme by the council, the level of competing demands and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time. However, I understand that Galway County Council is now proposing to advance the scheme under the devolved small schemes programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have commissioned three major reports on the housing market with a particular focus on the supply and demand for housing and the affordability of housing. The Government has responded positively to the findings of these reports in Action on House Prices (April 1998), Action on the Housing Market (March 1999) and Action on Housing (June 2000).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has implemented a wide range of measures to boost housing output, remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development and improve affordability for first-time buyers and lower income households. There is clear evidence both from the most recent analysis of the housing situation and from the latest housing trends that the Government's actions over the last few years have made a significant impact, in the face of strongly rising demand for housing. Government strategy, which is proving effective, is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers. New housing output in 1999 was over 46,500 units, an <Col N="510" /> increase of 20% over 1997, and output in 2000 is provisionally estimated at almost 50,000 units, a 29% increase on output in 1997.</P>
    <P>House price data for recent months indicate further moderation in the rate of increase in average house prices. There is also firm evidence that first-time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market. These trends may be attributed to reduced investor activity in response to measures introduced in Action on Housing and the sustained increases in housing output. The provision of £6 billion for social and affordable housing in the national development plan, augmented by further investment of almost £1 billion announced in Action on Housing, will ensure that the social and affordable housing needs of almost 100,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>Last May I launched the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness, which outlines a new approach to the way in which services for the homeless are to be planned, funded and provided. As part of the strategy, local authorities have established homeless fora, where they were not already in place, and are developing three year action plans, jointly with the health boards and voluntary bodies. These action plans will set out clear aims and actions on how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved. While it will take some time to ensure that all these services are put in place, it is vital that services for homeless persons should be improved in the meantime and I continue to urge local authorities to provide directly or acquire additional premises for use as accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, requires local authorities to prepare housing strategies to address the housing needs of all sectors of the community, including those in need of social and affordable housing. This requires local authorities to make an assessment of current and projected needs for housing in their areas, to prepare housing strategies and vary their development plans to incorporate the strategies. Guidelines for planning authorities on the preparation of their housing strategies, together with a model housing strategy have been published. Authorities have been asked to complete their housing strategies by 1 August 2001 at the latest.</P>
    <P>The Government is committing substantial additional resources to housing and housing-related infrastructural development, over and above that which has been committed in the national development plan and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These further measures provide a comprehensive and coherent response to growing housing need. They are kept under review on an ongoing basis and the Government will not hesitate to introduce additional measures should the need be established.</P>

      <P>Other issues under consideration by the working group include direct access to the Housing Finance Agency for funding for approved voluntary housing bodies, funding for running costs incurred by voluntary housing bodies in their housing projects and the whole issue of funding for the sector including financial support for approved voluntary housing bodies. In addition to advising on issues affecting development of the voluntary housing sector, the working group also acts as a valuable channel of communication between the sector and my Department.</P>

      <P>The payment of fees for professional services relating to local authority housing schemes is primarily a matter for each local authority. In relation to voluntary housing schemes, the question of the payment of fees for professional services to consultants involved in voluntary housing projects is a matter for the voluntary bodies who have engaged the consultants in the first place. However, a local authority may give a guarantee to an approved voluntary housing body in respect of any borrowings that may be necessary to enable planning of a project to proceed in the early stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> Payments are not made by my Department to local authorities in relation to social housing schemes in advance of the commencement of works. I would be concerned that there should be no undue delays in the payment of fees for professional services by local authorities and any individual case should be pursued directly with the relevant local authority. I should add that local authorities are required to comply with the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, which requires local authorities to pay invoices within a statutory period of 45 days or such shorter period as may be agreed by contract.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last May I launched the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness, which outlines a new approach to the way in which services for the homeless are to be planned, funded and provided. As part of the strategy, local authorities have established homeless fora, where they were not already in place, and are in the process of <Col N="513" /> developing three year action plans, jointly with the health boards and voluntary bodies. These action plans will set out clear aims and actions on how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved.</P>
    <P>The most recent assessment of housing needs, which was undertaken in March 1999, indicated that there were 3,918 homeless persons in the wider Dublin area. It must be emphasised, however, that while they are classified as homeless the vast majority are not sleeping rough on the streets. Some are in hostels, some are in bed and breakfast accommodation and some are staying with parents or friends. Figures published recently by Simon and Outreach suggested an increase in the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin city centre. However, there was a degree of selectivity in the data published. The published figures indicated results of counts of homeless persons sleeping rough for 1997, 1998 and 2000 but omitted the 1999 results. Moreover, the figures for 1997 and 1998 appear to have been understated. Had the 1999 figures been included in the comparison, it would have revealed a significant reduction in the number of homeless persons sleeping rough in the city centre, from 261 in 1999 to 202 in 2000. Leaving aside the issue of statistics, I am concerned that even one person should be homeless and forced to sleep on the streets of Dublin or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The homeless strategy also calls for additional night-time services to be provided for homeless persons, particularly in Dublin. As part of the action plan for Dublin, which is currently being considered by the housing strategic policy committees of the four Dublin authorities, additional facilities and emergency accommodation will be provided for rough sleepers. The Government has made substantial current and capital funding available to ensure that the measures outlined in the strategy are implemented. Capital spending by local authorities on accommodation for homeless is to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million over five years. An extra £6 million per annum in current funding will be available from my Department to fund voluntary bodies, to increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation and to establish settlement and outreach services. Additional funding will also be available from health boards to fund care and welfare requirements. Voluntary bodies will also continue to provide additional accommodation for homeless persons under the voluntary housing scheme operated by my Department.</P>
    <P>A special allocation of £5 million over the years 2000 and 2001 was made in Budget 2000 specifically for the provision of two high support hostels for homeless people suffering from drug and alcohol addictions. Dublin Corporation, in co-operation with other agencies, are hopeful that suitable premises will be sourced shortly.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector considered in detail the merits and impact of various forms of rent control and there was unanimous agreement within the commission that it would not be appropriate to recommend the introduction of a comprehensive form of rent control. The commission considered the appropriate rent to be the open market rate and recommended that rent reviews should occur no more frequently than once yearly, unless there has been a substantial improvement in the property in the interim. The Government has accepted in full the commission's recommendation on rents and the preparation of legislation to give statutory effect to this recommendation is now commencing.</P>
      <P>The key to stabilising rents in the private rented residential sector is, in the final analysis, the same as that for stabilising the housing market as a whole, that is by increasing the supply of housing. The availability of section 23 type relief for designated urban and renewal areas, the tax reliefs included in the new town renewal and living over the shop schemes, section 50 relief for the provision of student accommodation, the rent a room scheme announced in the recent budget and the tax and supply incentives to be included in the Finance Bill, 2001, arising from the Government response to the commission's report are all designed to increase the supply of private rented accommodation.</P>

Waterford County Council recently appointed consultants to prepare a preliminary report for all seven schemes.

      <P>It is estimated that between 55% and 60% of the current housing stock in Meath was built prior to 1980. There are a range of variables <Col N="516" /> that impact upon CO2 emissions from households including the level of heating, the insulation-air filtration characteristics of the dwelling and the efficiency of the heating system, determined by the type of fuel and appliance used.</P>
      <P>Many dwellings that are less well insulated or use less efficient heating systems maintain a lower heating level. Accordingly, improved insulation levels may not always correspond with emissions reduction through reduced energy use but may instead result in higher heating levels. However, it is generally considered that there is potential for a saving of the order of 25% in energy use in older housing stock and possibly higher emissions reduction if switching from use of solid fuels is taken into account.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing a scheme whereby certain categories of dog owners could obtain a dog licence at a reduced rate has been examined. While it is recognised that a dog can provide both a sense <Col N="517" /> of security and companionship to many elderly people and to people living alone, it would not, unfortunately, be feasible to introduce such a scheme without incurring substantial administrative costs and a loss of revenue to the local authorities, who rely on the revenue from the sale of dog licences to finance their dog control activities. At a practical level also, such a scheme would give rise to difficulties for local authorities in attempting to establish the true ownership of a dog which was covered by a reduced fee licence but which was being kept by a person who was not eligible for such a licence.</P>

      <P>Single people are not debarred from consideration by local authorities for assistance in meeting their housing needs through any of the range of social and affordable housing schemes administered by local authorities. The most recent assessment of need for local authority housing indicated that 29% of households assessed as being in need of local authority housing, and accordingly accepted onto local authority housing waiting lists, were single person households. Inclusion on the waiting list for local authority housing confers eligibility for consideration for the range of social and affordable housing schemes, particularly local authority rented housing, housing provided by voluntary bodies, and the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes.</P>
      <P>Applications for inclusion on local authority waiting lists are assessed on the basis of the household's circumstances. The allocation of local authority rented housing is based on a number of criteria taking account of the household's situation and the competing priorities of other applicant households. Local authorities have been advised by my Department that it should be the aim of a scheme of letting priorities to promote equality of opportunity in getting access to local authority housing based on relative needs to ensure a dwelling, if suitable, is let to the person in greatest need and to ensure that no category of need, including single people, is at a permanent disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories.</P>

    <P>A combined brief for all these schemes was received in my Department last November but has not been approved. The Elphin, Frenchpark, Ballinlough and Rooskey schemes were included as long-term objectives (2006-26) in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessment. The other two schemes were not included in the council's assessment. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02, announced last July. Given the priority rating afforded to these schemes by the council, the <Col N="523" /> level of competing demands and the funding available, it was not possible to include them in the programme at that time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 801 and 841 together.</P>
      <P>Roscommon County Council and Longford County Council were allocated non-national road grants totalling £8.662 million and £4.542 million, respectively, in 2000, an increase of 10% and 11% on the previous year's grants allocations and 50% and 44%, respectively, on the 1997 allocations. In principle, the very considerable funds available to local authorities for non-national roads maintenance and improvement are designed to cover contingencies arising from flooding, storm damage and other severe weather conditions. My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads provides that the cost of remedial works necessitated by such conditions must be met from these resources and that local authorities should set aside contingency sums to finance these works.</P>
      <P>My Department is also prepared to consider sympathetically any request from local authorities to adjust their current multi-annual restoration programmes so as to prioritise works necessitated by flood damage to particular roads. I intend to announce non-national road grant allocations for 2001 very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Nitrate vulnerable zones have not yet been formally designated in any county. EU <Col N="524" /> Directive 91/676/EEC (the Nitrates Directive) requires member states to take certain measures to identify waters affected by pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources; to identify the land areas, or catchments, which drain into the affected waters, and to designate such areas as nitrate vulnerable zones. Special action programmes must be developed and implemented in these areas to reduce and prevent pollution of waters by nitrates. A primary consideration is the management of manures and fertilisers.</P>
      <P>I indicated in a press statement on 15 July 2000 that a panel of experts had identified certain groundwaters in five counties &ndash; Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Louth and Waterford &ndash; as affected waters; that nitrates levels in these waters are approaching or, in some cases exceeding, the limits set by European legislation, and that the relevant county councils were being asked to identify the catchments involved with a view to the formal designation of these areas as NVZs. Work on identifying the relevant catchments is proceeding. I envisage that the appropriate areas will be designated as NVZs during the current year. Following designation, an action programme must be established within one year in relation to the area for the purposes of reducing and preventing pollution of waters by nitrates from agricultural sources. The programme must be implemented over a four year period.</P>
      <P>The designation of an area as an NVZ will place a higher emphasis on measures that are already in place in practice: the voluntary code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates will become mandatory in an NVZ; the efforts now being applied to reduce the use of phosphorus generally will be extended to nitrogen; and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will actively promote participation in appropriate rural development programmes by farmers in an NVZ. The aforementioned code of good agricultural practice is contained in the Blue Book, issued jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in 1996. It contains advice and recommendations for farmers as to storage of agricultural fertilisers; standards and specifications for construction of storage facilities; when to apply organic and chemical fertilisers to land; appropriate rates of application of fertilisers; and precautions to be taken to avoid causing water pollution. I am keeping under review the need to identify as affected waters other bodies of water which display elevated levels of nitrates.</P>

The main effect of these regulations is to increase the size of domestic extensions that are exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission from 23 square metres to 40 square metres, subject to compliance with specific conditions and limitations. In addition, they contain a number of conditions designed to ensure that the changes in relation to exempted development extensions do not result in any injury to the amenities of adjoining properties.</P>

      <P>Local authorities may borrow from the Housing Finance Agency to acquire land for the provision of housing under the affordable housing scheme. The cost of land acquisition, together with the rolled up interest charges up to a period of seven years may be charged to the scheme.</P>
      <P>As part of the measures to increase the supply of affordable housing set out in Action on Housing, I introduced a site subsidy for houses provided by local authorities under the affordable housing scheme and also in respect of new houses sold by local authorities under the shared ownership scheme. This subsidy enables local authorities to provide housing under the schemes at an affordable price and at a discount from the market value of similar houses in their areas. The maximum subsidy available is £30,000 in the major urban areas of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and £25,000 in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also brought the provisions of the claw-back under the affordable housing scheme in line with the claw-back provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and I extended those provisions to the shared ownership scheme for new houses sold by local authorities at a discount from market value. The claw-back provisions provide that if a house purchased under the affordable housing scheme at a discount is resold before the expiration of 20 years <Col N="527" /> from the date of the purchase, the person selling the property shall pay to the housing authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale. This percentage is equal to the percentage discount allowed by the local authority on the original sale of the house where the house is resold within the first ten years. The amount payable is reduced by 10% in respect of each complete year after the tenth year during which the person who purchased the property has been in occupation as his or her normal place of residence. The provision of a subsidy financed from public funds is necessary to enable eligible low income households to attain home ownership while the provision for a claw-back is necessary to ensure that there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a subsidised house or site.</P>
    <P>Where local authorities use land which has been in their ownership for some time, the historic value of the land plus any loan charges on borrowings for a period of seven years can be recouped by way of the site subsidy. Where local authorities have to buy replacement land for social or affordable housing the site costs plus loan charges will be recouped when schemes are developed on this land subject to the subsidy limits referred to above. While I have no current proposals to increase the level of subsidy or to alter the operational details of the affordable housing scheme I will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dioxins are ubiquitous in the environment, and arise from a range of combustion sources, diffuse and otherwise. In 1997 the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, classed the most toxic dioxin compound as a known human carcinogen. The WHO also considers that there is a level of exposure to dioxins below which cancer risk would be negligible. Accordingly, in 1998, it agreed on a tolerable daily intake guideline for dioxins, based on a thorough evaluation of all available data on the toxicological effects of dioxins, and the most up-to-date methods of interpretation.</P>
      <P>Detailed information regarding the known effects of dioxins on human health is contained in a comprehensive, published, 1999 EU report, Compilation of EU Dioxin Exposure and Health Data. Clearly, because of the potential toxic effects of exposure to dioxins, their emission must, where possible, be strictly controlled and minimised, to ensure that exposure does not exceed relevant guidelines and standards.</P>
      <P>Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for the integrated licensing and comprehensive environmental control of waste incineration facilities. The EPA must take the precautionary principle into account and is precluded from granting an integrated licence unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not endanger human health or harm the environment.</P>
      <P>In licensing incineration facilities, the EPA already applies a flue gas emission limit value for dioxins of 0.1 nanograms, that is one ten thousand millionth of a gram, per cubic metre of gas emitted. This is an extremely stringent standard, which will shortly be adopted by the EU generally, under the proposed Council Directive on the incineration of waste. The European Commission estimates that the implementation of this directive will result in a 99% reduction in emissions of dioxins from waste incineration &ndash; relative to 1993/1995 &ndash; and anticipates that the contribution of municipal and clinical waste incineration to overall emissions of dioxins in Europe would be reduced to 0.3%, assuming the output of other sources remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Overall, I am advised that emissions from proposed new thermal treatment facilities, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, should not have any appreciable environmental impact or contribute significantly to background levels of dioxins locally or nationally.</P>

My Department will draw the attention of road authorities in the context of this sub-programme, as well as in the context of the use of discretionary grants under the non-national roads programme more generally, to the desirability of providing flashing lights in the vicinity of schools on significantly trafficked non-national roads.</P>

      <P>A preliminary report for the south Roscommon regional water supply scheme, which incorporates this proposal, was received in my Department in 1993 but has not been approved. The scheme is included in the list of water schemes submitted by Roscommon County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessment.</P>
      <P>In view of the level of competing demand and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it was not possible to include all schemes proposed by local authorities in the water services investment programme, 2000-02, announced last July. However, this was the first phase of a rolling programme that will continue up to the end of the current national development plan in 2006. Further schemes will be added to the programme on an annual basis during that period. The south Roscommon scheme will continue to be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>Statistics on pass-fail rates generally are available on the NCTS website at www.ncts.ie. In the period 4 January 2000 to 31 December 2000, some 34,000 pre-1992 registered cars exceeded the age-related emissions standards specified as part of the National Car Test. In the same period, a total of 274,355 pre-1992 cars underwent their initial test; 148,159 or 54% of them were unsuccessful and of these, 19,261 cars failed a first re-test. A total of 28,748 initial tests were carried out on cars registered in the years 1992 to 1996. Of these 9,200 were unsuccessful and 930 of them also failed a first re-test.</P>

      <P>Under the national car test scheme, the standards for exhaust emissions are directly related to the year of manufacture of the vehicles to be tested. Cars which are 30 years old or more are not required to undergo the NCT. The emission standards reflect the provisions of EU Directive 96/96/EC on vehicle testing and are mandatory. They are specified in the National Car Test Manual 1999, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any proposals to provide a group water scheme for Firies-Scartaglen. However, proposals to serve the Firies-Scartaglen area by way of a regional water supply scheme have been submit<Col N="538" /> ted to my Department by Kerry County Council. The scheme is included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Kerry County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.</P>
      <P>Because of the level of competing demand and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it was not possible to include all schemes proposed by local authorities in the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002. This is the first phase of a rolling three-year programme that will continue up to the end of the current national development plan in 2006. Further schemes will be added to the Programme on an annual basis during that period. The Firies/Scartaglin scheme will continue to be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 832, 833 and 834 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 indicated that, in common with a majority of EU member states, the Government does not propose at this stage to regulate for a specific prohibition on the use of mobile phones by drivers. The safe use of mobile phones by drivers was instead to be promoted through information campaigns, including campaigns supported by the mobile phone industry. In line with this policy, the National Safety Council have issued an advisory leaflet sponsored by Esat for the safe use of mobile phones by drivers. Another initiative has been a leaflet issued by Eircell and the AA in association with Esso. Notwithstanding the absence of a specific prohibition, use of mobile phone which causes a driver to act in a manner which could be regarded as dangerous or careless may be prosecuted under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NRA Road Accidents Facts reports categorise <Col N="539" /> human behavioural contributions to road accidents in generalised terms: these would not permit identification of such specific factors as unsafe use of a mobile phone.</P>

      <P>There is a range of accommodation provided for homeless persons, from emergency hostel accommodation to transitional and long-term accommodation. Under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 my Department provides 90% recoupment to local authorities for expenditure on the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
      <P>The section 10 bed-night contribution rate is agreed between the local authority and the voluntary body based on the level of homeless need involved. My Department has recommended that the minimum rate should be £10 per bed night and this is set out in the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness. Higher rates may be agreed if individual circumstances warrant it, but my Department is consulted in advance of any such agreement. I have no information on the hostel referred to but if the Deputy could provide some details I will have the circumstances examined.</P>

      <P>Section 150 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides for the adoption by each planning authority, and An Bord Pleanála, of a code of conduct for dealing with conflicts of interest and promoting public confidence in the integrity of its business. It is my intention to bring Section 150 into force in conjunction with the development control provisions of the Act and Regulations are under preparation. These codes of conduct will consist, inter alia, of a policy on undertaking work, not being work on behalf of the authority or the board, as the case may be, both during and after any period of employment with the authority or the board, whether as a consultant, adviser or otherwise. Compliance with such codes of conduct will be a condition of employment of officers of planning authorities and employees of the board. I believe that this is the most appropriate way to ensure that conflicts of interest in the conduct of the business of the authority are minimised and I have no proposals to require PRSI numbers to be provided by architects or planning consultants with planning applications.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's query refers to correspondence dated 13 October 2000 from the Environmental Directorate of the European Commission. This provided an analysis of complaints received by the Commission from the public in Ireland and is part of an ongoing exchange of views with the Commission, which I initiated last year, in relation to implementation and enforcement of Community legislation in Ireland, including the handling of complaints received by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The correspondence recognised improvements made by Ireland in the implementation of Community directives and offered a number of observations on possibilities for reducing numbers of complaints and-or refining the roles of the relevant authorities involved. No suggestion that the Government was not co-operating adequately with the Commission on environmental issues was made.</P>
      <P>My Department has consulted with other Departments and agencies concerned and will be responding comprehensively to the Commission in the interests of timely, efficient and effective implementation of Community and national environmental legislation.</P>

      <P>Applications for approval of schemes under the serviced land initiative have been submitted by Westmeath County Council in respect of Kinnegad, Tyrellspass, Killucan and Rochfortbridge. The position in each case is as follows. The tenders for the Kinnegad sewerage scheme extension were approved in June 2000 and work is currently in progress. The estimated cost of the scheme is £1.4 million, 40% of which will be provided by the Department in accordance with the terms of the serviced land initiative. Proposals for sewerage schemes in the case of Tyrellspass and Killucan-Rathwire were submitted recently and are currently being examined in the Department. Estimated costs of the schemes are £0.93 million and £0.79 million, respectively. A proposal for a sewerage scheme for Rochfortbridge was submitted for consideration in an earlier round of the serviced land initiative but was not approved. No further proposal has been received from the council. No proposals under the serviced land initiative have been received for either Kilbeggan and Miltownpass. However, a sewerage scheme <Col N="549" /> to serve Miltownpass has been approved for construction under the rural towns and villages initiative. The submission of a revised preliminary report together with a current estimate of cost is awaited from the council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 851 and 852 together.</P>
      <P>The relevant regulations require that every lamp must be fitted and constructed so that it will not dazzle or mislead other traffic when lit. In addition, headlamps must be fitted with a dipping device such that the beam of light from the headlamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp and in a specified position, which approximates to that the driver of an oncoming vehicle. Dipped headlamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. Within this framework a maximum power rating is not specified for vehicle headlamps.</P>
      <P>Checks on headlamp condition and alignment are carried out as part of both the national car test and commercial vehicle testing scheme.</P>

      <P>Unless a person holds a full driving licence for category A &ndash; motorcycles of all sizes &ndash; or A1 &ndash; motorcycles not exceeding 125 cc, they must take out a provisional licence in the appropriate category in order to learn to drive a motorcycle and undergo the driving test.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 made a number of changes to the provisions governing the holding of driving licences for motorcycles, including the removal of restrictions by reference to an age limit of 25. Prior to the making of the new regulations, persons had either to have held a category A1 full licence for at least two years, or to be over 25 years of age, in order to be eligible to apply for a first-time category A provisional licence.</P>
      <P>The new regulations have relaxed access to first-time category A provisional licences by providing for eligibility of any person over 18 years of age. However all such persons, irrespective of age, are restricted to riding motorcycles not exceeding 25 kW engine power for the duration of all provisional licences granted to them and for the first two years after passing a driving test and taking out a full category A driving licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention behind these new provisions is that new motorcyclists will be restricted to riding and gaining experience on lower-powered motorcycles &ndash; less than 25kW engine power &ndash; before being given access to higher-powered machines. <Col N="551" /> These arrangements are considered desirable in the interests of road safety and against the background of the disproportionately high accident/fatality rate of motorcyclists in Ireland compared to other categories of road users. It should however be noted that these new arrangements do not apply to persons who held category A provisional licences prior to the commencement of the new regulations.</P>
    <P>These progression arrangements for new motorcyclists will be kept under review in the light of the motorcycle accident and fatality rate and the impact of the motorcycle training initiative being undertaken by MAG Ireland with support from my Department.</P>

      <P>A brief and a preliminary report for a proposed sewerage scheme at Belcarra, County Mayo, were submitted to my Department in 1992 and January 2000, respectively, but have not been approved. The scheme is seventeenth on the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Mayo County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-02 announced last July. Given the priority rating afforded to this scheme by the Council, the level of competing demands and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time. However, I understand that Mayo County Council is now proposing to advance the scheme under the devolved small schemes programme.</P>

      <P>I have not received an application from Wicklow County Council in this matter.</P>
      <P>Wicklow County Council was allocated non-national road grants of £6.39 million in 2000, an increase of 22% and 80% on the grant allocations for 1999 and 1997 respectively. In principle, the very considerable funds available to local authorities for non-national roads maintenance and improvement are designed to cover contingencies arising from flooding, storm damage and other severe weather conditions. My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads provides that the cost of remedial works necessitated by such conditions must be met from these resources and that local authorities should set aside contingency sums to finance these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also prepared to consider sympathetically any request from local authorities <Col N="553" /> to adjust their current multi-annual restoration programmes so as to prioritise works necessitated by flood damage to particular roads.</P>
    <P>I intend to announce non-national road grant allocations for 2001 very shortly.</P>

Funding is provided directly to local authorities and funding is also available from my Department under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme to assist the provision by voluntary housing bodies of accommodation of homeless persons.

      <P>Under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, up to 95% of the capital cost of providing accommodation for homeless persons, subject to certain overall unit cost limits is provided by my Department through the local authorities. The limits are £53,000 for one to two person units of accommodation and £63,000 in the case of family type accommodation. A higher level of assistance is available in the administrative areas of the county boroughs and the administrative counties of Fingal, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and South County Dublin at £75,000 for one to two person units of accommodation while the rate for family type accommodation is £90,000.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are empowered, under the Local Government Act 1994, to provide, operate and maintain parks and open spaces for amenity and recreational purposes. The criteria to be applied to the provision <Col N="554" /> of public open space in housing schemes are a matter for each local authority in accordance with its development plan. When deciding planning applications, a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities.</P>
      <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational and sports facilities and amenity areas specifically in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. Local authorities were advised in the new social housing design guidelines issued by my Department in September, 1999 that they should consider ways to facilitate and encourage the provision of services and amenities including parks, playing fields and recreational and leisure facilities. Appropriate facilities of this kind are, on a limited basis, funded as part of the cost of a new housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations.</P>
      <P>Funding is also available under my Department's remedial works scheme to assist housing authorities to carry out major essential works of a structural nature to dwellings in designated rundown housing estates. The objective is not only to upgrade the fabric of the dwellings but to improve the living conditions of the tenants. For this reason works of an environmental nature, including certain amenity and recreational facilities, may be included as part of a project where they are considered necessary to support the work undertaken to the dwellings.</P>

      <P>The employment disincentive problems associated with child dependant allowances were highlighted particularly in the report of the expert group on the Integration of tax and social welfare. Unlike CDAs, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test. The policy direction followed by successive Governments since 1994 has been, therefore, to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit, rather than increasing child dependant allowances, thus ensuring that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis </i>the employment status of the parent(s).</P>
      <P>This policy was given new impetus in this year's budget. The increases I announced in Budget 2001 constitute a full-year investment of £330 million in the child benefit scheme. Most notably, this is only the first of three years of increases which will see investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003, that is, almost a three fold increase. This will mean that by 2002, we will have exceeded the PPF commitment to move towards child benefit rates of £100 per month for third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>In view of this substantial shift away from CDAs and towards child benefit, I have no plans to increase CDAs for the group referred to by the Deputy, or indeed to CDAs generally.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy may be aware that currently, where a parent is receiving a pension or other long-term payment from my Department, CDAs are paid up to age 22 where the young person remains in full-time education.  In the case of short-term payments, CDAs are only paid up to the age of 18. There is a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to extend child dependant allowances to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 and in full-time education in the lifetime of the programme. This Government intends to fulfil that commitment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for an old age non-contributory pension in January 2000. His application was refused as his weekly means of £106.76 exceed the current statutory limit of £85.00. His means were derived <Col N="556" /> from income from a holding and the weekly value of capital under the legislation then applicable.</P>
      <P>The means of the person concerned were reviewed in the light of significant improvements affecting the assessment of capital which came into effect on 13 October 2000. His means, from that date, have been assessed at £85.42 a week entitling him to a pension of £5.50 per week. In addition he receives a living alone allowance of £6.00 and fuel allowance of £5.00 per week. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 872, 902 and 905 together.</P>
      <P>An insured person who is injured at work or who contracts a prescribed occupational disease may be entitled to benefits under the occupational injuries scheme. One of these is disablement benefit in respect of which claimants must be examined by a medical assessor of my Department to determine the degree of disablement that has resulted from the occupational injury or disease.</P>
      <P>In this case the person has been in receipt of disablement benefit following occupational accidents sustained in 1976 and 1981. Up to 1989 there were a number of reviews of his medical condition and in 1988 he was awarded a pension at the 30% rate for life.</P>
      <P>In March 1998 the person concerned sought a review of the assessed percentage loss of faculty on the grounds that his medical condition had worsened.</P>
      <P>The case was re-examined and the chief medical adviser, following which it was decided that the assessment of 30% loss of faculty was the appropriate assessment.</P>
      <P>An appeal was lodged against this decision and an oral hearing took place in May 2000. Following the hearing the appeals officer requested that an examination by an independent specialist consultant be arranged.</P>
      <P>An appointment has now been made and the person concerned has been notified.</P>
      <P>It is the practice of the social welfare appeals officer to advise appellants on the progress of their appeal from the initial acknowledgement of receipt of the appeal through to the notification of the outcome. In the case in question, where a final determination was not possible without further medical evidence, the person's legal representative was fully apprised of the position by the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my response to a parliamentary question of 6 December 2000, the application from community technical aid was referred to the standing operational committee of the community development programme for consideration of additional support structures, including specialist support <Col N="558" /> needs within the Department's programmes. As previously advised, the standing operational committee took the view that before individual proposals to provide technical assistance were considered, a strategic decision was required on whether or not such technical assistance was an identified need within the programme.</P>
      <P>The committee having deliberated on whether such technical assistance was deemed warranted, given the extensive support structures already provided for within the community development support programmes, then referred the matter to the national advisory committee for further consideration.</P>
      <P>The standing operational committee and the advisory committee are involved in a major review of programme structures at present and a decision regarding the need for additional support mechanisms within the programme is not envisaged for some time.</P>
      <P>The group referred to in the Deputy's question were advised of the situation at a meeting convened by my Department on 17 January 2001. They were also advised that should they wish to apply for funding as an individual group under my Department's community development support programmes, as opposed to becoming part of the support structures, that they could submit their application to the technical group for assessment.</P>
      <P>The technical group are an independent assessment group comprised of representatives from ADM, CPA, my Department and projects already funded under the community development support programmes. The function of this group is to assess applications from groups seeking inclusion in the community development support programmes and to advise me accordingly.</P>
      <P>The group submitted a revised application which was presented to the technical group for consideration on 25 January 2001. The technical group have made their recommendations to me on this and other applications considered by them. My Department will advise each applicant group of the outcome as soon as I have concluded my deliberations on the recommendations made to me by the technical group.</P>

      <P>Prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act 1998, child benefit was payable at the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth <Col N="559" /> of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>In fulfilment of our pre-election commitments, I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998 designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. Firstly, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. Secondly, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children.</P>
      <P>Both these measures took effect in September, 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million. I would not accept that the current arrangements are discriminatory against any particular family type. It is not the purpose of child benefit to cover the costs of child-rearing, rather to assist parents with such costs. The payment of child benefit at 150% of the normal rate in the case of twins and double the normal rate in the case of triplets, gives recognition within the child benefit scheme of the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them. The cost of providing for double child benefit payment for twins is estimated at some £10.2 million in a full year, based on the improved rates recently announced in Budget 2001.</P>

      <P>While there is now net migration into Ireland, a significant number of Irish people continue to leave each year. They include many qualified people, moving in search of other career options or to broaden their experiences, but also many who are less prepared and able to meet the challenges of settling in to a new environment and culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has provided funding for a number of years to emigrant advice, to help them develop and extend their services, particularly in the area of pre-departure information and advice. Last year, a grant of £20,000 was provided. Furthermore, I announced in Budget 2000 funding of £100,000 for the development of emigrant information and advice services, the primary purpose of which is to identify and respond to the information needs of Irish people living abroad and to improve access to pre-departure advice for others who may leave in the future. In this regard, grants were approved last year to the Emigrant Advice <Col N="560" /> Network, the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants and the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.</P>
    <P>Many young people travelling to major UK cities or to the USA remain at risk and there is a need to examine the availability, quality and effectiveness of pre-departure information and advice. Funding will be provided for essential research and for the support of pilot pre-departure advice projects.</P>
    <P>Seminars and consultation with a variety of organisations providing services to Irish communities in both the UK and the USA have indicated a clear need for better co-ordination and further development of information and advice services and improved methods of delivering and maintaining quality information to such organisations at local level. The development of information services, both in terms of pre-departure advice or supports for Irish people living abroad, will be undertaken in consultation with relevant organisations in both the statutory and non-statutory sectors. Key projects will include the provision of information to people returning to Ireland after periods spent living and working abroad.</P>
    <P>In 2000, I also launched the &ldquo;Returning to Ireland&rdquo; booklet which my Department put together for the purpose of providing a range of basic information covering matters such as housing and accommodation options, social welfare entitlements, health services and private health arrangements, education, and taxation for people who have emigrated and who are considering returning to Ireland. The booklet will also be of immense value to the wide range of organisations and centres working with the Irish community abroad.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 876, 879, 892, 897 and 903 together.</P>
      <P>A variety of travel concessions are granted by most EU member states to retired pensioners. The scope and value of these concession schemes vary widely from country to country. CIE participate in the Rail-Europe senior scheme which gives concessions to those aged over 60.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme, as in the case of other social welfare schemes in Ireland, is available to all eligible persons, residing in the State, irrespective of nationality. It would not be possible to extend the scheme solely to Irish nationals resident in Britain as this may be contrary to EU law, which in many instances prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality. This would mean, therefore, that if the scheme were to be extended on the lines suggested, it would have to be extended to all pensioners who are EU nationals coming to Ireland for temporary stays. This would, effectively, discriminate against all other Irish nationals resident in other countries throughout the world.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the issue of extending the free travel scheme to EU pensioners was examined in the review of the free schemes which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin in April last year.</P>
      <P>The review considered that the primary objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active within the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it concluded that extending the scheme to visitors would not be in keeping with the objective of the free travel scheme. It should also be noted that such an extension would have significant administrative and cost implications, of the order of £8 to £15 million, depending on the level of concession granted. The free travel scheme is based on spare capacity and CIE have already expressed their concern about capacity constraints on the public transport system. Therefore, it is unlikely they would grant any further extension of the scheme on the current concession basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the publication of the review, my officials re-examined the recommendation on EU travel and concurred with the conclusion in the review. It was also noted that the free travel scheme is but one element of a package of benefits provided to older people and people with dis<Col N="562" /> abilities in Ireland. Governments in other member states provide varying packages of benefits, including higher cash benefits combined with reduced travel concessions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the free travel scheme were extended to visitors coming to this country, they would benefit from whatever provision is made for travel in the package of benefits they receive from their country of residence and access to full free travel here. The effect of this would be to disadvantage Irish residents who cannot avail of free travel concessions in other EU countries, particularly when they visit relatives in the UK. Thus, they would be more disadvantaged in travel terms when they go abroad than the visitors who come here.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if Ireland were to unilaterally extend free travel to senior citizens visiting from abroad, it would be, in effect: discriminating against many other groups in our society who could receive great benefit from the scheme and could be considered to be in greater need; discriminating against those covered for free travel here, who are not eligible for free travel when they go abroad; and over compensating many of those receiving it whose package of benefits from their own country of residence would reflect local travel costs.</P>
    <P>It is considered that any bilateral or multi-lateral arrangement would need to have the following elements at least: reciprocity &ndash; travel concessions for eligible visitors coming to Ireland would have to be reciprocated in the case of eligible people from Ireland going abroad; appropriate identification procedures &ndash; some internationally recognised &ldquo;travel pass&rdquo; would have to be introduced, issued by the country of main residence, for identification purposes; cost sharing &ndash; arrangements for sharing the costs between countries would have to be worked out.</P>
    <P>Given the detailed arrangements required to set up such a scheme, which is outside the remit of my Department, it might be considered more appropriate for the EU who are examining a broad range of concessions for older people in the social, cultural and travel area.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published in April last year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. It considered that the main objective <Col N="563" /> of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care.</P>
    <P>The review noted that the free travel pass is granted to the qualifying person and not to his or her children or spouse. While a spouse, regardless of age, does benefit from being able to accompany the passholder, he or she is not a qualified person and has no underlying claim until he or she reaches the qualifying age. The fact that a spouse can accompany the pass holder is a positive aspect of the scheme, which should encourage greater mobility. To extend the scheme further to include children, at an estimated cost of £3 million, would appear to be excessive in view of the numbers and cost of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The review concluded that to extend the free travel scheme to such a group of people in their own right would be completely outside the objectives of the scheme and would discriminate against other groups such as single people, who cannot avail of the pass until reaching the qualifying age.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 878 and 916 together.</P>
      <P>The bereavement grant &ndash; formerly death grant &ndash; is a payment based on PRSI contributions, designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. The grant is payable on the death of an insured person; the wife or husband of an insured person; the widow or widower of an insured person; a child under age 18, or under age 22 if in full-time education &ndash; where either parent or the person that the child normally lives with satisfies the PRSI contribution conditions; a contributory pensioner; the wife or husband of a contributory pensioner; the qualified adult of a contributory pensioner, including those who would be a qualified adult but are getting another social welfare payment, e.g. carer's allowance; a qualified child; an orphan in receipt of orphan's (contributory) allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bereavement grant was totally redesigned in 1999 to provide for a five-fold increase in the rate of payment from £100 to the current rate of <Col N="564" /> £500. In addition, the payment was extended to include self-employed PRSI contributors and those covered by the modified rate of social insurance in addition to those paying full-rate PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>A person who has insufficient PRSI contributions will not qualify for a bereavement grant. However, there are other measures in place that are designed to assist people in the immediate aftermath of bereavement, for example, the payment of six weeks social welfare benefit following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse. Budget 2000 provided for the introduction of a once-off payment of £1,000 payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow(er's) contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the supplementary welfare allowance, a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his/her weekly income. These payments, known as exceptional needs payments, may be made towards funeral expenses where it is established that there is an inability to meet the costs by the family concerned.</P>
    <P>Any further developments in these arrangements would have expenditure implications and could only be considered in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 880, 901 and 922 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's website was launched in May 1996 and can be accessed at www.welfare.ie. The focus of the site is to provide up to date information directly to the public and in particular to groups and agencies, which provide information services to citizens. The information on the website includes details of schemes, entitlements, rates of payment, application forms, publications and locations for contacting the Department.</P>
      <P>The number of hits on the site in 2000 was 2,411,000. The website also provides the public with e-mail access to my Department. The e-mail address is info@welfare.ie.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks the level of e-mails received has risen and the Department is now receiving approximately 150 inquiries a week in this way, most of which are seeking information on the range of schemes operated by the Department. In the last quarter of 2000, 720 inquiries were received and all had received a response by 19 January 2001.</P>
      <P>The Department makes every effort to respond to these inquiries as quickly as possible. Queries of a general nature are responded to immediately while queries of a more specific nature are referred to the relevant area within my Department for a response.</P>
      <P>At the level of enquiries experienced to date it has in fact been possible to provide a response in the majority of cases within three days and every effort is made to clear the remaining enquiries speedily.</P>
      <P>Where the query requires the use of personal information in reply, the customer is asked for a postal address as it is current policy not to give personal information over the Internet. The majority of the queries received in practice, can be processed quickly over this medium.</P>
      <P>The departmental website is currently being redesigned and when the new version is launched it will be possible for customers to e-mail direct to the main scheme areas. In addition issues of security and individual authentication are being addressed under the umbrella of the REACH project and, when resolved, will increase the scope to use e-mail for transacting business with Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to combating social exclusion, ending marginalisation and creating a fairer society. Last <Col N="566" /> December's budget represented a further step towards achieving these goals.</P>
      <P>The most vulnerable in society, i.e. the young, the elderly and those dependant on social welfare, will all greatly benefit from the improvements announced.</P>
      <P>At £850 million, the social welfare budget allocation is the biggest ever and more than double last year's welfare package. This allocation will, to an unprecedented extent, direct the resources of the State at the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities.</P>
      <P>Among the most significant of these improvements are £25 and £30 increases in monthly child benefit for the lower and higher rates, respectively, with increases to be paid three months earlier from June next; £10 a week increase for single old age pensioners; up to £25 a week increase for pensioner couples (66 years and over); £12.90 special increase for contributory widows and widowers over 66 years; social welfare increases to be paid four weeks earlier from the first week in April; over 5,000 extra carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to benefit from improvement in the means test; entitlement to free schemes to be extended to everyone over 70 years of age regardless of household income or composition; special £10 per week islander allowance for pensioners over 66 years; additional four weeks maternity and adoptive benefits payments, with increases in minimum and maximum payments; fuel allowance paid for an additional three weeks, from early October to late April; living alone allowance of £6 to be paid to people under age 66 on invalidity pension, disability allowance, Unemployability supplement and blind person's pension.</P>
      <P>The significant improvements in the weekly rates of social welfare payments represent real increases of between 4.3% and 9.6% in personal rates and real increases of between 7.2% and 11.2% in the rates payable to couples.</P>
      <P>In addition to the improvements outlined above, the Government has also set targets in a number of key areas: to substantially increase child benefit by £1 billion over the next three years to assist families; to progressively increase payments for those on widows and widowers contributory pension aged 66 and over, up to the rate of old age contributory pension; to bring the payments for qualified adults (aged over 66) of contributory pensioners up to the old age non-contributory pension rate; to further improve the means test for the carer's allowance; and to pay general social welfare increases three months earlier, from the beginning of January 2002.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness also contains a commitment to make substantial progress over the period to 2003 towards a target rate of £100 per week for the lowest social welfare rates. The improvements provided in the recent budget fully comply with the PPF commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, as provided for in the PPF, a working group, which includes representatives of the various social partners, has been established to <Col N="567" /> examine the range of complex issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of adult and child social welfare payments. As part of its deliberations, the working group will be examining the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments, including their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns.</P>

      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium set a target old age pension rate of £100 by 2002. In the review of this programme, the Government committed to the early achievement of the £100 commitment and, furthermore, extended it to all social welfare old age pensions. We are well on the way to achieving this target with very significant increases granted over the last four budgets.</P>
      <P>The improvements announced in Budget 2001 will see the old age contributory pension increase to £106.00 per week, the old age non-contributory pension increase to £95.50 per week and the widow(er)'s contributory pension for someone over 66 years of age increase to £102 per week. Overall increases since 1997 amount to between £18 and £28 per week or 36% to 43%.</P>
      <P>As announced in Budget 2001, I intend to increase the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 or over, to same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. This will be done over a number of budgets. The increase of £15 per week announced in the budget is the first step in this process.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring the widest possible coverage for contributory pensions. In recent years more and more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme including a reduction in the average number of contributions required for pension purposes to ten. Arrangements were also introduced to cater for particular groups who would not otherwise qualify for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special old age contributory pension was introduced in April 1999 for those self employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group. These could not satisfy the basic requirement of having entered insurance ten years before pension age. The pension is paid to those who have at least five year's contributions <Col N="569" /> paid. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants.</P>
    <P>A special flat-rate old age contributory pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate was introduced for any person who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50% of the standard maximum rate. To qualify, a person must have paid at least 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-53 contributions or a combination of pre and post 1953 insurance. The new pension is payable from May 2000.</P>
    <P>Also in May 2000 I introduced significant improvements in the structure of the rates band under the old age contributory and retirement pensions which involved a reduction in the number of different rates payable. As a result all payments were reviewed and some 38,000 pensioners, who were on reduced rate old age contributory and retirement pensions saw their position improved.</P>
    <P>New arrangements for the assessment of capital for non-contributory pensions were also introduced. The first £10,000 of capital is now completely disregarded. Capital between £10,000 and £20,000 is assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, and capital above £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital. These limits are doubled in the case of a married couple. Also from October 2000, tapering of the qualified adult allowance was extended to recipients of the old age contributory and retirement pensions, to allow for an income range for a qualified adult of between £70 and £135.</P>
    <P>However, I recognise that more can be done in this area and in August 2000 I launched the report on Phase 1 of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This report identified the key issues in relation to qualification conditions. It also sets out suggested guiding principles and outlines a framework for reform.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations involves a change in the qualification conditions from the current one based on average contributions to a system based on the total number of contributions paid-credited over a persons working life. This represents a very significant change in approach for overall pensions policy. However, I feel that such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by the general public.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that the homemakers scheme, which is designed to help women who take time out of the paid workforce to care for children or sick relatives to qualify for a pension, be reviewed. Under the scheme, the time spent caring is disregarded when average contributions are being assessed for pension purposes. As outlined my budget speech, I am strongly <Col N="570" /> committed to converting the existing system of disregards into homemaker credits. I also believe that, in principle, the homemaker's scheme, which currently only operates from 1994, must be backdated.</P>
    <P>These issues will be considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualification conditions for pensions which will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements have also been made in the area of the free schemes. In October 2000, the free schemes were extended to all people over 75 years of age regardless of their income or household composition. The qualifying age is being further reduced to 70 years of age with effect from May 2001. Free electricity allowance and free TV licence schemes were also extended to qualified carers, with effect from October 2000. Another improvement announced in this year's budget is that payments under the free fuel scheme have been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001 and the next fuel season will start one week earlier in October 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 885 and 894 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories of people as possible. Much has been done in recent years to make qualification for pensions easier, particularly for those with reduced or interrupted social insurance records. In particular the average number of contributions required for a pension was reduced to ten in 1997, a special reduced pension was introduced in 1999 for self employed people who were already over 56 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group in 1988, and in Budget 2000 more recognition was afforded to pre-1953 contributions to help people <Col N="571" /> qualify for pensions who could not satisfy the average contributions test.</P>
    <P>However, I recognise that more can be done in this area and in August 2000 I launched the report on Phase 1 of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which was undertaken by my Department. This report identified the key issues in relation to qualification conditions. It also sets out suggested guiding principles and outlines a framework for reform.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations involves a change in the qualification conditions from the current one based on average contributions to a system based on the total number of contributions paid-credited over a persons working life. This represents a very significant change in approach for overall pensions policy. However, I feel that such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by the general public.</P>
    <P>The report also examined the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in 1994. Under this scheme periods spent caring for children or disabled relatives can be disregarded when a person's PRSI record is being assessed for old age contributory-retirement pension purposes. The review proposed that, in principle, the disregard approach should be replaced with one based on credited contributions. The operative date of the homemaker's scheme was also examined and it was considered that there is no fundamental reason, in principle, why the homemaker provisions should only apply from 1994; however, there are significant cost and operational issues to be considered.</P>
    <P>As outlined in my speech on the budget, I am strongly committed to implementing these proposals. Phase 2 of the review, which will get under way shortly, will consider the most appropriate way of achieving these. When implemented these measures should help many more people to qualify for pensions.</P>
    <P>The above deals with the more long-term needs of people, particularly those who take time out of the workforce to care for children or sick relatives. However, this Government is also committed to supporting parents in rearing their children. To this end, we provided for increases in child benefit of £25 per month for the first two children and £30 for the third and subsequent children in Budget 2001. This is only the first of three years of increases which will see Government investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003, that is almost a three fold increase. This means that by 2002, we will have exceeded the PPF commitment to move towards child benefit rates of £100 per month for third and subsequent children and delivered in full on our action programme commitment to put families at the centre of our policies.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is normally payable to the mother, recognising the important value of the work done by the primary carer, who is usually the mother. The major improvements provided <Col N="572" /> for in Budget 2001 will therefore strengthen the position of those who choose to work in the home and care for their children in that way, while simultaneously easing the burden for those who opt to work outside the home and use paid child care or informal child care arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 886, 899 and 927 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot, and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with this in mind that I have made a number of improvements to the carer's allowance scheme during my time in office, as follows. The carer's allowance has been increased by £28 per week (40%) for those over 66 and by £18 (26%) for those under 66 in the last four budgets. The increases announced in Budget 2001 will apply from April 2001. In addition carers in receipt of carer's allowance now qualify for the free schemes &ndash; a major additional benefit. The qualification conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly improved as follows: the residency qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been relaxed. This has introduced greater flexibility into the scheme, while still safeguarding <Col N="573" /> the needs and interests of the care recipients. This measure allows non-resident carers to be assessed on a case by case basis. The full-time care and attention rules were relaxed to allow carers to engage in part-time work, education or other activities. Carer's allowance was extended to children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and to all people between 16 and 65 who require full-time care and attention. The means test has been greatly improved over a number of budgets. An income disregard of £125, in the case of a single carer, and £250 in the case of a married couple, will apply from April 2001.</P>
    <P>This represents another move towards what I consider to be the optimum situation, which is that all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate. An annual respite care grant was introduced in 1999 and this will be increased to £400 from June 2001. In addition, from June 2001, carers caring for more than one person will receive a double respite care grant of £800. A new carer's benefit scheme was introduced on 26 October 2000. This new scheme provides financial support for 15 months to a person who gives up employment to care full-time. As it is based on a person's PRSI contributions there is no means test. My colleague, Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for Labour Affairs, is introducing carer's leave legislation to protect the employment rights of the carer during that 15 month period. The six weeks payment after death has been extended to carers whose spouse is not in receipt of a social welfare payment. The back to work allowance, back to education allowance and community employment scheme have been extended to carers when they cease caring. A project to examine issues relating to long-term care, both in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard has commenced.</P>
    <P>It is expected that this study will be completed by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>The many improvements I have introduced during the last four years have resulted in a large growth in expenditure on carer's allowance, from £36.5 million in 1997 to a projected £108.4 million this year, representing an increase of 197%.</P>
    <P>This has had a substantial impact on the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance, which has increased by more than 115 per cent since 1997 and now stands at almost 16,500. It is estimated that the recent increase in the means disregards will qualify an additional 5,000 carers for payment. These figures are a true reflection of the concern and commitment this Government has for carers and the appreciation we have for their valuable role in our society.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of paying the respite care grant with another social welfare pension, this grant is payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed rela<Col N="574" /> tives allowance to use in whatever way they choose. It is not possible to transfer additional benefits, such as the respite care grant between social welfare payments. However, a person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the payment most beneficial to him-her.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, addressed the issues of differing care needs and it proposed the introduction of a non-means tested 'continual care' payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>To differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the 'continual care' payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The many measures I have introduced for carers clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers and are a concrete expression of our appreciation for their valuable role in our society. Improvements have also been introduced by other Ministers covering their areas of responsibility and the position of carers in our society will be kept under review in a budgetary context across all relevant Departments in line with the Government's commitment to this group.</P>

      <P>In budget 2001 I announced increases of between £8 and £12.90 per week in the personal rates of various social welfare payments for widowed persons. From April 2001 the maximum rate of widow(er)'s contributory pension will be increased to £89.10 per week for a person under 66 years of age and to £102 for those over 66. The equivalent rates for the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension and the one-parent family payment will be £85.50 and £95.50 respectively. The Government is committed to the achievement of a rate of £100 per week <Col N="575" /> for all pensions paid in respect of people over 66 years of age by 2002.</P>
      <P>Child benefit will also increase from April 2001 by £25 per month for each of the first and second children and £30 per month for third and subsequent children. This will bring monthly child benefit payments to £67.50 and £86 respectively. These increases will be of major benefit to widows/ers with dependent children. In budget 2000 I also introduced a new scheme, the widowed parent's grant, to help with the special needs of this particular group in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement.</P>
      <P>This involves the payment of a special grant of £1,000 to a widow/er with dependent children in addition to the usual bereavement grant of £500 and other after death payments.</P>
      <P>Widow/ers will also benefit from changes I made in Budget 2001 in relation to the free schemes. Under the new arrangements all persons over 70 years of age will be entitled to the full range of schemes regardless of their means or household composition from May.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to social welfare provision for widowed people will be kept under review in the context of overall budgetary considerations.</P>

    <P>I am aware that the organisation has made a recent application in relation to multi-annual core funding to a number of Departments, including my own. In response to that application, officials from my Department recently met with the director of the organisation. In so far as my Department is concerned we will be considering the application in the context of available resources. These include the £2 million referred to in the question, which has been allocated across a number of Departments.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector, the criteria for this scheme will be decided in consultation with the implementation and advisory group. This group will be established shortly. These funds will be available in 2001 and I am happy to say that grant payments will be made this year. My Department will be in contact will the group in relation to the outcome of their application as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As outlined in the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector, the criteria for the scheme to support federations and networks will be decided in consultation with the implementation and advisory group. This group will be established shortly. These funds will be available in 2001 and I am <Col N="578" /> happy to say that grant payments will be made this year.</P>
      <P>My Department currently provides funding for training and support to the community and voluntary sector under a range of programmes. These include most notably the scheme of grants for community development education and training and the community development support programmes. The White Paper announced the Government's intention to establish an additional fund of £2 million to develop other support and training to the community and voluntary sector over the next two years.</P>
      <P>It is important that these extra resources are used to meet needs, which are not currently being met within existing programmes. The practical steps to ensure this need to be identified. To this end I plan to develop proposals over the next six months, in consultation with groups who will be affected, to provide for the effective and efficient implementation of this decision. Details of how and when this funding may be accessed will be then made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 896 and 924 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. Fuel allowances of £5 per week are paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones. The free schemes have a different aim. They are designed to provide additional assistance to people aged 66 or over, people with disabilities and carers who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are either living alone, or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition. In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Low income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type payment also qualify. The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension &ndash; currently £96 per week &ndash; plus any increases for dependants, plus £30. The national fuel scheme is a means-tested payment which is <Col N="579" /> not age-related. The fuel scheme is different in nature to the free schemes and, therefore, qualification conditions differ significantly. The standard rules for receipt of fuel allowances apply to people who are aged 70 years or more. It is estimated that it would cost an additional £32.4 million per year to extend the free fuel scheme to all persons over 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, I have introduced a series of improvements in the national fuel scheme over the last three years. I have extended the fuel season from 26 weeks to 29 weeks and I have eased the means test. The current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001 and the 2001-02 season will start one week earlier in October 2001. A substantial improvement in the means test was introduced by me in the 1999 budget. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings/investments of up to £30,000 over and above the maximum contributory pension rate and still qualify for fuel allowance. This income limit will be increased to £40 from October 2001.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre. Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment, ENP. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. I recognise the importance of fuel allowance to pensioners and I am also conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare system, whenever possible. However, the question of aligning the qualifying conditions for fuel allowance and free schemes has to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 904 and 933 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £18 million to this scheme, which to the end of 1999 had allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. While final figures are not yet available for 2000, it is estimated that a further 12,000 individuals were assisted under the scheme last year. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the purchase and/or installation cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems &ndash; such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist. Under the terms of the scheme, funding is available towards the once-off costs of obtaining or installing the relevant equipment. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers my Department has no role in setting or abolishing such fees. A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the reason some persons who enjoy the telephone rental allowance on grounds of age, and regardless of who lives with them, lose this entitlement when they enter long-stay nursing home care even where they continue to have a personal telephone account in their new accommodation; and if he will make provision to change the regulations to ensure that they continue to enjoy this benefit.</Quest>

      <P>The free schemes, including the free electricity-gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who meet the conditions of a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities <Col N="582" /> under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of free schemes retain that entitlement in order to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlement following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>From October 2000, the free schemes including the free telephone rental allowance, were extended to all persons aged 75 and over, regardless of their income and household composition. Provision was made in Budget 2001 to extend further the free schemes to all persons aged 70 years and over from May 2001.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, in April 2000, noted that the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as follows: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; support government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society. Any further changes in the arrangements for the free telephone rental allowance would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. SWA is not ordinarily payable to people in full time employment. However, arrangements have been in place since 1994 to enable rent and mortgage interest supplement recipients to retain their supplement as an in-work benefit on taking up employment, subject to certain conditions. One of the conditions is that household income must not exceed £250 per week. PRSI and any reasonable travelling expenses are disregarded in the means test.</P>
      <P>The income test has not remained unchanged since these arrangements were introduced in 1994. This issue was examined in the context of the Government's commitment under Partnership 2000 to consider a tapering arrangement for SWA housing supplements, in consultation with the social partners. Arising from this, the means test was eased with effect from 6 April 2000, with back to work allowance, BTWA, and family income supplement, FIS, now disregarded in the assessment of means for the £250 household income limit. This represents quite a substantial easing of the income test.</P>
      <P>This matter will again be examined later this year as part of the fundamental review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has already been established to carry out this wide ranging review. Any proposals for changes in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

The main objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, this is taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers in direct provision who are being provided with full board accommodation, all meals and other services. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
      <P>A person who leaves direct provision accommodation without clear justification and who subsequently applies for rent supplement or assistance towards a rent deposit is regarded as not having an accommodation need and rent supplements are not payable. The rate of SWA payable in such cases is the same as that payable to people in direct provision. However, a health board may decide in exceptional cases to award a rent supplement due to particular circumstances. Deciding entitlement to SWA payments is a matter for the relevant health board and my Department has no function in that regard. The person concerned is an asylum seeker who was in direct provision in Rathdrum, County Wicklow. He moved to Dublin and has been granted refugee status from 18 January 2001. This entitles him to claim full rate SWA and accordingly he is being paid a basic SWA payment and rent supplement from that date.</P>

      <P>Table 1 which follows details the projected number of persons aged 65 and over during the period 2000 to 2011. Table 2 outlines the number of persons in receipt of old age contributory pension retirement pension and old age pension in April 2000 as well as the projected number of recipients of these payments over the period to 2011. It should be noted that both old age contributory pension and old age pension are payable from aged 66 while retirement pension is payable from age 65. Table 3 shows the number of recipients of all social welfare weekly payments made to persons aged 66 or over.</P>
      <P>Data are not available on the number of former civil and public servants who do not qualify for a contributory or non-contributory old age pension. There are a number of reasons as to why persons aged 66 and over may not be in receipt of a social welfare pension in their own right. Some, including most public servants, will not have been covered for certain contributory pensions during their working lifetime. Others may not have been covered by the social insurance system at all during their lifetime or have insufficient contributions to qualify for a payment. This group includes, for example, many former self-employed persons who retired before social insurance for the self-employed was introduced in 1988. All persons who do not qualify for a contributory pension are eligible to apply for an old age non-contributory pension which is subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>All civil and public servants recruited since April 1995 pay PRSI at the full employee rate and are covered for all benefits and pensions. The number of civil and public servants who pay social insurance at the modified rate will decline in the years ahead as individuals retire or resign from the service. The projected number of modified contributors over the period 2001 to 2046 is illustrated in table 4 below.</P>

      <P>Some 890,000 payments covering nearly 1.5 million people are issued each week by my Department to claimants under a wide variety of schemes. These payments are paid mainly by cheque or payable order and my Department does not have direct contact with the payees on any systematic basis. Many customers initiate contact with the Department for information or in relation to changes in their circumstances. Contact initiated by the Department would be with a view to ensuring that the conditions for entitlement to payment continue to be met or where it was considered that the person might have an entitlement under another scheme, to inform and advise them accordingly.</P>
      <P>The close monitoring of claimants on a basis which would allow it to detect rate and isolated incidents is not something which would be possible in the context of a highly dynamic operation, carried out significantly by telephone, correspondence, third parties and in such volumes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it is considered that the needs of the people concerned might be appropriately addressed by another State agency the persons are referred to that agency. Where the situation appears to warrant it, contact will be made by officials with any other agency on behalf of any <Col N="588" /> person who is thought to need the intervention of that agency but is unlikely to or incapable of initiating action themselves.</P>
    <P>The inquiries made by an inspector of the Department in this case arose in the course of a routine review of the entitlements of the people concerned. These inquiries were carried out in the normal way appropriate to such cases. It is not clear what practical action could be taken by State agencies as a matter of routine which would avert the sort of tragic events which took place in this case.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a standard rate old age contributory pension is that a person must have a yearly average of at least ten social insurance contributions recorded. The yearly average is calculated over the period from 1953, or date of entry into insurance, if later, up to the end of the last full contribution year before reaching pension age &ndash; 66 years.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has contributions recorded over the period 1953 to 1957 during which a total of 189 contributions are recorded. This results in a yearly average of four. Her claim to old age contributory pension was, therefore, disallowed and she was notified accordingly. The question as to whether or not the person concerned was insurable under social welfare legislation for the period 1988 to 1998 while she assisted her husband in the running of his business has been raised.</P>
      <P>A deciding officer has decided that she was not insurable under social welfare legislation for the period concerned. If she is dissatisfied with this decision, it is open to her to appeal against it to the social welfare appeals office. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The transfer arrangements in respect of civil servants in the clerical grades who wish to move from Dublin to provincial locations are provided for by way of a central agreement between the Department of Finance and the staff union concerned. A formal arrangement was drawn up during 2000 in respect of civil servants in the grade of staff officer who wish to move from one location to another. Details of the numbers of the clerical officers and staff officers who have applied to my Department for transfer to locations outside of Dublin are furnished in the attached tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> These transfer lists are updated only whenever vacancies in the grade arise to be filled in the location concerned. Accordingly, the numbers of clerical officers on the transfer lists for some locations may not reflect the numbers of staff at present who would be available for relocation if this were to be offered. Furthermore, quite frequently, a person applying for transfer would indicate interest in several locations in the county or general region. There are no formal transfer arrangements in place for other general service grades. Where staff in these grades indicate interest in relocating, they are accommodated whenever possible.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who is a farmer, applied for a carer's allowance on 4 February 1999. He was refused on the grounds that he was not in a position to provide the full-time care and attention to the pensioner involved. He was notified of this decision, the reasons for it and of his right of appeal on 8 April 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, certain budgetary changes have been made by me since then. Accordingly in order to establish whether he now has an entitlement to carer's allowance his case has been referred to an investigative officer of my Department for a means assessment and to establish whether the conditions for receipt of the allowance are fulfilled. His entitlement will be further examined in the light of the investigative officer's report.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of a widow's contributory pension since February 1983. It is currently payable at the maximum rate of £89.10 a week. Entitlement is based on the social insurance record of her late husband. She is also getting a fuel allowance of £5.00 a week. The person concerned would not be financially better off claiming old age non-contributory pension as the current maximum rate of this pension, £85.50, is less than the maximum rate of widow's contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of old age contributory pension, entitlement is based on a person's own social insurance record. The person concerned has not claimed old age contributory pension to date. According to my Department's records, she was <Col N="593" /> insurably employed intermittently over the period 1975 to 1991 but does not have sufficient contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension. If she would like a formal decision on her entitlement, she should apply by completing the relevant pension claim form and sending it to my Department.</P>

Following a review of her entitlement, her means were found to have increased and her rate of payment was reduced accordingly to £57.50 per week.

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability.</P>
      <P>The policy direction over recent years has been to concentrate resources on improving child benefit &ndash; CB &ndash; for all families. Since I came into office I have increased the lower rate of CB from £30 to £42.50 per month, and the higher rate from £39 to £56 per month. The increases I recently announced in Budget 2001 will raise child benefit to £67.50 per month for the first two children and £86 per month for the third and subsequent children from June 2001. Most notably, this is only the first of three years of increases which will see Government investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003, which is almost a threefold increase. Any proposals to extend child benefit entitlement to all students up to the age of 22 and in full-time education would be costly and would have to be considered in the light of available resources and overall budgetary priorities.</P>

      <P>The conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance require, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work. In order to satisfy these conditions a person must demonstrate that he or she is making reasonable efforts to secure suitable full-time employment or self-employment. A person who leaves existing employment, whether to work full-time in the home caring for children or otherwise would, in the normal course, not be deemed to satisfy the conditions for receipt of an unemployment payment.</P>
      <P>The application of the rules governing entitlement to unemployment payments in particular types of work situations is under review at present but there are no plans to alter these fundamental conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. A person who spends time out of the workforce either to care for children up to 12 years of age or for an incapacitated person, may avail of the homemakers scheme under which period spent caring for children or incapacitated persons may be disregarded in calculating a person's old age contributory pension entitlements. Up to 20 years may be disregarded in this (reply appeals incomplete).</P>

      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has a £5 million annual allocation to support the provision of out of school hours child care services by community based groups in disadvantaged areas. The £5 million annual funding for the out of school <Col N="596" /> hours child care scheme will be made available to the projects funded by my Department under the following programmes: the community development programme; the family and community services resource centre programme; and the core-funded community and family support group programme. Funding will also be available to other local initiatives subscribing to a self-help, community development ethos.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the provision of this funding to less well off communities will address a number of issues, for example, the provision of low cost out of school child care for parents who are in the paid labour market, practical support for children who need additional support to maintain their interest in school, the promotion of parental and community involvement in engaging young people in school and community life and the provision of additional community based services for families.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department allocated funding of £1.5 million to community based groups in respect of their out of school hours child care services projects. Full details of the amounts paid to projects in 2000 will be available shortly in the Dáil Library for the information of Members.</P>

      <P>The existing school building, together with adjoining residence, which dates from the 1840s, is an elegant single-storey protected structure and is the only known school in Ireland of its type designed by Decimus Burton, the famous English landscape architect, whose involvement in the Phoenix Park for nearly two decades from 1845 probably represented the greatest period of landscape change since the park's creation.</P>
      <P>The plans submitted by the Department of Education and Science provided for a large two-storey extension which would not only detract from the architectural integrity of the building but would also be out of harmony among the park lodges in the vicinity.

This study examined the provision of modern telecom services to the Gaeltacht and the Islands and was funded by both Údarás na Gaeltachta and my Department. The report of the study is being actively considered and it is not intended to publish the report as some of the subject matter is considered to be strategically and commercially sensitive.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan I propose to carry out the following works at the sites referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Bective Abbey, County Meath.</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>I propose providing a reception building, public toilets and a car park. To allow this project to proceed a land purchase is required. Early progress is therefore dependent on concluding a successful purchase and the receipt of planning permission. Subject to the foregoing I would expect work at the site to get under way during 2002 and to be completed during 2004.</P>

      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>I intend undertaking essential conservation works at this site. However, before these works can be commenced it will be necessary to transfer the property from the current owner to my Department. Discussions in this regard have been ongoing for some time. Subject to a successful transfer of the lands in question, I expect the conservation works to commence during 2002 and to be completed before the end of 2003.</P>

    <P>
      <i>
      </i>At present my Department is formulating a brief in relation to the development of Trim Town Hall, having regard to the needs of the adjoining Trim Castle. In this context it will be necessary to assess the requirements for the presentation of the castle over a number of seasons. Detailed planning for the Trim Town Hall project should commence during late 2002. This timeframe will allow works on site to start during 2003. In the meantime work is continuing on the <Col N="602" /> landscaping of Trim Castle and I expect this element of the project to be completed during 2001.</P>

      <P>My Department provides compensation to landowners for actual income losses arising from any restrictions needed to maintain the favourable conservation status of land included in special areas of conservation and special protection areas.</P>
      <P>My Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, successfully completed negotiations on prescriptions for Burren habitats blanket bogs, heaths, upland grassland, sand dunes and machair. A number of other habitat &ndash; including callows &ndash; prescriptions have yet to be agreed. Until prescriptions are agreed for the callows, no general restrictions will be imposed and the consequential need for compensation will not arise.</P>
      <P>Officials of both Departments have met organisations representing the Shannon callows farmers on numerous occasions over the past few years. At a meeting held in February 2000, agreement in principle was reached on the prescriptions which would be applied to the Shannon callows and other similar type lands. It was also agreed to prepare a number of farm plans on a pilot basis. These plans would apply the prescriptions and indicate the financial implications arising on the sample farms and therefore the appropriate compensation in those cases. It was envisaged that a further meeting would take place once the plans were completed at which any necessary refinement of the prescriptions in the light of the results could be discussed. Unfortunately the farmers subsequently refused permission to have the plans prepared on their lands.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances both Departments are now giving priority to negotiating prescriptions for other habitats not previously addressed, rather than devoting further time, at this stage, to fruitless discussions on the callows.</P>

      <P>The Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, provides for the regulation of coursing by greyhounds and designates the Irish Coursing Club as the controlling body for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds. The enforcement of this act is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>Licences are issued by Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, under sections 32 and 34 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, which enables the Irish Coursing Club and its affiliated clubs to net and earmark hares which are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976. As part of their duties conservation rangers carry out spot checks on coursing club meetings to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions attached to the licences.</P>
      <P>Two conservation rangers from Dúchas attended the coursing meeting at Abbeyfeale. I understand that the meeting was abandoned by the club after the first day due to the poor quality of the hares present. There do not appear to have been any breaches of the Wildlife Act, 1976. A detailed report on the meeting has been requested from the ranger staff present and will be examined when received.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the correct payment was made in respect of the year 2000. Unfortunately, the person involved was overpaid in 1999. Based on the information supplied by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the overpayment amounted to £429. It arose from the fact that although this individual had a permanent quota of one hundred and sixty six in 1998, and was paid on this basis, in fact he only claimed for one hundred and fifty ewes. Compensation for his losses should have been based on this lower figure. I am considering how best to deal with the over-payment in this case.</P>

      <P>There has been no change in my Department's position on turf cutting on designated bogs. Please see attached copies of press releases that outline the options available to turf cutters This has been the position since early 1999.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, under which the restrictions on turf cutting in certain areas arise, and the Wildlife Act, 1976, are implemented principally by 116 national parks and wildlife field staff attached to Dúchas &ndash; the heritage services division of my Department &ndash; as part of their overall responsibilities. The payroll cost of these staff is estimated at £2.6 million per annum. It is not possible to estimate how much of this overall cost is attributable to the policing of the prohibition of turf-cutting on designated bogs.</P>

      <P>A research programme, involving a wide range of scientific disciplines, was carried out by Dúchas, the heritage services division of my Department, on designated bogs in County Offaly. This programme, which began in 1989, was undertaken in association with the Geological Survey of Ireland, Irish and Dutch universities and the Netherlands statutory conservation body, Staatsbosbeheer. The work carried out demonstrated that all types of turf cutting and their associated drainage systems are incompatible with the protection of the nature conservation value of these bogs. It has been established that turf cutting not only damages the conservation value of the immediate area of bog used but also can cause widespread adverse impacts up to 500 meters away from the site of the turf cutting It is for this reason that Dúchas wishes to <Col N="607" /> phase out turf cutting on areas of bog that are required to be protected under the EU habitats directive.</P>
      <P>Based on the information gathered in the aforementioned research programme, surveyors have carried out investigations of selected bogs throughout the country, including Roscommon and Galway. These investigations confirmed that the research results from the County Offaly bogs were applicable to bogs of scientific interest elsewhere in the country. As a result of such surveys a selection of bogs has been proposed for SAC designation under the habitats directive. Financial incentives (compensation) have been put in place to encourage the cessation of turf cutting in these most sensitive areas with other options being to transfer turf cutting to adjacent non designated sites &ndash; where such sites can be found &ndash; or, in certain circumstances, where the scientific assessment is favourable, to continue domestic cutting for a limited period of time.</P>

      <P>The Tralee Ship Canal restoration project has largely been completed, following the dredging of the main channel, the installation of the swing bridge at Blennerville and the completion of the basin works. As previously indicated, the final phase of the works will include the restoration of the lock gates, the installation of navigational aids and the completion of some minor dredging works. It is expected that these works will be completed this year. The lock chamber has been surveyed with a view to establishing the precise requirements <Col N="608" /> necessary to undertake the repairs and installation of the lock gates. However, in view of the specialist nature of these works a completion date has not yet been determined.</P>
      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that a meeting was held last year between officials of my Department, the Office of Public Works and Tralee UDC, and it was agreed that the local authority will take over the future maintenance and operation of the Tralee Ship Canal. However, it should be noted that there are no plans to provide a marina facility at the basin under the present proposals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 977, 978, 979, 992, 993, 997, 999, 1016 and 1020 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to outline the position in relation to the implementation of the increases in maternity and adoptive leave announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, an extension of four weeks to the period of maternity leave, which attracts a payment, increasing the entitlement from 14 to 18 weeks and an extension of four weeks to unpaid maternity leave increasing the entitlement from four to eight weeks was announced in budget 2001. In accordance with the budget announcement, the increase in maternity leave, attracting a payment, will be applicable to women commencing maternity leave on or after 2 April 2001. This date is in line with the introduction of other social welfare increases announced in the budget. However, in order to give people the maximum possible benefit from the proposed extension of maternity leave, I, together with my colleagues the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs, intend to have the extension of the duration of maternity leave introduced at the earliest possible date which complies with the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to provide for the increased entitlements to maternity leave it is necessary to amend the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, by means of <Col N="615" /> an order under that Act. The order requires a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The timing of the making of the order will depend on the completion of the drafting of the order and compliance with the necessary Oireachtas procedures. The order is being finalised at present by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office. I would like to assure all Deputies that this work is being afforded the utmost priority.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have the order in place when a woman is giving the statutory minimum four weeks notice to her employer of going on maternity leave, in order to comply with the notice requirements laid down in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994. The entitlement to the extra paid maternity leave will therefore apply to women who can comply with this four-week notification requirement. It is not possible to backdate the entitlement to people already on maternity leave, as this would mean that the order would have retrospective application which is not permissible under the Act.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the unpaid maternity leave is different. As the notice requirements under the Maternity Protection Act are different for unpaid leave than paid maternity leave, it will be possible to bring in the entitlement to the extra four weeks unpaid leave for any woman who has four weeks or more of her paid maternity leave left on the date on which the order is made.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by officials in the immigration and citizenship division of my Department that, despite an extensive search, there is no record of an application for citizenship having been received from the person referred to. officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, who process applications for post-nuptial citizenship from persons residing outside the State, have confirmed that there is no record of an application having been received in that Department. In any event, it would appear from the information supplied by the Deputy that the person referred to did not meet the statutory requirement of being married to an Irish citizen for three years in January 1998, when the application is stated to have been submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to the person concerned to submit an application at any time provided, of course, she meets the statutory requirements at the time of application. In order to uphold the integrity of Irish citizenship, my officials must ensure, as far <Col N="619" /> as possible, that applicants for Irish citizenship are entitled to it and it will, therefore, be necessary for the person referred to supply the usual original documentation with her application. Applications for citizenship are dealt with in chronological order as this method is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.</P>

      <P>There is no probation and welfare officer assigned to Cloverhill remand prison at present due to staff shortages. It should be noted, however, that where reports are requested by the courts in relation to prisoners in custody in Cloverhill remand prison, such reports are undertaken by a probation and welfare officer assigned to the local area where the prisoner resides.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by my Department to address the question of vacancies. The Civil Service Commission recently held a recruitment campaign to fill both existing vacancies and newly sanctioned posts in the probation and welfare service and offers of appointment are currently in the process of being made to successful candidates. In addition, my Department have, in the last week, advertised for the recruitment of 25 additional full-time temporary unestablished positions of probation and welfare officer. Assignments to fill vacancies in the service will be made as candidates from both these competitions take up duty in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that recruitment will continue until all vacancies and the new posts in the service have been filled. My Department is also working to heighten the profile of the Probation and Welfare Service as a career option for social work graduates and in this regard will be availing of the Opportunities 2001 recruitment fair at the RDS from 3 to 6 February 2001 to promote the service to graduates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 998 and 1,063 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy in relation to e-mail is that it is treated in the same manner as any other means of communication with the Department e.g. letter, fax, telephone etc. Under my Department's customer service action plan, the Department is committed to working towards issuing replies to queries within 20 working days where possible. In some cases, it is not possible to comply with this guideline where, for example, substantial research into or examination of issues is required. There is no distinction drawn between e-mail and any other method of communication in this regard: it must be opened, read, evaluated and responded to within the timelines set out in the Department's customer service plan.</P>
      <P>With regard to the contact address for my Department and the method by which e-mail is dealt with on arrival including the systems and procedures in place, the position is as follows. There are a number of e-mail addresses on the Department's website. In addition to a general contact address (info@justice.ie), there is a separate e-mail address for each of the major work areas of the Department:</P>
      <P>Citizenship;</P>
      <P>Courts;</P>
      <P>Law Reform (Criminal);</P>
      <P>Law Reform (Civil);</P>
      <P>Equality Matters;</P>
      <P>EU Matters;</P>
      <P>Garda Síochána (Administration);</P>
      <P>Immigration;</P>
      <P>Minister;</P>
      <P>Minister of State;</P>
      <P>Press Office (Department Press Office);</P>
      <P>Prisons and Places of Detention;</P>
      <P>Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
      <P>When a topic or document of particular interest is published on the site, or it is expected that interested parties will wish to make requests, observations and submissions on a particular issue of public interest, additional e-mails contact addresses are created &ndash; these will often be placed on the website for a defined period of time. The rationale behind this structure is as follows: </P>
      <P>(a)It is more customer focused as the sender is aware they are sending their query to a specific division or submitting requests-material etc. to an address specifically created for that purpose,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)once e-mail is received in the Department it is automatically routed to the area concerned thus ensuring that e-mails are not stored for distribution and reducing the <Col N="623" /> risk of e-mail being sent to an incorrect area, and</P>
    <P>(c)e-mail is not addressed to an individual from the web-site thus reducing the difficulties caused by staff changes or mail residing in incoming mail boxes if an individual is not available.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above website based structure, all staff in the Department have individual e-mail addresses and large volumes of e-mails are sent and received and no distinction is drawn with regard to processing requirement between mails received directly and those received via the website. E-mails entering the Department arise for a number of reasons, for example requests for information, replies to requests from departmental staff, material transmitted between State offices etc. The policy is that e-mails received in this way should be forwarded to the appropriate mail-enabled document library for whatever action is necessary, thereby joining the mainstream of documents and correspondence being dealt with by the Department. My Department has a project under way to blend incoming paper correspondence with the electronic filing systems.</P>
    <P>In addition, limited use of personal e-mail is allowed. Finally, as with all organisations or individuals using e-mail the Department receives large numbers of unsolicited junk e-mail, mail containing viruses &ndash; which are blocked and do not enter the system. For these reasons and because of the way incoming e-mails are automatically routed as outlined above, the information sought in respect of the numbers of pieces of e-mail coming in and the response rate cannot be compiled.</P>
    <P>There is one exception to the acceptance of e-mails, that is, when it is necessary to have a document signed or verified by the sender. In these circumstances ordinary e-mail does not yet have equivalence with other forms of signature. In this regard my Department is actively participating in various electronic Government projects to promote the use of secure digital signatures as a means of identification for transactions, notably the e-broker project approved by Government last year. There is no doubt that e-mail is becoming an increasingly important means of contact between my Department and its clients. My Department regularly reviews emerging technologies in the area to ensure that any benefits both from a customer service perspective and administrative efficiency are taken on board.</P>

The local chief superintendent will have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the CCTV system in his-her particular area. The composition of this committee will include representatives of the following: Garda telecommunications section who will project manage the technical aspects of the system; local crime prevention officers; ESB; local authority; Office of Public Works and local business interests.</P>

      <P>The role of my Department in relation to child care relates to services provided by third parties to parents for the care of their children. The findings of a survey conducted in 1998 by the ESRI on behalf of the Commission on the Family indicate that one in five households with children aged four years or less use the services of a crèche-nursery and that in almost half of these households the mother worked full-time in the home, suggesting a desire on the part of those mothers working full time in the home for their children to participate in pre-school services. My Department has been supporting the development of child care service provision, including pre-school services, since 1994 from a social inclusion and equal opportunities perspective.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, prohibits discrimination in relation to employment, including, access to employment, on nine grounds, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Act should facilitate women who give up their employment to care for their children full time in the home and who wish at a later stage to return to paid employment. In particular, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of age will ensure that such women will have the option of re-entering the labour force once they have reared their children.</P>
      <P>Funding provided in the national development plan for my Department for positive action for women includes an element for projects which assist women returning to the labour force after long absences rearing their children. These initiatives are complemented by work being done by my colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has introduced the home carers allowance which is a new tax allowance of up to £3,000 per annum at the standard <Col N="626" /> rate of income tax. This may be claimed by married couples, who are jointly assessed and where one spouse, the home carer, cares for one or more dependent persons which includes children, the aged or incapacitated persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is currently undertaking a review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. The second phase of this review, which is due to commence shortly, will further examine the existing arrangements for the homemakers scheme whereby special arrangements are currently in place to help people who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Increases in child benefit were announced in the budget which will benefit all women irrespective of whether they are working in the home or otherwise. The increases in child benefit are illustrated in the following table: </P>

    <P>These increases are due to take effect from 5 June 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department recently completed a review of maternity protection legislation in consultation with other relevant Government Departments and the social partners, and in accordance with commitments in the Government Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The report of the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation has been accepted by the Government and presented to the social partners under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It will be published shortly. The working group agreed recommendations to improve maternity protection provision, including the increase, as announced in the budget, in the period of maternity leave, attracting payment from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and in the period of optional (unpaid) leave from four weeks to eight weeks. The recommendations of the working group will significantly improve conditions for mothers who wish to remain full time at home with new-born babies.</P>
    <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, provides an individual and non-transferrable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The leave must be taken before the child reaches five years of age, except in certain circumstances in the case of an adopted child. This legislation will facilitate both <Col N="627" /> parents to dedicate a short period to the full time care of young children. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness my Department will, in 2001, conduct a review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may like to be aware that my Department allocated a grant of £5,000 last year to the organisation Women in the Home for development activities and this grant is being increased to £6,000 this year. In addition, funding was provided last year towards the attendance of a representative of Women in the Home at the UN General Assembly Special Session Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century (Beijing + 5). Women in the Home aims to provide support and a forum for women working in the home through which they can have a voice and influence society.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century' which took place in New York in June of last year to mark five years since the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, my Department has started work on the development of a national plan for women. My Department will enter into a consultation process with women and their representative groups when a draft plan currently being developed in my Department becomes available. This will provide an opportunity for women working full time in the home to contribute to the development of the national plan for women.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been allocated £250 million over the course of the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 to improve child care provision throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis.</P>
      <P>On the 28 April 2000, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for community based/not-for-profit child care organisations and capital grants for small scale private child care providers catering for no more than 20 children to enable us to meet these objectives. Grants are also available for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, child care training and innovative projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the funding available under the national development plan, in October 2000, I announced details of the Government's extra £40 million anti-inflationary package for child care. <Col N="628" /> Following on from this announcement, in late November, 2000, I was pleased to announce the availability of capital grants, from my Department's equal opportunities child care section, to private child care providers who cater for more than 20 children.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of the availability of grants in April 2000, over £30 million in funding has been committed by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme with over £22 million being allocated in the form of capital or staffing grants to child care services on the ground. Almost 7,000 child care places will be supported by the funding committed by my Department which includes the creation of over 3,200 new child care places.</P>
    <P>Budget 2001 saw the greatest increase in child benefit by any Government in the history of the State with an increase in child benefit rates, from June 2001, by £25 per month for first and second children to £67.50 per month and for the third and subsequent children by £30 per month to £86 per month. Similar child benefit increases will be paid in 2002 and 2003, bringing the rates to £117.50 and £146 per month respectively. These increases will initially cost £192 million and will cost £329 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The measures in place, as outlined above, together with the increase in child benefit rates announced in budget 2001, reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have any plans to introduce legislation which would make it mandatory for employers to pay women while on maternity leave. However, while there is no statutory obligation on employers to pay employees their full salary while on maternity leave, most public service employers and some private sector employers do opt to pay full salary to their employees while on maternity leave. This is similar to the situation in relation to sick leave, where some employees may claim benefit from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, while some employers operate sick pay schemes for their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my Department recently completed a review of maternity protection legislation in consultation with other relevant Government Departments and the social partners and in accordance with commitments in the Government Action Programme for the Mil<Col N="629" /> lennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The report of the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation has been accepted by the Government and presented to the social partners under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It will be published shortly. The working group agreed recommendations to improve maternity protection provision, including the increase, as announced in the budget, in the period of maternity leave (attracting payment) from 14 weeks to 18 weeks; and to increase the period of optional additional unpaid leave from four weeks to eight weeks. The recommendations of the working group will significantly improve conditions for expectant and new mothers in the workforce.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, provides that, when a woman is on maternity leave under section 8 of the Act, all rights associated with her employment are protected, except the right to remuneration. The period of maternity leave under section 8 of the Act attracts a payment (maternity benefit) from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, subject to the applicant complying with certain qualifying conditions. Section 14 of the Act provides for &ldquo;additional maternity leave&rdquo; which is unpaid.</P>
    <P>In the civil and public service, most employees are paid full salary by their employer. Public Service employers may recoup maternity benefit from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in the case of employees who are fully insured for PRSI purposes.</P>
    <P>In the private sector, some employers may opt to top up the payment which their employees receive from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which effectively means that the employees are paid their full salary.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the current buoyancy in the economy, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds continues to grow at an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels.  The total intake of new cases for the year 2000 amounted to 161,844. This represents an increase of 29,485 over the 1999 intake.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increase in property transactions, major infrastructural projects undertaken by the bodies responsible for systems and utilities e.g. Bord Gáis, ESB, Coillte, National Roads Authority, Bord na Móna etc. have also placed considerable strain on the Registry's ability to provide essential services.  In the circumstances, the staff in the Land Registry have worked very hard to give the best possible service to their customers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> The Deputy will be aware that, in order to address this problem, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing compliment of the Land Registry by 77. The resultant appointments are currently being made following a recruitment drive by the Civil Service Commission which is now beginning to pay dividends.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems which have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management are implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation. These include improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will improve shortly.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State on 4 April 1998 and applied for asylum the next day. He was scheduled to be interviewed on 13 July 1998 but he did not attend. He contacted the Department again on 26 November 1998 and was interviewed on 22 January 1999. His application was refused and a letter to this effect issued on 30 June 1999. He did not avail of an opportunity to appeal this decision. On 16 November 1999 he was requested to present himself to the garda in charge, Immigration Registration Office, Harcourt Square, on 25 November 1999 to enable his deportation to take place, but he failed to keep this appointment. Failure to present oneself at a particular time and place for the purpose of giving effect to a deportation order renders a person liable to arrest and detention under the provisions of section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person referred to was arrested at 8.10 p.m. on 2 January 2001 under the provisions of section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, and was lodged into custody at the training unit, Glengariff Parade, Dublin 7. His girlfriend, who was present at the time of the arrest was informed of the custody arrangements. It has been confirmed by the authorities at the training unit that for the <Col N="632" /> duration of the time that the person referred to was held in custody, telephone access was afforded to him. However, he did not ask to avail of this facility. Furthermore, at no stage did the person referred to make a request to the gardaí with whom he was in contact to have a solicitor or any other person contacted on his behalf.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that arrangements were put in place to deport the individual concerned on 3 January 2001 but that Aer Lingus refused to permit him to board the aircraft due to his violent behaviour. I can confirm that the person referred to was deported on 4 January 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service, that the authority whereby prison governors can examine correspondence to and from prisoners is conferred on them by the Statutory Rules and Orders No. 320 for the Government of Prisons, 1947.</P>
      <P>Section 10 Rule 63 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every letter to or from a prisoner shall be read by the Governor, or other responsible officer deputed by the Governor, and initialled by him; and if the contents are objectionable, it shall not be forwarded, or the objectionable part shall be erased, according to discretion. <Col N="634" /> The Governor shall use his discretion in communicating to or withholding from a prisoner at any time the contents of any letter addressed to the prisoner, but shall note in his journal every case in which he thinks it proper to withhold a letter which, according to the rules, might be communicated to or written by a prisoner.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the above regulation, certain correspondence to and from prisoners remains unopened and uncensored. For example, correspondence with a prisoner's legal adviser, the European Court of Human Rights, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, known as CPT, or the Samaritans, with the name and address of the sender marked on the envelope. Correspondence from these bodies is handed to the prisoner unopened and is signed for on receipt by the prisoner.</P>
    <P>However, there are also reasonable and justifiable grounds for governors to retain the right to impose censorship in some cases. In the case of a letter sent to a prisoner where it might reasonably be expected to be a threat to good order or safe or secure custody, or where the letter might reasonably be expected to interfere with the course of justice, censorship would not only be justified, but its very absence would constitute a breach of a prison governor's statutory duty.</P>
    <P>In the case of a letter sent by a prisoner, taking account of the recipient and the prisoner, where it might reasonably be expected to cause serious offence to the recipient, the imposition of censorship is essential to protect innocent parties and past victims.</P>
    <P>While the prison service remains governed by the Statutory Rules and Orders for the Government of Prisons 1947, successive governors have interpreted and applied these regulations in the least restrictive manner consistent with the safe, secure and humane management of their establishments.</P>

Because of the geographical proximity, resources from both districts-stations patrol the whole Palmerstown area resulting in an increased level of patrolling. It should be noted that Palmerstown is policed and administered by one divisional officer and in accordance with one divisional policing plan.</P>

These and other possible relevant details are included in investigation files and reports on traffic accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1022 and 1023 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a capital grant scheme and staffing grant scheme for community not for profit group(s) are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000 to 2006.</P>
      <P>A completed application form for a staffing grant was received in the Equal Opportunities Child Care section of my Department on 15 December 2000 from the organisation in question. With regard to this application, I have been informed by my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care section that the application was forwarded to Area Development Management Ltd., on 18 December 2000. A technical assessment of this application will be carried out by ADM Ltd., prior to referral to the Programme Appraisal Committee. Once the assessment and appraisal process is complete, I will make a decision shortly thereafter. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the application.</P>
      <P>In relation to a capital grant application, I have been informed by my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care section that an application for a capital grant for community based-not for profit groups, under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000 to 2006 to extend its existing facilities, has not yet been received from this organisation.</P>
      <P>The organisation in question has been allocated funds totalling £167,000 under my Department's earlier child care funding programmes. This figure comprises capital grants totalling £60,000, a staffing grant totalling £80,000 and a grant towards organisational development, training and research totalling £27,000. All funds, with the exception of £10,000 from the staffing grant, have, to date, been drawn down by the organisation.</P>
      <P>This organisation, together with another child care centre in the Dublin area, recently jointly produced a guide to best practice in child care entitled &ldquo;Childcare: Policies and Procedures&rdquo;. This guide, which was part funded from the research and development grant committed to the project in 1999, will act as a valuable tool for child care service providers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>An application for naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department in June 1999.</P>
      <P>Due to the various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation in respect of a person of full age, together with the high number of applications being received, the average processing time at present is approximately two and a half years.</P>
      <P>Extra resources have recently been allocated to the Immigration and Citizenship division of my Department with a view to, <i>inter alia</i>, reducing the time involved in processing naturalisation applications. These resources will impact considerably on present delays.</P>

      <P>It is regretted that due to an administrative oversight, the Deputy was not informed of the outcome. It is open to the applicant to apply again in the future in the event of a change of circumstances.</P>

      <Quest>his plans for the development and encouragement of e-Government in 2001, and the amount of money included in his Department's Estimate for this purpose in 2001.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development and encouragement of electronic Government is a central theme in all IT related activity in my Department and the agencies under the auspices of my Department. Across the justice sector it is estimated that a budget of approximately £2.6 million has been provided to carry out various e-Government related projects in 2001.</P>
      <P>The following is an outline of the principal areas and projects. With regard to the development of electronic Government strategies, my Department and all its major agencies will have finalised their plans in the early part of the year. For example, the Courts Service is currently in the process of developing its first five year Information Technology Strategic Plan, &ldquo;e.Courts&rdquo;, and the provision of electronic services to both business and the citizen is being comprehensively addressed in the plan. The plan, which will be completed by early February, envisages that the website will form the basis for a courts portal which will provide regulated and secure electronic access to courts information and services within the eBroker framework approved by Government last year.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry and Registry of Deeds has also recently published its Electronic Service Delivery Strategy for 2001-04.</P>
      <P>A similar approach to the linkages to the eBroker framework is being taken in other areas of my Department.</P>
      <P>Anticipating the need to develop specific e-Government strategies, the provision of services to the general public has been a core part of the overall IT strategy of my Department for the past three years. Therefore, where it is considered that systems may in future require an electronic interface with the public, the systems procured or developed must be technically capable of being extended in this way without major re-writing. This has been part of the evaluation criteria for systems selection since 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to website development-information dissemination, it is recognised that the first step towards electronic Government is the full availability of information in a timely manner. A number of developments are taking place in the area of website development which will ensure that, in the first instance, information on all areas of the Department and its agencies is readily available. For example the Department's own website is being redeveloped and will be launched again shortly. It is being designed with a view to easing the method of publication thus ensuring that material is available on the web <Col N="641" /> simultaneously with its release on paper. In addition, its existing content will be expanded to contain full information of all schemes operated by the Department together with application forms for electronic download as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Courts Service, which launched its new website in November 1999, provides useful information in relation to the operations and services provided across all court jurisdictions. The Legal Diary is available on the website on a daily basis and provides a very useful service for the legal profession. Plans for 2001 include the enhancement of the existing site, the addition of several new sections and the provision of a judgments database.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána recently relaunched their website and it is planned to extend a website presence to all associated agencies of the Department before the end of 2001. In addition, my Department is actively participating in central e-Government initiatives such as those taking place in the area of tendering and public procurement. As an initial step, it is planned that all tenders emanating from the Department will be available in electronic format.</P>
    <P>With regard to specific major projects, in addition to the ongoing work on website and information dissemination, a number of major projects will be undertaken in 2001. Because of the nature of the Department's operations, it is considered that the Courts Service and Land Registry and Registry of Deeds represent the area which will most likely have greatest scope of electronic dealings with the public. Some of these specific projects are outlined above.</P>
    <P>The Courts Service has commissioned initial scoping reports to examine the feasibility of introducing pilot projects relating to the electronic payment of fines, electronic filing of court documents and to provide limited electronic access to the Criminal Case Tracking System. This work is ongoing and it is expected that these reports will be finalised by the end of February 2001. The Courts Service is also collaborating with my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to a pilot project which is investigating the feasibility of implementing an on-line small claims procedure. The steering committee for the pilot project of the on-line small claims procedure, chaired by the President of the District Court, held its first meeting in December 2000.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry and Registry of Deeds has completed its flagship project, which allows for organisations to have on-line access to its existing computerised database over the Internet. I understand that this was the first e-Government project to go live in the Civil Service. The project has particular benefits for the legal profession, professional law searching firms, commercial property companies and the law Departments of public and private corporations.</P>
    <P>As a precursor to the introduction of an electronic registration system, the Land Registry has embarked on an extensive programme of elec<Col N="642" /> tronically capturing and indexing its existing paper documents and to develop new systems for extensive on-line searching and record provision. This project will convert the entire paper folio and paper filed plan base to electronic format so that it can be made available through the internet in a timely and cost effective manner. This is a very challenging project with a requirement to capture over three million unique legal records which gives rise to approximately eight million imaged pages in total. The project is currently the subject of a tender competition to complete the necessary technical, imaging and indexing work.</P>
    <P>It will be expected that a number of other projects will commence in 2001 when the various e-Government strategies have been finalised.</P>
    <P>With regard to the integration of the Criminal Justice System, my Department is currently implementing a major IT programme both for the core Department and in respect of the agencies under the aegis of the Department. These developments include the implementation of a secure, web-enabled infrastructure which, in addition to supporting operational, financial and administrative systems, will also be used to allow for electronic transfer of information within the justice area, links to the other Government Departments, and future access to systems for the general public as appropriate. Because of the nature of this project, in that it provides the underlying infrastructure for all IT systems, it is neither possible nor appropriate to determine how much would be attributed to electronic Government. Most of the development began before the e-Government initiative but the software platforms are flexible enough to allow for the implementation of e-Government concepts as they evolve.</P>
    <P>A related project is also ongoing to develop and maintain a common data model and to ensure electronic transfer of information, identify and promote integration and interworking possibilities between the various elements of the Criminal Justice System.</P>
    <P>With regard to disability issues, my Department has a particular concern that its own sites, other Government sites and sites generally should be increasingly user friendly for the disabled. Following a workshop late last year the Department will be carrying forward work in this area during 2001.</P>
    <P>The provision of services by electronic means is an integral part of my Department's IT strategies and service delivery methodologies. My Department will continue to develop and pursue its e-Government strategies both within the Department and its agencies and as an active participant in the various ongoing cross Government initiatives.</P>

      <P>Sixteen companies tendered for the supply, installation and commissioning of a Garda CCTV system &ndash; comprising 29 cameras &ndash; in Cork city centre. Following an evaluation process, the contract was awarded to SKS Communications Limited.</P>
      <P>Fibre optic cabling was chosen as the transmission media for the Cork city centre CCTV system. The request for tender document for the CCTV project requested a fibre optic transmission system installed in underground ducting to be provided by Cork Corporation. The completion of the project was contingent on the availability of ducts and the identification of each cable route by the successful tenderer. The option of using a microwave transmission medium was also specified in the request for tender document but most companies submitted tenders for the fibre optic option only.</P>
      <P>SKS discovered during the course of the installation of the CCTV system that major parts of the ducting were not in place and that in other cases ducts were blocked. A ducting survey was carried out by SKS and this survey showed that available ducting did not fully correspond with that which was previously understood to be available. Discussions then took place between representatives of the Garda authorities and Cork Corporation in an effort to have the necessary ducting installed.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the corporation was unable to undertake this work and, consequently, arrangements for the carrying out of the work have been made by the Garda authorities and my Department. Approval has been obtained for the placing of the contract for the ducting with SKS as an add-on to the existing contract with the company for the supply, installation and commissioning of the Cork city CCTV system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that works are now progressing on the installation of <Col N="645" /> the CCTV system in Cork city with an expected completion date of May 2001. The final cost of the project is likely to be in excess of IR£800,000.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been allocated £250 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 April 2000, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for community based not-for-profit child care organisations and capital grants for small scale private child care providers catering for no more than 20 children to enable us to meet these objectives. Grants are also available for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, child care training and innovative projects. It is open to any <Col N="646" /> group including educational institutions to make application for this funding.</P>
    <P>In addition to the funding available under the national development plan, in October 2000, I announced details of the Government's extra £40 million anti-inflationary package for child care. Following on from this announcement, in late November 2000, I was pleased to announce the availability of capital grants, from my Department's equal opportunities child care section, to private child care providers who cater for more than 20 children.</P>
    <P>Each application is dealt with on its own merits and I can inform the Deputy that my officials are available to discuss any proposal to provide child care facilities with any organisation whether it is a community or employer initiative. I would be glad to give consideration to any proposal developed by the educational institutions.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of the availability of grants in April 2000, over £30 million in funding has been committed by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme with over £22 million being allocated in the form of capital or staffing grants to child care services on the ground to date. Almost 7,000 child care places will be supported by the funding committed by my Department which includes the creation of over 3,200 new child care places.</P>
    <P>The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1044 to 1049, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Figures relating to the number of persons refused leave to enter the State during 1999 and 2000 are set out in table one below according to the main grounds for refusal. I am advised that during 2000, 14 persons possessing valid Irish entry visas were refused permission to enter the State and detained overnight or longer in places of detention under the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended. The age, gender and stated purpose of visit are set out in Table Two below. Figures are not available for the total number of persons refused and who were in possession of a valid Irish entry visa upon arrival.</P>
      <P>Immigration controls are applied upon arrival in the State and not outside the jurisdiction, although these controls may on occasion be carried out on board a vessel or aircraft upon its arrival for operational reasons. During the period 20 November to 31 December, 2000 a total of 39 persons were refused permission to enter prior to their disembarking upon arrival in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leave to land is granted in cases where a person claims political asylum upon arrival and I can assure the Deputy that the provisions of section 9(1) of the Refugee Act, as amended, which so requires are strictly complied with. The full commencement by me of the Act on 20 November 2000 was preceded by a series of seminars for <Col N="652" /> immigration officers throughout the State. The instructions issued at those seminars emphasised the obligation on an immigration officer to assist an asylum applicant in making his or her application and to comply generally with the provisions of the Act and this applies equally when immigration controls are carried out upon arrival in the State prior to disembarkation.</P>
    <P>In so far as the question of embarkation outside of the jurisdiction is concerned, the position is that most carriers carry out documentation checks of their passengers prior to boarding. In many jurisdictions, including all EU states, fines can be applied to carriers when a passenger arrives in the jurisdiction without the necessary documentation required for entry. I have recently received Government approval to draft similar legislation for Ireland and work is well under way in my Department in this regard.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions have already taken place with a range of carriers regarding the proposed legislation. Arising from that consultation process, a number of carriers have sought advice and assistance in advance of the introduction of the legislation. Irish Ferries sought such assistance of the Garda National Immigration Bureau with a view to reducing the extent to which its Cherbourg-Rosslare route was being abused by persons travelling on false documents. Both the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the French Frontier Police agree that this route is the main transit point for illegal entry from France to Ireland. The resultant checks by Irish Ferries staff at Cherbourg, drawing on the advice given by members of the Garda National Immigration Bureau, have resulted in a significant increase in the number of person refused permission to travel on the basis that they were carrying inadequate or false documents. Members of the Garda Bureau are fully aware that they are acting in an advisory capacity only and that the company reserve the right of decision in relation to refusing to carry a passenger whose documentation is not adequate. Although the number of persons in question would principally be a matter for the company itself, my understanding is that during the period 20 November, 2000 to 31 December, 2000 124 persons were refused permission to embark on the basis of advice from Garda National Immigration Bureau officers.</P>
    <P>It is not known what the intention of the persons refused boarding by Irish Ferries might have been had they entered Ireland. Many of the persons may have planned to claim asylum, to take up employment illegally, or to use this country as a transit point for the United Kingdom. In any event, any of the persons in question who wished to seek asylum would be in a position to make the necessary application to the French authorities or to the authorities in the EU state through which he or she first entered the territory of the European Union. This approach is reflected in the principles underpinning the Dublin Convention to which all EU states are parties.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service, that the person referred to was committed to Mountjoy Prison on 12 January 2001, on foot of committal warrants issued by the Dublin Metropolitan District Court. The first warrant ordered his imprisonment for a period of three months for road traffic offences and the second ordered that he be detained in Mountjoy Prison pending his extradition to the United Kingdom in relation to charges of illegally trespassing on a building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On committal to Mountjoy, the prisoner was interviewed in the prison reception by a medical orderly who recorded that the offender was fit and well, had no complaints and had no psychiatric history. In addition he had no drug or alco<Col N="656" /> hol addiction problems and was not on any medication. To date he has not been seen by a psychiatrist nor has he requested such a visit.</P>
    <P>The prisoner has since visited the prison doctor on two separate occasions. He was prescribed medication for his condition on both occasions. He has made no complaint to the prison authorities and they have no record of the offender suffering from hypothermia. I am satisfied that his medical needs have and are currently being attended to by the relevant medical authorities in Mountjoy Prison. In the circumstances I see no reason to alert the United Kingdom authorities in relation to his medical condition.  </P>

    <P>We know from the Garda statistics that approximately 99% of those reported missing in any year are accounted for by the end of the year. We must realise that not all of the people who go missing do so in suspicious circumstances, which would be of interest to the gardaí.

      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that, <i>inter alia</i>, a non-national, whether a national of an EU State or otherwise, who is married to an Irish citizen may make a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post nuptial citizenship no earlier than three years from the date of marriage to the Irish citizen or from the date on which the Irish spouse became an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999, which is currently at Report Stage in the House having been passed by the Seanad, provides, at sections 4 and 5, for the termination of the present system of post nuptial citizenship, but with a three year transition period for those already married to Irish citizens before the passing of the Bill, and its replacement by a naturalisation procedure. This special naturalisation procedure for spouses of Irish citizens is in broad terms to be similar to the naturalisation provisions at the present section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, and will exist in parallel with it. The principal difference proposed is that in relation to the residence requirement, the period for the spouse of an Irish citizen will be at a discount relative to the normal requirement, in total, three out of the previous five years for a spouse, as against the normal requirement of five years out of the previous nine.</P>

      <P>On 19 December 2000, the Government agreed to my proposals to enhance the range of interests to be represented on the Human Rights Commission through the creation of six additional positions on the commission. I would hope to be in a position to confirm the names of the additional commissioners to be appointed soon. The necessary legislative amendments to give effect to these developments will be contained in the proposed legislation to provide for the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is due to be published in the current parliamentary session. In the meantime, pending the enactment of this amending legislation, it is my wish that the new commission would begin its work on an interim basis.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles and Deeds that the waiting time for the processing of Land Registry dealings is as set out in the tabular statement below. As the Deputy will appreciate, the length of time taken to complete cases varies depending on a number of things including the complexity of the case, the <Col N="660" /> completeness of the documentation forwarded by solicitors, etc. The volume of business being transacted at any stage would also have a bearing on matters. The Deputy may also wish to note that any cases involving urgency are, in accordance with the customer service policy of the Land Registry, dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>The figures shown, in the tabular statement below, for Kildare-Wicklow represent the time frame for any case lodged since the roll out of ITRIS, Integrated Title Registration Information System. I have been informed by the Land Registry that pre-ITRIS cases in these areas are taking approximately two years to complete.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the current buoyancy in the economy, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds continues to grow at an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. The total intake of new cases for the year 2000 amounted to 161,844. This represents an increase of 29,485 over the 1999 intake.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increase in property transactions, major infrastructural projects undertaken by the bodies responsible for systems and utilities e.g. Bord Gáis, ESB, Coillte, National Roads Authority, Bord na Móna etc. have also placed considerable strain on the Registry's ability to provide essential services. In the circumstances, <Col N="661" /> the staff in the Land Registry have worked very hard to give the best possible service to their customers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in order to address this problem, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing complement of the Land Registry by 77. The resultant appointments are currently being made following a recruitment drive by the Civil Service Commission which is now beginning to pay dividends.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems which have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management is implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation. These include improvements to work flow the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will improve shortly.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the central transfer lists for provincial locations which are maintained by my Department in respect of general Civil Service grades. These lists include staff currently serving in my Department and those in other Government Departments who have expressed an interest in transferring to my Department's offices outside of the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The position on transfers to provincial areas for staff officers and clerical officers is that they are arranged in accordance with the standardised transfer system which has been agreed with the Civil and Public Service Union and which applies to all Government Departments. The agreement provides that applications for transfer are recorded in order of the date of receipt of each application. When vacancies arise they must then be offered in this order. No formal transfer agreement with the relevant unions exists for staff at executive officer level or above and the lists maintained by my Department for those grades may only be regarded as a record of a person's interest in being accommodated with a transfer to a particular location should a suitable opportunity arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to provide the Deputy with two separate tables with details of the numbers and grades currently on my Department's transfer lists. This is because the Courts Service has <Col N="662" /> recently established its own transfer lists in respect of staff wishing to transfer to the Circuit and District Court offices around the country.</P>
    <P>Table A is used to fill general service grade vacancies in Garda Síochána offices and Probation and Welfare Service offices around the country as well as the Waterford Office of the Land Registry and the Finance division in Killarney.</P>
    <P>Table B provides details of those who have applied for a transfer to the Courts Service only.</P>
    <P>I should mention that both tables may include persons who, since making their application, have been promoted or left their parent Department for reasons unknown to my own Department.</P>

      <P>Section 11 of the Children Act, 1997 inserts 12 new sections into the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, two of which &ndash; sections 26, social reports in the District Court, and 28, appointment of guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child and provision for separate representation, remain to be brought into operation by ministerial order. Those two sections have staffing implications for the Probation and Welfare Service and health boards and they will be brought into operation as soon as the necessary staff can be made available.Colour RGB 0,0,128 </P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the allocation of Garda resources, and the policing of public disorder are operational matters which are the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. I understand from the Garda authorities that local Garda management have been meeting Dublin Bus management and union representatives on a monthly basis for the past number of years. The most recent meeting was 8 January 2001. At this meeting, Dublin Bus personnel expressed themselves as being very satisfied with the Garda in relation to response to incidents on their buses and Garda co-operation in general.</P>
      <P>At each meeting, Dublin Bus management produce details of incidents for the previous month, and from a very early stage, it has been emphasised to the union representatives that they should report criminal damage or abusive behaviour.</P>
      <P>Over the Christmas 2000 period, incidents increased and a number of arrests were made. Many incidents related to young people in the 12 &ndash; 16 years age group. I understand that the principal Garda concern is tackling the incidents related to the 77 bus route along Cheeverstown Road-Brookfield to Jobstown terminus where bus windows have been kicked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> I am informed that to deal with complaints from Dublin Bus, the following procedure has been in place: community gardaí on duty in their respective areas travel on buses and discuss problems with drivers. The public order units, special response and traffic units give constant attention to Dublin Bus, particularly in the west Tallaght areas.</P>
    <P>The community gardaí, in conjunction with school teachers in west Tallaght and Dublin Bus personnel, have pursued a policy with the young people in the various schools which included an art competition focusing on Dublin Bus and it's positive aspects. Winners of this competition will have their entry displayed on the side of buses in the near future.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the gardaí will continue ongoing liaison with South Dublin County Council housing department regarding their policies on anti-social behaviour and will participate with the proposed Tallaght Public Transport Forum.</P>

      <P>The 1997 Programme for Government included, in the context of measures to combat the drugs problem, the creation of a drug courts system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences.</P>
      <P>Following the reports of the Working Group on a Courts Commission and an expert Drug Court Planning Committee which I established, the Pilot Drug Court Programme was launched in the Dublin District Court on 9 January 2001. The Drug Court Planning Committee included representatives of a wide range of interests, including the community sector. Strict criteria must be satisfied before an offender may be admitted to the drug court programme. Specifically, the offender must be over 17 years of age; reside within the catchment area, Dublin's north inner city, for a minimum of one year; have pleaded guilty or been found guilty in court of a non-violent criminal offence; be liable to be sentenced if convicted; be dependent on the use of prohibited drugs and-or prescribed drugs; have a clear understanding of the implications of participation with the drug court; and be willing to co-operate with supervision, stop offending, avail of appropriate drug treatment and participate generally on the programme put in place.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that it is a matter for the judiciary as to whether an offender should be admitted into the drug court programme. Acceptance into the programme does not mean the participant can no longer be dealt with by the ordinary criminal courts. A participant may have his or her participation in the drug court programme terminated for non-compliance with the rules of the programme and in that event, he or she is referred back to the original court for the finalisation of his or her case.</P>
      <P>The pilot programme marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and is designed as an alternative measure for dealing with less serious and non-violent drug offenders and I look forward to assessing the results of the pilot project in due course.</P>

      <P>First, I should state that the most recent annual report of An Garda Síochána relates to 1999. As the House is aware there has been an increase in the number of reported rapes in recent years. This is, perhaps, due to a number of factors as I have previously outlined to the House. Among these factors are the higher incidence of rape in the present day, cases of rape which occurred in previous years being reported in the present day and, perhaps, an increased willingness on the part of victims to report rape which may be due to the availability of better services for victims. I will shortly be publishing a <Col N="668" /> research project, commissioned by my Department and carried out by University College Cork in association with the Cork and Kerry Rape Crisis Centres, which examined why there are high attrition rates &ndash; i.e. the progressive reduction between the number of crimes committed and the number which end in conviction &ndash; in sexual assault cases. I believe that increased prosecutions for rape will act as a deterrent to this heinous crime and I will do my utmost to improve the system for prosecuting such cases.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, which is at present awaiting the second Report Stage in the Dáil, provides for separate legal representation for victims of rape and other serious sexual offences in particular circumstances. As the Deputy may be aware the network of Rape Crisis Centres and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre are both represented on the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, which is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They are fully involved in the work of the committee, which is charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with the responsibility for providing a multi-agency, cohesive response to victims of violence. Through awareness campaigns the committee is urging victims to come forward and report incidents of violence, including rape and sexual assault. In 2001 funding from the Department of Health and Children for victim services and facilities has increased and this will, I have no doubt, benefit the range and level of services in all regions.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána and, in particular, the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit liaise with rape crisis centres throughout the country and encourage early reporting by victims who contact the centres. In addition, the Garda Síochána Research Unit at the Garda Training College, Templemore, has had a number of workshops with the rape crisis centres and other NGOs on reconciling the statistics on sexual offences produced by the various agencies involved so as to more accurately assess the levels of reported sexual crime.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that Operation Oíche began in the Dublin metropolitan region on 9 October, 2000. I understand that as part of this operation each divisional officer compiled an operational plan which incorporated all initiatives and operations to combat public order and illicit drug use. I am also informed that additional plans to focus on public intoxication and underage drinking were <Col N="669" /> also included. The Garda authorities consider the operation to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction, there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and night clubs and the gardaí continue to visit licensed premises to impress an even greater awareness on the licensees of their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the new Dublin Corporation bye-laws prohibiting the consumption of intoxicating liquor on public streets have proven very effective. I am assured by the Garda authorities that the gardaí are fully focused on all the objectives of Operation Oíche and that since the initiative began, over 7,500 offences have been detected. I also understand that Operation Oíche has received favourable comments from both the general public and the business community.</P>

      <P>My Department operates the equal opportunities child care programme and has responsibility for £250 million being provided for child care under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department has also been allocated by the Government a further £26.5 million as part of an additional £40 million package for child care. This funding has been targeted at measures intended to maintain and increase the number of child care places available. To date I have approved funding to 272 projects which will directly impact on the number of child care places being supported and created &ndash; these projects range from child care centres to single operator child care service providers. The total amount committed by my Department to these projects, to date, is £22.1 million. To date funding under the Programme will create over 3,200 new childcare places and will support over 3,700 existing places. The funding will also lead to improvements in quality and, in some cases, allow child care providers extend their opening hours. The Deputy has requested a list of the name and organisations in receipt of grant aid from my Department's Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme and the amounts that have been allocated. As the list is quite lengthy, I will not detail them here. However I have made a list of the 272 projects available to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The capital grants currently available under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme were developed in line with the recommendations of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000. Capital grants of up to £40,000 are available to self-employed/private child care providers for building, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities and for the purchase of permanently based child care equipment. Budget 2000 also provided improvements to the capital allowances in relation to the costs of construction, refurbishment or extension of premises. I am satisfied that the current grant level is meeting the requirements of self-employed/private child care providers and the scheme is kept under constant review.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been allocated £250 million comprising EU and Exchequer funding over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. The objectives of this funding are to increase the availability of child care places, to improve the quality of child care provision and to ensure the co-ordination of child care service provision on a local and national basis. In addition to the funding available under the national development plan, in October 2000, I announced details of further Government funding of £40 million for child care development.</P>
      <P>Since the announcement of the availability of grants in April 2000, over £30 million in funding has been committed by my Department under the equal opportunities child care programme with over £22 million being allocated in the form of capital or staffing grants to child care services on the ground. To date, almost 7,000 child care places will be supported by the funding committed by my Department which includes the creation of over 3,200 new child care places.</P>
      <P>The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

      <P>The status of petitions in respect of fines imposed by courts exercising criminal jurisdiction is set out in section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, as amended by section 17 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, and having regard to a 1995 High Court judgment on petitions. The High Court judgment states that the power to mitigate penalties should be used sparingly and only for special reasons. It also noted that the petitions procedure is not a parallel or alternative system of justice to that provided by the courts.</P>
      <P>I wrote to all Members of the Oireachtas in 1998 about the petitions procedure. Also, detailed information about the very restricted scope of the procedure is provided in the combined information sheet and application form for the guidance of intending applicants. The question of the enforcement of warrants is addressed in both the general letter and the combined information sheet and application form. There is no statutory requirement on the Garda Síochána to defer the enforcement of a warrant in respect of a penalty under petition. There is, in fact, an obligation on the Garda Síochána to enforce all warrants irrespective of their status.</P>

      <P>I met with representatives from Castle Saunderson, accompanied by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, on 14 December last, at which the group presented its proposal to establish a permanent Jamboree campsite for the scouting movement in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I explained to the group that the only scheme of sports funding administered directly by my Department for voluntary and community groups was the sports capital programme. The development of sporting and recreation facilities are the focus of this programme and the closing date for the receipt of applications under the 2001 programme is 9 February next.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the group has made submissions to other Ministers regarding funding for the project. Following the November meeting, I wrote to my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, who, as Minister for Youth Affairs, would be in the best position to co-ordinate efforts to investigate possible sources of funding across different Departments for the project.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with Questions Nos. 1091 and 1104 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's e-mail address for general queries from the public is webmaster@tourism-sport.irlgov.ie. In addition, the Department operates specific e-mail addresses for aspects of its work in which the public may have a particular interest. For example, a specific e-mail address was advertised in December 2000 for requests for information and application forms under the 2001 sports capital programme which is sports unit@tourism-sport.irlgov.ie. My Department's e-mail address for queries under the Freedom of Information Act is foi@tourism-sport.irlgov.ie. Furthermore all officers of the Department have individual internet e-mail addresses which are used as appropriate for official business.</P>
      <P>While the Department's quality customer service action plan published in December 1997 does not specifically refer to e-mail queries, nevertheless, every effort is made to ensure that the principles set out in the plan are applied in the case of such queries. These include the aim to provide a definitive reply within 20 working days.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that e-mail queries to the sports capital programme website are dealt with well within that timeframe and e-mail queries relating to the Freedom of Information Act are dealt with in accordance with the timeframes laid down in the Act.</P>
      <P>General e-mail queries to the Department which are received <i>via</i> the Department's website are routinely monitored centrally and distributed to the relevant divisions within the Department and/or to State agencies under its aegis as appropriate for direct reply or for data to be collated centrally before a reply issues. During the last quarter of 2000, 19 general e-mail queries were received <i>via</i> the Department's website and by 19 January 2001, ten of those queries had received responses. The remainder have now been dealt with.</P>
      <P>My Department constantly keeps its procedures for dealing with queries from the public, including e-mail queries under review to ensure the best possible service is provided and is currently in the process of updating its quality customer service action plan. I expect the new plan to be available in early April.</P>

      <P>In 1997, the Government allocated £10 million to support the implementation of measures contained in the action plans prepared by the local drugs task forces. Over 200 projects were supported, to deliver a range of interventions under the themes of prevention, education, treatment, rehabilitation and supply reduction. A sum of £728,000 was allocated to support 12 projects in the Dublin North East Task Force area.</P>
      <P>The Government has now allocated a further £15 million to enable the task forces to prepare new updated plans. To date, seven plans have been submitted to the national drugs strategy team for assessment. It is expected that the remainder will be submitted over the next few months and that the new plans will commence operation during 2001.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's national drugs strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund was established by the Government in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies/initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the fund has been on local drugs task force areas and funding of over £26 million has been allocated to support almost 300 projects contained in the plans emanating from these areas. In the case of Dublin North East, over £1.8 million was approved to support 27 separate projects in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1093 and 1094 together.</P>
      <P>Framework III of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to identify the 25 most deprived urban and rural communities to which will be delivered, under a targeted investment programme, a range of measures aimed at economic and community development.</P>
      <P>A proposal will shortly be made to Government regarding implementation and operation of such a programme. Once administrative aspects are finalised, there will be a formal public announcement which will identify the areas to be the target of support, implementation arrangements and the range of investments and supports available.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of drawing up the proposal, consultation was undertaken with the social partners. One group within the community and voluntary pillar of the social partners expressed a desire for a more elaborate consultation, decision making and implementation process. The proposals which I will bring to Government aim to address these concerns particularly regarding the involvement of local partnership companies in the delivery structure. At the same time these proposals will also aim to ensure that agencies charged with actual expenditure, and provision of facilities and services, have the scope to act quickly and deliver an accelerated programme of investment in these communities. In consultations with the social partners, the Department has endeavoured to achieve this essential balance between local input into programme design, and identification of priorities, and achievement of a clear administrative focus, on the quick and efficient delivery of investment to address those priorities.</P>
      <P>An implementation budget will be put in place to provide for the employment of local co-ordinators, and a central co-ordination team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the District Electoral Division was simply the starting point used to identify areas of disadvantage and was a useful unit in so far as objective statistics based on DEDs existed. This approach was accepted by all of the parties in the consultative process. The designated areas which will be proposed to Government will mainly consist of clusters of DEDs, in some cases sub divisions of DEDs and where necessary boundaries <Col N="681" /> were adjusted to correspond to a local understanding of community, and to take account of deprived neighbourhoods which lie in close proximity to but not within a particular DED.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the programme will involve a structure incorporating agencies currently responsible at local level for delivery of aspects of social policy, and consultation with the local community. I believe this structure will deliver an investment programme effectively and efficiently and is in keeping with Government policy in relation to the preparation and implementation of a strategy for economic, social and cultural development at local level by the city and county development boards.</P>

      <P>Following consultation with local authorities regarding the scope within disadvantaged areas to put forward suitable proposals which would attract finance through the initiative, and drawing on the Trutz-Haase Index of disadvantage, the Government designated Ballyfermot as the Irish priority area for support under this initiative.

      <P>The 2001 sports capital programme was advertised in the national press on 15 and 17 December 2000. The closing date for receipt of application forms is Friday, 9 February 2001. Funding under the programme is available to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation.</P>
      <P>The criteria used by my Department to evaluate applications for grant aid are outlined in section 5 of the guidelines, terms and conditions of the 2001 sports capital programme, a copy of which follows for the Deputy's information. Extract from Guidelines, Terms and Conditions of the 2001 Sports Capital Programme:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.1. All applications will be treated on their merits and highest priority will be afforded to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people. High priority projects will include those which are essential or integral to sports participation or performance, e.g. pitch development, floodlighting, dressing rooms/showers. Priority for funding under the programme will not be afforded to works which are not essential or integral to sports participation or performance, <Col N="683" /> e.g. landscaping of grounds, boundary fences, equipment stores, car parks.</P>
    <P>5.2. Applicants should note that for the purpose of the Programme, disadvantaged areas have been defined as those areas which have been designated by Government under the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development. (Current list at Appendix 1).</P>
    <P>5.3. Assessment criteria have been developed to help assess applications so that those offering the greatest community benefit are supported. The criteria will focus on: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport/recreational sport and/or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, i.e. does the project comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities, possession of planning permission; the financial viability of the project, i.e. in addition to lottery funding, has the club/organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe. Previous track record in fund raising is also taken into account; the level of local funding available. Higher rating is given to projects with a significant local contribution; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, as defined by ADM Ltd's indicators, and the current and planned levels of sport and/or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements/facilities in relation to the club's or organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1103 and 1110 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte, the regional tourism authorities (RTAs) and Shannon Development have encouraged and continue to encourage tourism providers to provide for the care and activity needs of disabled persons in order to help such persons make informed decisions regarding their holiday choice. The bodies contracted by Bord Fáilte to carry out inspections of tourist accommodation, request information from all operators, seeking approval or registration, on the accessibility of their respective premises. As a result, accommodation guides in respect of hotels, guesthouses, Irish homes and holiday hostels already provide an indication of those premises which have facilities and services that are accessible to persons with special needs. In most cases, symbols indicating accessibility of premises are utilised with the approval of Comhairle, the body now incorporating the roles previously carried out by the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a feeling among relevant groups, including the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWA), that there is room for improvement in relation to the inspection of premises from the disabilities perspective and the compilation of relevant information. I understand Bord Fáilte propose to research this issue with a view to an up-to-date list of accommodation accessible for people with disabilities being compiled. Bord Failte will liaise with the IWA and other relevant disability groups in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1118, 1293, and 1303 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>My approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000/01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
      <P>With regard to rent costs, in recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government has introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government will be evaluating the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation. These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and as such represent a targeted <Col N="690" /> response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage. Architectural planning for the project referred to by the Deputy is progressing. The grant of planning permission for the extension is currently awaited. When this has been received, the matter will be progressed further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Inclusiveness and transparency are core principles underpinning the certificate examinations. The examinations were made more inclusive last year by allowing a student, depending on his/her special need, have his/her result in a subject based upon all except some element of the examination in that subject. I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases the grade awarded is a full and accurate reflection of the candidate's performance in the examination and the examination certificates issued by my Department state that unequivocally.</P>
      <P>This new measure enables a candidate to obtain maximum marks for the subject even though his/her special need precludes him/her from demonstrating attainment in core elements of the standard assessment. As such it discriminates in favour of the special needs candidate by allowing him/her a waiver not available to candidates generally.</P>
      <P>The change made last year aligns our examination system with best international practice where changes to standard assessment that arise as a result of granting the assistance of readers and scribes are enabled by including an explanatory note on the examination certificate.</P>
      <P>The explanatory note does not make any reference to a candidate's disability or special need. It does no more than provide factual information on how the standard national assessment was modified to facilitate the candidate.</P>
      <P>These significant enhancements are again available to candidates sitting for examination this year. Architectural planning for the project referred to by the Deputy is progressing. The grant of planning permission for the extension is currently awaited. When this has been received, the matter will be progressed further.</P>

      <P>I strongly endorse the Gaelic Athletic Association's aim to conserve and promote the Irish language and culture. I know that, since its foundation, the association has done excellent work in order to sustain Irish people's awareness of and love for our heritage. I welcome in particular the emphasis in the Association's Plean Gaeilge na Mílaoise/Plan for the Irish Language in the New Millennium on the place of Irish in the community and on its value in the context of the rich and diverse European heritage. Education has played a major role in ensuring that a significant number of people in the country can and do speak Irish and are positively disposed towards <Col N="692" /> the language. The Education Act, 1998, sets out the duties of schools, and of the education system generally, in relation to facilitating and extending the use of Irish at school and in the community, and to the promotion and development of Irish culture. A number of recent initiatives, such as the transition year, the leaving certificate vocational programme, the leaving certificate applied and the school development planning initiative have led to the development of productive partnerships between schools and the communities that they serve. Thus, schools subject to the priorities established by their boards of management, are in a good position to engage in the type of partnership approach envisaged in the association's plan. The White Paper on Adult Education contains a number of proposals to provide for the needs of adults in relation to Irish. There is provision for a partnership approach involving Irish language bodies, adult education interests, Údarás na Gaeltachta, vocational education committees and area partnerships in Gaeltacht areas. An Irish language officer will be appointed to the National Adult Learning Council when that body has been established.</P>

      <P>The service provided by the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, of my Department to the school named by the Deputy has unfortunately been suspended over the past two school years due to an unforeseen career break. It was not possible to provide a substitute psychologist immediately as recruitment for NEPS has taken longer than anticipated. However, this school is regarded as having particular needs and was identified as a priority for the assignment of newly appointed psychologists. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 28 additional psychologists have taken up their posts in NEPS since the beginning of September. One of these psychologists has been assigned to the named school. She has now completed the programme of induction training, and is beginning her work in schools.</P>

The local authority has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances. As the candidate to whom the Deputy refers is not an independent mature candidate, the candidate's parent(s) are required to have been resident in the administrative area of Laois County Council from 1 October 1998 &ndash; the candidate entered her approved course in 1999. As the candidate's parent(s) do not fulfil the residency requirement the candidate was deemed ineligible to be assessed for grant assistance.

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the comprehensive survey of all primary schools, which was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000 at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Almost 75% of primary schools responded to the survey with completed survey questionnaires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of accepted socio-economic variables were used to compute an index of disadvantage for each school surveyed. These variables included unemployment, medical card possession and residence in local authority housing which have been found in the past to be valid indicators <Col N="698" /> of disadvantage at school level. Separate indices were used for rural and urban schools to reflect the findings of previous research that showed that educational disadvantage manifests itself differently in urban and rural locations.</P>
    <P>Schools were ranked in order of the number of disadvantaged pupils in each school which participated in the survey. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need and the findings form the basis of the new programme which I announced earlier this month to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. The programme involves expenditure of some £26 million over a three year period, including the allocation of 204 new teacher posts and supplementary funding to primary schools with concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports must be targeted at the disadvantaged pupils in each school. The programme has both an urban and rural phase and the allocation of resources on a 3:1 basis between the two is consistent with the survey finding in relation to the distribution of educationally disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>All the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme. Almost 2,300 primary schools will receive supplementary grant aid under the new programme based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the ERC survey. Details of the schools eligible for assistance under the programme have been published and I will arrange to have a copy forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that a 25% increase in the level of maintenance grant would cost about £17 million per annum. The effect on numbers eligible and the consequent costs of a 25% increase in income limits would require a complex exercise and I am not in a position at present to convey these costs to the Deputy. However, it is proposed to have costings of the effect of changes in income limits carried out for the special review of student support which I announced late last year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1144, 1162, 1201 and 1218 together.</P>
      <P>The action of ASTI in withdrawing from supervision and refusing to substitute for absent colleagues had the direct result of schools not being able to operate and the cancellation of classes. In the circumstances, the Government decided that payment should not be made for those days of action when the schools concerned could not operate normally. Deductions were made in respect of three of those days in the salary payments which were received by teachers on 21 December 2000. Subsequent to these deductions being processed, the leadership of ASTI agreed to enter a talks process and the Government agreed, at the facilitator's request, to suspend further deductions and refund the three days deducted. As Deputies will know, ASTI withdrew from these talks.</P>
      <P>My Department was notified on 21 December by solicitors representing the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland that they had been instructed to seek a judicial review of the decision to deduct pay from members of ASTI in respect of the days of action. I confirm that, as a gesture of goodwill on the part of the Government, the salary which was deducted from ASTI members in December in respect of the three days of action was refunded to all teachers concerned on 25 January.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that agreement has now been reached with ASTI that both parties will request the Labour Court, acting on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, to consider the dispute and to make recommendations for the resolution of the dispute. In all the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any matters in relation to the dispute at this time.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received representations from principal teachers in Tallaght, Dublin 24, concerning the severe difficulty in recruiting qualified teachers to fill posts; his plans to assist schools in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. This has arisen because of two main factors. The first is that the Government has increased demand for teachers generally by creating extra posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage, while the second is that the number of trained teachers graduating from our training colleges had fallen to a very low level, for example, 291 graduated in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate these difficulties. The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares to an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further postgraduate course will commence early this year with a proposed intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280. The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 academic year. Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years, it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared to 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced and B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have provided that these teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for a period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers. Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, <Col N="703" /> which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>As I recently announced, it is my intention to make education services available through the month of July in all special facilities catering for children with autism. The extended coverage involved will be supported at the same level as applies throughout the normal school year. This will involve the deployment of a special class teacher and two special needs assistants for each class of six children through the July period.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently finalising detailed proposals for the operation of the extended service and will shortly be consulting with the relevant managerial authorities and teacher representatives with a view to securing agreement on the proposed arrangements. I am confident that the proposals being developed by my Department to facilitate this important extension of service for children with autism will secure the support of the management and staff of the schools in question who have always shown enormous commitment to the children in their care. I also point out that such an extended service has been in place for some time in a range of special schools catering for children with severe or profound general learning disabilities.</P>
      <P>Based on the level of provision currently in place for children with autism and the anticipated further demand for such services, it is estimated that the extension of service through the month of July will involve an additional annual cost of approximately £500,000. The question of extending the July coverage to other categories of special needs children will be kept under review in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to an announcement by the Taoiseach on 15 December 1999 concerning a Government three year plan to address educational disadvantage at all levels. One of the measures proposed was the allocation of 204 teaching posts for allocation to primary schools with the most significant concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The initial step in delivering this programme for primary schools entailed the identification of the number of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils in each primary school. All primary schools were requested to participate in a comprehensive and objective survey that was designed to identify the level of concentration in each school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with education disadvantage and early school leaving. The survey, which began in April 2000, was carried out by the Educational Research Centre &ndash; ERC &ndash; in Drumcondra for my Department. More than 75% of schools participated in the survey and the final results only became available to my Department late last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 4 January last, I launched a £26 million, three year programme to address educational disadvantage in primary schools and schools with concentrations of educationally disadvantaged pupils were invited to participate shortly after that date. The new programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to 2,276 primary <Col N="705" /> schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. As schools confirm their intention to participate in the programme, my Department will immediately sanction the filling of the new teacher posts.</P>
    <P>My Department has taken a number of steps to address the teacher supply situation. Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years, it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared to 1995 when 291 graduated. Accordingly, I am satisfied that there will be sufficient trained teachers available to meet demands arising under the new programme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may know, I am developing through NEPS a psychological service that would be available to all schools. A programme of recruitment began last summer. A total of 28 additional psychologists have been appointed since last September. This will allow NEPS to assign two additional psychologists to the Waterford region. They are beginning immediately to work in post-primary schools and will start work in primary schools before Easter. It is envisaged that they will be able to provide a psychological service initially to approximately 7,000 primary school pupils in the city and county.</P>

      <P>The question of a change of pick-up point for the family in question has been reviewed. The vehicle that operates the service in question is a 26-seater medium sized bus. The road to the family home is narrow, overgrown with hanging branches and briars and does not have a suitable turning point. The road in its current condition would not be suitable for the vehicle to drive along.</P>
      <P>However, the family in question is not eligible for free transport to the school attended as it is not their appropriate school. They are availing of concessionary fare-paying facilities. In the circumstances, it would not be open to my Department to extend the service for pupils who are not fully eligible for transport.</P>

      <P>The National Parents Council, Primary has been centrally involved in all the discussions regarding parent involvement in the implementation of the curriculum.

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to expenditure on schemes and programmes to address educational disadvantage is currently being compiled by my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Breaking the Cycle is a five year pilot project for the period up to 30 June 2001. The project is being evaluated by the Educational Research <Col N="708" /> Centre, Drumcondra. The final evaluation report will be submitted to the Department at the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that earlier this month I launched a major new programme to address educational disadvantage at primary level. The new programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to approximately 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. Any extension of the Breaking the Cycle pilot project must, therefore, be considered not only on the basis of the final evaluation report on the pilot phase, but also in the context of the range of measures now being provided to schools under the new programme. Schools included in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project will retain the resources currently available to them and will receive additional funding under the new programme.</P>

      <P>Remedial teaching posts are allocated to each second level school to meet the needs of pupils who require learning support. Additional teaching hours are also allocated in respect of pupils with assessed special educational needs. Each such case is considered on its merits and additional teaching hours are allocated on the recommendation of the psychological service.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a scheme for the provision of grants for second level schools towards the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment and software, for the use of pupils with certain disabilities or communication difficulties. The purpose of the scheme is to provide such pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. It is open to all second level schools with such a pupil or pupils enrolled to make an application under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently initiated a pilot scheme to assist second level students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. A total of 31 schools around the country are participating in this pilot project costing £2 million. Each student with dyslexia or other reading difficulties will be provided with a laptop computer for school and home use. A grant of £2,700 per student will be paid for the purchase of laptops and specially designed software for second year students identified as eligible for the project. Dedicated teacher training will also be provided and the National Centre <Col N="709" /> for Technology in Education &ndash; NCTE &ndash; will co-ordinate the project. There are three County Dublin Vocational Education Committee schools involved in this project. They are: Greenhills college, Limekiln Avenue, Dublin 12; Riversdale community college, Blanchardstown Road North, Dublin 15; and St. Kevin's community college, Clondalkin, Dublin 22.</P>
    <P>I have established a special task force to review current approaches to the educational needs of children with dyslexia and to make recommendations on how support services for such children should be developed for the future. The task force, which comprises experts in the field of dyslexia, commenced its work in October 2000 and I expect to receive its report shortly. I am confident that the report of the task force will provide a valuable basis for the further development of education services for children with dyslexia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is being compiled and will be forwarded directly to him.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and to alleviate the current supply difficulties. The total intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was increased to 1,283. This compares to an intake of 500 in 1996-7. There are approximately 1,000 students enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. A further postgraduate course will commence in the near future with a proposed intake of 280 students, bringing the total to 1,280.</P>
      <P>The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2001-02 academic year. Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years, it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared to 1995 when 291 graduated. As a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers, my Department requested the colleges of education to provide postgraduate courses to enable degree holders train as primary teachers. The duration of the postgraduate full-time course is 18 months. Eligible post-primary teachers may apply for this course in the normal way. These courses were provided in the 1995-6, 1997-8, 1998-9 and 1999-2000 academic years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All aspects of primary teacher training are the subject of ongoing review between my Department and the colleges of education. The management bodies and the INTO are aware that there are a number of factors which affect the demand for primary teachers and aggravate the shortage. These include the number of teachers opting to take a career break; the number of secondments approved; and the age at which teachers opt to retire on a voluntary basis. In addition, the Government has increased demand for teachers generally by creating an extra 1,875 posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage. There are no proposals at present to provide any <Col N="711" /> other type of conversion courses other than the full-time 18 month postgraduate courses.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. In the current academic year, teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have provided that these teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers. These Montessori trained teachers are also granted restricted recognition to teach in a temporary or permanent capacity in certain special schools and special classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to grant fully qualified teachers, who trained outside the State, restricted recognition to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>I can clarify that the person referred to by the Deputy is employed under a scheme introduced by my Department in 1978 for the provision of full-time secretaries in primary and secondary schools. While my Department funds her salary, her employer is the managerial authority of Rice College, Westport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985, two pension schemes, a contributory <Col N="712" /> pension scheme and a spouses' and children's pension scheme, were introduced for school secretaries employed under the 1978 scheme. An option was extended to all serving school secretaries, including the person referred to by the Deputy, to join the schemes or remain outside their scope. A form issued at that time to all schools employing a secretary under the 1978 scheme, requesting each secretary to declare whether he or she wished to participate in the pension schemes. The person referred to by the Deputy returned this form to the Department, having signed it on 12 December 1985, clearly stating that she did not wish to participate in the pension schemes.</P>
    <P>I wish to apologise to the Deputy in respect of a reply to parliamentary Question No. 405 on 12 December last. The information contained in that reply mistakenly referred to secretaries employed by schools under the PESP scheme of additional <i>per capita</i> grants.</P>

    <P>The survey is now complete and the information has been passed to Area Development Management Ltd for use in targeting State support to areas most in need of additional child care places. It is envisaged that where suitable school accommodation is identified and confirmed, appropriate supports, including financial assistance, will be made available to bring the additional capacity on stream as quickly as possible. In this regard, consultations are under way with other Government Departments and agencies with responsibility in this area, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has primary responsibility for the development and <Col N="714" /> implementation of appropriate strategies in relation to child care provision. I will make any necessary arrangements to support the advancement of Government policy in relation to child care and, in particular, to increase the number of child care places through the use of spare school classrooms for this purpose.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if any schools in County Meath were included in the recent survey on radon gas levels; the results of such survey; and the arrangements to carry out remedial measures in these schools to ensure that there is no health risk from radon to students or teachers.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1271/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &ndash; RPII &ndash; to conduct a survey of radon levels in schools in 1998. All schools recognised by my Department were invited to participate. The survey is being conducted in three phases. The results of phase one of the survey were released to the participating schools in January 2000. Schools in County Meath were invited to participate in phase one of the survey.</P>
      <P>In May last year the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000, (Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000) gave effect to the most recent revision of the EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive (Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM). This sets a national reference level for radon in workplaces of 400 bqMf7&gt;3 over any three month period. If radon exceeds this level an employer must evaluate whether remedial measures should be undertaken and, if so, such measures should be undertaken as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>Mitigation measures are complete in 13 of the worst affected schools, including two schools in County Meath, that participated in phase one of the survey and post-mitigation testing indicates that the measures taken have been effective. Contracts have been placed to carry out remedial work in a further 20 schools from phase one.</P>
      <P>In November last year, the results of phase two of the survey were released to schools in the counties participating in that phase. Phase three of the survey is under way at present and the results are expected late this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RPII advised that 23 of the worst affected schools who participated in phase two should be given priority when mitigation arrangements were being made. An expert in radon mitigation from Cornwall County Council visited ten of these schools in order to draw up specifications for mitigation systems. He will visit the remaining 13 schools in March and May this year. The specifications will be available to enable the systems to be installed in all 23 schools by the summer of this year at the very latest. Arrangements are also being made to have remedial work carried out in <Col N="715" /> another 51 schools with maximum radon levels in one or more rooms in a range between 404 bqMf7&gt;3 and 656 bqMf7&gt;3. It is hoped that more local expertise can be found to specify the remedial measures necessary in these schools.</P>
    <P>My Department had previously set a reference level of 200 bqMf7&gt;3 above which remedial measures to mitigate radon levels would be undertaken. This reference level was the same as that above which the Government, in 1990, advised that mitigation measures should be considered in domestic dwellings.</P>
    <P>A pilot study of the natural ventilation in ten schools with maximum radon levels of between 200bqMf7&gt;3 and 400bqMf7&gt;3 is under way at present. The purpose of the study is to establish whether passive ventilation systems can be used to mitigate radon levels in this range, as opposed to the mechanical systems that have been, or are in the process of being, installed in the schools with higher levels. The results of the study are expected this month. These will allow my Department to plan a mitigation programme for the schools with maximum radon levels in excess of 200bqMf7&gt;3, but not exceeding 400bqMf7&gt;3. Meanwhile, my Department is advising schools that increasing the natural ventilation in affected rooms, where this can be achieved without discomfort to the users of those rooms, may be effective in reducing the level of radon.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 320 at 30 September 1999. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2000, on which the staffing for the 2001-02 school year is based, was 317. Under the existing staffing schedule, this enrolment would not entitle the school to an additional post for the next school year.</P>

    <P>However, the above school has the option of examining its position in relation to its developing status. The awarding of a developing school post is conditional on a school satisfying specific cri<Col N="719" /> teria, which are outlined annually in a circular to schools.

      <P>Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The school in question is included in the rural dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £1,911 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned. To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources, I am appointing a director of programmes to tackle disadvantage, assisted by a support team. This team will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage and the delivery of targeted supports.</P>
      <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year. Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of resource teachers, the school in question has been allocated ten hours part-time resource support to cater for the educational needs of four pupils enrolled in the school. The school has a remedial teaching post, which it shares with three other local schools. The needs of the pupils in the school in question will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial teaching services.</P>

      <P>I am aware that all schools will derive benefit from the introduction of a psychological service delivered by psychologists with a background in working with school children. This is the reason for the Government's decision to establish the National Educational Psychological Service &ndash; NEPS. The current situation in Sligo is that two educational psychologists have been providing a service to all post-primary schools and a number of primary schools. An additional appointment has now been made to the region, allowing for further expansion in the primary sector in the county. The NEPS development plan envisages that there will be four psychologists serving the Sligo/Leitrim area by the end of the year 2003.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that have been experienced by some schools in gaining access to psychological assessments. This is why I provided an extra 28 psychologists since last summer. This situation will continue for a period of time, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists for NEPS. In the interests of equity of access, my Department, in collaboration with the management of NEPS, is currently considering possible short-term strategies to alleviate the situation.</P>

      <P>The number of hearing impaired students who are completely dependent on Irish sign language for communication purposes is quite small and they are being educated either in special classes or in special schools for the deaf. Were these students to be educated in mainstream settings, the degree of dispersal involved would be such that the maintenance of the particular culture that is crucially important in their lives would be extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for hearing people to learn Irish sign language unless they are regularly in a deaf community, immersed in deaf culture, regularly in the company of deaf Irish sign language users and provided with ample opportunities both to learn and use Irish sign language in situations calling for real and meaningful communication.

As an interim measure in response to the shortage of speech <Col N="728" /> and language therapists, the intake into the programme at Trinity College, Dublin, has been increased to 29 for the current academic year. My Department is continuing to liaise with the Department of Health and Children on this matter and will give positive consideration to any recommendations in relation to the training of additional speech therapists which may arise from the review to ensure that adequate services are available to all children within the school system who require them.</P>

In line with a Government decision to reduce the number of participants in CE schemes, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in that Department regarding this issue. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department.</P>
      <P>Officials are preparing proposals for the transfer of such funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to my Department at present. Once those proposals are finalised, consultations with the social partners, in accordance with Framework IV of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will be arranged under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the effects of a transfer of funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to my Department would be to remove the anomalies that exist at present in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools. For example, certain schools currently have the benefit of secretarial and caretaking services under CE schemes and also receive a grant for such services from my <Col N="729" /> Department, whereas other schools are solely dependent on the grants that are issued by my Department. The purpose of the discussions that are taking place is to transfer full responsibility for the funding of schools for secretarial and caretaking services to my Department which would ensure a uniform and equitable system of funding for such services.</P>

      <P>Grant-in-aid financial assistance is made available by my Department to support the provision of youth work services at national and local level under the terms of a number of youth work schemes. Such schemes administered by vocational education committees involve support for (f2&gt;a) youth information centres; (f2&gt;b) special projects to assist disadvantaged young people; and (f2&gt;c) the local youth club grant scheme. The financial provision allocated to vocational education committees in respect of these schemes in 2000 was as follows: (f2&gt;a) £306,251; (f2&gt;b) £5,302,917; and (f2&gt;c) £1,130,000.</P>
      <P>Allocations for these schemes for 2001 have not yet been determined and it is not possible, therefore, at this stage to indicate the amount that will be provided through the vocational education committees this year. The Youth Work Bill, 2000, envisages that the vocational education committees will have an increased role in youth work. My Department is also engaged in the preparation of a five year national youth work development plan. Due consideration will be given to the administration of the schemes, including the role of the vocational education committees, in the implementation of the Bill and the plan.</P>

      <P>The senior psychologist in the National Educational Psychological Service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; with responsibility for County Mayo carried out an investigation of the needs of the named student at the beginning of the current school year. He found that a full psychological assessment had been carried out by a clinical psychologist on 10 January 2000. As the student's mother had provided a copy of the psychological report, the NEPS psychologist did not feel it was necessary to carry out a further assessment.</P>
      <P>However, the NEPS psychologist has monitored the student's progress through discussions with his parents and with the school authorities on a number of occasions. The student has been granted an exemption from the study of Irish and has received additional literacy classes in school. More recently, in response to an application for additional resources in respect of a number of students in the school, the NEPS psychologist has recommended, with the agreement of the senior inspector, that the student shares an extra literacy class per week with another first year pupil.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1197, 1212, 1217, 1221, 1222, 1224 and 1242 together.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister for Education and Science, I set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority. The Deputies will be aware that earlier this month I launched a major new programme to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March/April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need and all schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Educational Research Centre's records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in the new programme was not received <Col N="732" /> from the individual schools referred to by the Deputies. Naturally, in the absence of a completed survey form relating to any of the schools in question, the ERC was unable to assess the level of concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage in relation to these schools. Where individual schools did not participate in the survey, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances in relation to educational disadvantage. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be further considered.</P>

      <P>Exemption from the study of Irish may be granted to primary pupils under certain circumstances outlined in Department Circular 12/96. Copies of this circular are available on request from primary administration section 1, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> Under the terms of Circular 12/96 delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down in the circular, has been vested in the individual school authority. In the case referred to by the Deputy, if the school authority is refusing to grant an exemption which is warranted under the terms of the circular, the matter can be brought to the attention of primary administration section. However the matter should in the first instance be raised with the school in question.</P>

      <P>Schools participating in the new pro<Col N="737" /> gramme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The school in question is included in the rural dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £1,189 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned. To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources, I am appointing a director of programmes to tackle disadvantage, assisted by a support team. This team will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage and the delivery of targeted supports.</P>
      <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the educational research centre for my Department last year. Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of this particular school is a principal and two mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 82 as at 30 September 1999. This school was one pupil short of the retention figure for the third teaching post last year, hence the drop in staffing numbers to principal and two teachers. Unfortunately, the agreed staffing schedule must be adhered to and I cannot therefore sanction an additional post on that basis.</P>

      <P>In March 2000, my Department issued a circular to all primary schools advising them of the new programme and that a comprehensive survey of educational disadvantage in schools would be undertaken by the educational research centre in the near future. The ERC issued a questionnaire together with relevant instructions to primary schools in April and this was followed up by a further letter to schools in May requesting them to submit their completed questionnaires. Participation in the survey was not obligatory and over 75% of schools completed and returned questionnaires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All normal procedures were followed to ensure that information concerning the programme reached all primary schools. Where schools allege <Col N="740" /> that they did not receive any of the communications issued, it is open to them to make a submission to me outlining their circumstances in relation to educational disadvantage. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be further considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 2000, my Department allocated information technology grants of £700 under the IT2000 project to all schools which have the service of a full-time learning support and-or resource teacher. This funding was intended to facilitate the purchase of relevant hardware-software items by the teachers in question to assist them in catering for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the context of last December's budget, I secured an additional allocation of £1.75 million to fund the purchase of computers and computer aids for children with special needs in special schools, special classes and in integrated settings. This brings the total funding available in this area to £2.737 million and represents an increase of more than 100%.</P>
      <P>Since 1998, all publicly funded first and second level schools have received funding for the purchase of computer equipment under the IT 2000 project. In addition, when learning support and resource teaching posts are allocated to primary schools an initial equipment grant of £500 is allocated and this is followed by an annual grant of £250.</P>
      <P>The above developments demonstrate my commitment to ensuring that our special needs children have ready access to the benefits of modern technology within the education system. The Deputy may have noted also that I recently, on 4 January, launched a pilot scheme to provide laptops and software to second year pupils with dyslexia or other learning difficulties in 31 second level schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1236 and 1238 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available to my Department. As the Deputy will appreciate, third level institutions offer a diverse range of scholarships funded from a variety of sources, including from their own resources and from private donations.</P>
      <P>Under the programme for research in third level institutions, which is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund, third level institutions compete for funding for institutional research programmes. These programmes can include the awarding by the colleges of post-graduate scholarships. A total of 236 such awards have been made since the launch of the first cycle of the programme in 1999. The<i> per capita</i> amount awarded for scholarships varies according to institution and field of study.</P>
      <P>Some 49 post-graduate scholarships were awarded in 2000 under the post-graduate R&amp;D skills development initiative in the technological sector. These scholarships are valued at some £7,000 annually.</P>
      <P>Government of Ireland research scholarships are awarded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences. More than 200 postgraduate scholarships have been awarded by the council since its establishment in 1998, including 93 awards for the academic year 2000-2001. These awards attract a maintenance allowance of £8,000 per annum for a maximum of three years.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the establishment of the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. The new council will be putting in place, within these fields of study, similar post-graduate scholarship arrangements to those applying in the humanities and social science areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>The clause in question states that a can<Col N="745" /> didate shall not be eligible to hold a higher education grant if s/he holds: (i) scholarship-grant awarded by either a VEC or the Department of Education and Science; (ii) any other award payable from public funds; or (iii) the equivalent of (i) or (ii) from another EU member state. There is a similar provision in the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme.</P>
      <P>The provisions at (ii) or (iii) above do not include awards such as scholarships, prizes or bursaries, made by the institution being attended or postgraduate research grants, where the grant received does not exceed a specified amount, which for the 2000-01 academic year, is IR£5,000. An exception to this IR£5,000 limit is being applied for the 2000-01 academic year in the case of students holding a Government of Ireland research scholarship, awarded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences. The local authorities and vocational education committees, which administer the schemes of student support, have been informed accordingly.</P>
      <P>In line with normal practice, my Department will be reviewing the provisions of the student support schemes when drafting the schemes for the 2001-02 academic year. The limit of £5,000, cited in clause 2.2 of the higher education grants scheme, will be reviewed in this context.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency does not yet provide a psychological service to primary schools in County Westmeath. At present, the psychological assessment service there is provided by the relevant health board or by voluntary bodies under its aegis.</P>
      <P>It is, however, the intention of NEPS to provide such a service as soon as a suitably qualified psychologist is available to work in the area. Additional psychologists will be appointed during the current school year and County Westmeath has been identified as a high priority in the development programme of NEPS.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that have been experienced by some schools, including the school named by the Deputy, in gaining access to psychological assessments, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists for NEPS. I have therefore asked NEPS to develop a short-term strategy to alleviate the situation and I expect this to be in place shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the reason further to a letter from Deputy Gerard Reynolds of 19 September 2000 and an acknowledgement from his private secretary, dated 29 September 2000, Deputy Reynolds has not received a complete reply to his query since that date, regarding application for third level grants for persons (details supplied) in County Leitrim.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department receives a large volume of correspondence, including representations from members of the Oireachtas and other public representatives. The overall aim would be to reply within a period of 21 days to correspondence and if this cannot be done, to issue an acknowledgement.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's representations relate to the case of two applications for grant assistance from members of the same family, one of whom applied to County Leitrim VEC for a third level maintenance grant for trainees &ndash; TLT &ndash; and one candidate who applied to Leitrim County Council for a higher education grant.</P>
      <P>With regard to the application for a TLT grant, a query in respect of the reckonable income limit to be applied was received by my Department from County Leitrim VEC on 15 September 2000. Every effort is made by my officials to respond promptly to such queries, to avoid unnecessary delay in the processing of applications for grant assistance. While, in the case in question, a reply issued to County Leitrim VEC on 25 September 2000, and was subsequently copied to Leitrim County Council, I regret that due to the volume of correspondence on hand and an oversight, a response to the Deputy's representations on the matter did not issue.</P>
      <P>The query in this case related to the assessment of reckonable income. Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, a candidate's reckonable income, for the purposes of the means test, is his/her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his-her parents or guardians where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt.</P>
      <P>County Leitrim VEC, which is responsible for the assessment of means in the case of applications for a TLT grant, sought a direction from my Department as to whether or not the interest on borrowing for capital expenditure could be offset against reckonable income for grants purposes.</P>
      <P>Interest on borrowing for capital expenditure purposes is not deductible in computing reckonable income for grant purposes and, accordingly, the interest on capital expenditure borrowing must be included as reckonable income for purposes of the grants schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that, in the light of this direction from my Department, the reckonable income in these two cases exceeds the current income limits for the award of a grant in respect of the <Col N="753" /> 2000-01 academic year, under the terms of the student support schemes.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of the student support schemes are of general application and it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the campus at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, which extends to approximately 60 acres, accommodates three centres for young offenders; Trinity House, Oberstown Boys Centre and Oberstown Girls Centre. Trinity House is already enclosed by a secure fence. The balance of the site which contains Oberstown Boys and Girls Centres and four houses associated with the centres will be enclosed by the new fence.</P>
      <P>Tenders for the construction of the fence, associated landscaping works and access upgrading were recently invited. The tender report is currently being prepared by the design team and my Department expects to award the contract in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Lusk Community Council, representing the local community, had a number of meetings with officials of my Department and the directors of the centres regarding the proposed fence. Details of the plans were on public display at the Oberstown Centre and in the Department's office in Marlborough Street from 31 August 2000 for one month, as required by the planning and development regulations.</P>
      <P>The proposed fence will be three metres high along the boundary fronting the main road and 3.5 metres high around the east, west and northern boundaries and will extend in length to 2.5 kilometres approximately.</P>
      <P>The cost of the proposed works is not expected to exceed £1.5 million and the project is scheduled for completion in six months. The proposed expansion of the services provided in Trinity-Oberstown complexes includes: the development of a highly specialised secure unit on the campus at Lusk to cater for six children; the architectural planning is at an advanced stage and documents will shortly be lodged with the planning authority and also be put on display at the centre.

      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of special needs in primary schools. The preparation of teachers at pre-service level to work with pupils with special needs is one of the issues being addressed by the working group on primary pre-service teacher education.</P>
      <P>Six week-long training courses have been run for resource teachers over the past year as part of in-service training. These courses have been located at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra; Mary Immaculate College, Limerick and St. Angela's College, Sligo. To date, 180 resource teachers have availed of these in-service courses. Further training programmes are planned for the future.</P>

    <P>Resource teacher support is allocated to address the special educational needs of children with disabilities attending ordinary schools on a <Col N="762" /> fully integrated basis. The level of support provided in each case is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and has regard to the prevailing pupil teacher ratio applicable to the particular disability category involved.</P>
    <P>Resource teacher support is allocated on a full-time or part-time basis, depending on the number of children involved in a local area and the level of their special needs. The criteria applicable to the allocation of resource teacher support were notified to national schools in a circular issued by my Department in April, 1999. My Department is continuing to allocate resource teacher support in response to identified needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary school curriculum outlines content and objectives for each curricular area and for all class levels. The curriculum recognises <Col N="763" /> the uniqueness of the child and the importance of developing the full potential of each individual. While content and objectives are outlined for pupils in senior classes, due allowance for individual differences, a key principle of the curriculum, is stressed. Consequently, a single set of targets and objectives to be achieved by all pupils leaving primary schools is not set.</P>
      <P>One of the functions of primary education is to prepare children for education at second level, and the importance of this function is emphasised in the general aims of the revised primary curriculum. These general aims refer to the importance of ensuring consistency of approach between the primary curriculum and the junior cycle curricula, and the importance of communication between schools at both levels.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that primary schools and teachers, in implementing these aims, will ensure that all relevant information on pupil achievement is conveyed to their counterparts at second level. The present approach to assessment at primary level is that a mixture of teacher-designed and standardised tests is given to pupils, including those leaving primary schools. Some schools also compile portfolios of each pupil's work. Practical arrangements for the transfer of information on pupils and the level of that information are matters that are left to the managements and staffs of primary and second-level schools at local level. In addition, I would encourage all parents and guardians whose children may be encountering educational problems to bring their concerns to the attention of the school authorities when enrolling children at second level.</P>
      <P>A significant feature of the primary school curriculum is the central position given to assessment in the teaching and learning process. Each subject in the curriculum contains a statement on appropriate assessment procedures and their use. The vast majority of primary schools use standardised, norm-referenced tests from first class onwards. Such tests identify pupils with difficulties and low achievements in literacy and mathematics. Pupils so identified are referred to the learning support teacher for further diagnostic testing and remedial teaching. Pupils with more serious difficulties are referred for psychological assessment. I am satisfied that in these ways educational problems are being identified earlier than in the past and that steps are being taken to deal effectively with them.</P>

      <P>The modern languages (primary) pilot project began in September 1998, in the fifth and sixth classes of approximately 270 schools. The pilot phase of the programme was due to end in June 2000. I have decided to continue the pilot phase for a further year.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 312 schools involved in the project. Of these, 147 offer French, 82 offer German, 58 offer Spanish and 25 offer Italian.</P>
      <P>The NCCA appointed an education officer in autumn 1998 to develop curriculum and teacher guidelines for schools involved in this project. The curriculum guidelines have issued to all schools involved. Work is nearing completion on the teacher guidelines and it is expected that they will issue to schools involved in the project before the end of this school year. The emphasis of the curriculum guidelines is on a communicative approach and links have been identified between the teaching of modern languages and other areas of the revised primary curriculum. Extensive teaching materials have been devised and presented to the project teachers by the seven project leaders who are responsible for the in-service aspect of the pilot project.</P>
      <P>I would add that, while the teaching of modern languages does not form part of the primary curriculum, the discretionary curriculum time provided for in the revised primary curriculum allows schools to include a modern language where it is available.</P>
      <P>Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann (ITÉ) is responsible for the evaluation of the project. ITÉ has employed a dedicated evaluator for the project since autumn 1998. The evaluation has run in parallel with the development of the project. The first report of this evaluation will shortly be available. I will consider the future development of modern languages in primary schools following receipt of the evaluation report.</P>

      <P>Specific measures have been taken at both primary and post-primary levels to inform schoolchildren of the dangers of drugs and substance abuse.</P>
      <P>The programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools, Walk Tall, was developed by my Department in consultation with the partners in education and other relevant interests. This development took place in a small number of primary schools during the school years 1996-97 and 1997-98 and the programme received a positive independent evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> The dissemination of the programme's detailed educational resource materials to primary schools and the delivery of a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers commenced in January 1999, with a two-year completion target. The programme has now been introduced to 2787 primary schools and it is expected that 3000 schools, 94%, will have accessed support by the end of the June 2001. Funding of £575,522 has been provided to support this work to date.</P>
    <P>At second level, the substance misuse prevention programme, On My Own Two Feet, has been introduced in approximately 570 post-primary schools &ndash; 75%. A sum of £50,000 will be spent on this programme in 2001. The Department of Health and Children also provides significant additional funding. The dissemination of this programme commenced in early 1995 and has continued each year since.</P>
    <P>Since September 2000, social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; including substance misuse prevention education, is being phased in to all schools at junior cycle over a three year period. In this context a support service for SPHE, including a national co-ordinator and ten regional development officers, was put in place in September 2000. This service will work in partnership with health promotion personnel in regional health boards.</P>

      <P>I met with representatives of interested parties in Kilkenny at the end of August to discuss the further development of the outreach service in the city. My Department forwarded a detailed proposal from NUI Maynooth on a strategic plan for development of Kilkenny outreach campus to the Higher Education Authority and the authority has been discussing the proposal with the university, including the issue of the staffing involved. The Higher Education Authority has now provided its advice to my Department on the outcome of these discussions and my officials are considering the proposals, including the appointment of a director, in the light of the authority's advice. I confirm that the Higher Education Authority allocated £150,000 in December 2000 towards the cost of the project.</P>

      <P>The ex-quota allocations to individual second level schools in respect of remedial education and guidance for a particular school year are determined by the enrolment in the school at the end of the preceding September.</P>
      <P>With regard to remedial education, all schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education since the beginning of the 1999/00 school year. The general position is that schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post; schools with enrolments below 600 pupils are allocated 0.5 of a post. However, schools with enrolments below 600 which were specifically allocated a full post in respect of remedial education by my Department prior to the 1999/00 school year retain their entitlement to an allocation of a full post.</P>
      <P>In the case of guidance, the allocation varies between two wholetime teacher equivalents, 44 hours per week, in the case of schools with enrolments of 1,000 or more pupils, to a minimum allocation of 0.36 wholetime teacher equivalents, eight hours per week, in the case of schools with less than 200 pupils.</P>
      <P>In the school year 2000/01 the ex-quota allocations to second level schools in County Meath in respect of remedial education and guidance are 14 wholetime teacher equivalents and 13.94 wholetime teacher equivalents respectively.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing the ex-quota allocations in respect of remedial education and guidance will be considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the report of the expert group on teacher allocations which is expected to be available in the near future.</P>

      <P>To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources now being provided, I am appointing a director of programmes to tackle disadvantage, assisted by a support team. This team will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage and the delivery of targeted supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year. Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey <Col N="780" /> in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>
