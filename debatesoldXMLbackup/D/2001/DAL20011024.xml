      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputy Joe Higgins and Deputy Jim Higgins.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of crucial public importance, namely, the disastrous decision by the Government to sell 35% of Aer Lingus to private concerns and the need to secure a different policy of State investment in the national airline to avoid 2,000 job losses and develop the company as a secure entity.</P>

        <b>:</b> I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter requiring consideration, namely, the decision by the Government to sell 35% of Aer Lingus in spite of previous Government assurances that privatisation of the company was off the agenda for the foreseeable future; the loss of 2,026 jobs at the company and the devastating consequences for the employees involved, their families and the future of the national carrier.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business will be No. 53, Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Report and Final Stages (resumed); No. 52, Family Support Agency Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed), to be taken not later than 12.15 p.m. and the order shall resume thereafter; No. 7, Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken immediately following the announcement of matters under Standing Order 21.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 52 shall be taken not later than 12.15 p.m. and, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. and the order shall resume thereafter; and (2) Question Time tomorrow shall be taken at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a private notice question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 52, the conclusion of Second Stage of the Family Support Agency Bill, 2001, agreed to? Agreed.

      <P>Sula chuirim ceist ar an dTaoiseach ba mhaith liom fáiltiú roimh lucht féachana TG4 agus tréaslú le bainistíocht an stáisiún lán Ghaelaigh sin as ucht an tseans atá tugtha aige do mhuintir na hÉireann cúrsaí agus díospóireachtaí na Dála a fheiscint. Tá súil agam go n-aontaíonn gach éinne leis sin. Against the background of yesterday's events, especially the statement by General de Chastelain's commission, Fine Gael welcomes what is an historic report. We are very supportive of the decision that the IRA is putting weapons permanently beyond use. We all share <Col N="1439" /> the hope that this breakthrough will lead to the full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and that the Agreement will become the Good Friday settlement for the next generation. Does the Taoiseach agree that those loyalist paramilitary organisations which are no longer officially engaged in a ceasefire should be immediately encouraged to resume their ceasefires as a first step to putting their weapons beyond use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on Deputy Quinn to ask a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the viewers of TG4 to the Order of Business. I hope the management of TG4 will extend coverage to the Forum on Europe in Dublin Castle and the committees of the House. We owe a debt to TG4 in that respect, although the same could be said of it owing a debt to the House having regard to the amount of money voted by the House to underwrite its costs.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the concern of many for the Nationalist people living in the Ardoyne due to the trouble they continue to experience? Trouble is actually far too mild a word to describe the daily harassment young children are still experiencing. It behoves all in Northern Ireland, particularly the RUC, to ensure that this level of sectarian harassment is eliminated on the streets of any village, town or city in Northern Ireland. That would remove any residual reliance upon paramilitaries to provide protection for communities. It has no place in the new Ireland. Can the Taoiseach ensure that over the next 48 hours of the ongoing discussions attention will focus on the fears of people living in certain isolated communities, be they loyalists or Nationalists? Those fears must be dealt with effectively by the legitimate forces of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for his positive remarks and the House for its support during this effort. Through all the Question Times on this issue the House has been positive in its support of the efforts to achieve what was accomplished yesterday. It is appreciated. We would probably not have had this success without a united House. <Col N="1440" /> There was no way for people to ignore the hard realities of this issue.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome what was achieved yesterday. It provides an opportunity for movement. It is almost a year to the week since the institutions ran into difficulties. It was on the Saturday of the bank holiday weekend last year that we encountered the problem of the exclusion of Sinn Féin Ministers from the North-South bodies, which led to the tension that followed. We must now move quickly to get the institutions working. The assembly is operating and will continue to do so and the Executive will put the First Minister and his Ministers back in position. The North-South bodies also have to be put back to work very speedily. I hope that will be done over the next day or two. We will be in talks to make sure it happens.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous amount of activity by loyalists this summer and it has continued into the autumn. The pipe bomb attacks which have become synonymous with loyalists have continued to occur practically every day and right up until recent days. I hope they will desist from that activity. In many of the difficult areas it is putting pressure on individuals to respond. My attention is daily directed to the fact that members of the paramilitary groups on ceasefire have been attacked and criticised by their communities for not responding. They are being taunted to respond, but thankfully they have not done so. The best way to move on is for the loyalists to join in the ceasefire and for those who have control to get them to desist from these activities. I also hope the recent action by the Secretary of State in coming down on the loyalist groups will have some effect. We all want to see their leadership stop the violence and get on with the peace process.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity to meet Father Aidan Troy last week and there is no doubt that the actions at the Holy Faith School in the Ardoyne are extraordinary. Every morning and evening a huge number of RUC officers have to move into the area. They go through the daily ritual whereby everybody takes up positions, which would be laughable if it were not so serious. However, the people affected are small children and they and their parents are terrified. Everybody else is terrified. Every morning everybody does exactly the same thing. People have told me that it has become part of the ritual of their day, with the same actions and scenes being repeated, except for the violent incidents which happen every so often. It is far more serious than mere ritual because these children cry through this every morning. Before it starts they are playing and dancing, but then the ritual begins and they are terrorised. They get to school and it takes them an hour to settle. A number of the children have had stress and trauma problems in recent weeks. While adults can perhaps take this &ndash; though I am not so sure that is true &ndash; children cannot. I take the opportunity provided by Deputy Quinn's questions to appeal to people to <Col N="1441" /> stop it. The parents cannot back down and they will not back down. Only a small number of children have left the school and the rest will stick with it. It has nothing to do with solving the problem of paramilitary groups. Father Troy is doing his best and is prepared to talk to anybody in the Glenbryn estate and elsewhere to find a resolution. The success of yesterday gives people an opportunity to think and to stop these actions as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in this House have heard the word &ldquo;historic&rdquo; being used from time to time. It is probably much abused, but yesterday was historic. It would be appropriate to mark such an historic event by providing information to the House by way of debate or statement. There is to be a debate on the matter in the House of Commons today and this House should mark the historic occasion by at least having statements if not a full debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not press the issue with a view to contention but I ask the Taoiseach to initiate discussions among the Whips after the Order of Business to see if it is possible to have statements commencing at about 4.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has this Government effectively sabotaged the viability of Aer Lingus over the past four and a half years? Why has it changed its political direction on, and attitude to, the airline? Why did it have Aer Lingus up for sale, withdraw the Bill to provide for the floatation and then change its mind again? Why has the Government signally failed to raise this matter in a meaningful way at the informal Council in Ghent last week? Why has the crisis in Aer Lingus not rated the same level of priority as far lesser issues which have demanded so much of the Taoiseach's personal time and attention? Why is one of the only island states of the European Union being directed by an ideologically driven Commission? The Commission is interpreting the rules in the most rigid way and in some cases misinterpreting Article 87 or 92. Why has this Government capitulated so spectacularly to the bureaucratic pressures of the Commission and we now have a forced fire sale of 35% of the equity of Aer Lingus? That sends a clear signal to everyone that this proud State company is now a wounded bird ready to be picked up by anybody who has the money to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Government's decision to sell 35% of Aer Lingus is a clear manifestation of its failure to persuade the Commission to allow it to put equity into the airline through guaranteed loans to secure its future? Is it not amazing that the government in the United States, which has the most liberal <Col N="1442" /> economic philosophy, can underpin its aviation industry? The European Commission and the Irish Government run up the white flag and allow the terrorists to take another trophy &ndash; the destruction of Aer Lingus &ndash; after the destruction they visited upon the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government did nothing for two and a half years when Aer Lingus was getting into increasing difficulty. The cataclysmic events of 11 September have brought about the forced sale or fire sale of the airline because the Government has no other strategy.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has very little influence in Europe now, but he and the Government should think again. We will support him on this side of the House in getting the Commission to put equity into Aer Lingus and not sell it in the current circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is endeavouring to help Aer Lingus manage itself through the very stark difficulties it currently faces. In the early months of this year, Aer Lingus was in the news because it was in a financial position to give substantive increases to various members of staff. It looked as if it would have a healthy year. That changed during the summer and, certainly, the outlook became even worse after the events of 11 September.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, we had an hour and 40 minutes of questions to the Minister for Public Enterprise. I do not want to cover that ground again, but the objective of the Government is to save the company. We do not want to see it go into receivership, examinership, or liquidation. We want to see the company saved with a maximum amount of jobs in the future and we want to maintain its viability. We will keep the lines of communication with the EU Commission open, although we understand the rules. We do not want to be in a position where Aer Lingus will get limited aid from the EU Commission and have to go into receivership to do that, nor do we want to have to proceed through courts only to find the company in such difficulty that it will have to sell anyway in a month's time without having solved anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any package we negotiate with the Commission will have to ensure the viability of the company. If we give State aid in a manner that does not conform to the rules, one would have to wait for more than a year as the company continued to haemorrhage. It is losing £15 million per week, £2 million a day. It is important to save and protect the company for the future and sustain as many jobs as we can. We have to look at all options. The Minister for Public Enterprise made it clear yesterday that one of those options is to see if we can get a strategic partner alliance and have somebody invest equity in the company. It is the right thing to do for the short term and, probably, the long term. We will see if this is <Col N="1443" /> possible. The Minister for Public Enterprise has written to the chairman of Aer Lingus requesting him to pursue the stated investment course of action and the internal negotiations within the company. We also want to look after the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 87 of the European Community Treaty states explicitly that State aid is <Col N="1444" /> permissible in certain sets of circumstances. Paragraph 2(b) states that aid can be granted &ldquo;to make good the damage caused by natural disasters&rdquo;. What else was foot and mouth disease? It states can also be given in &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;. What else were the events of 11 September?</P>
      <P>The Government has failed spectacularly through political incompetence and a lack of political friendship in the Council of Europe to insist with the Commission that, in the present circumstances, State aid is warranted to restructure Aer Lingus, without confusing the issue with forced privatisation in the manner of the right-wing ideologues in the European Commission. Why has the Taoiseach submitted to the terrorism of the European Commission in relation to this issue? Why has he not fought the issue in the courts, if necessary, to restructure Aer Lingus as is needed? The issue should not be confused by weakening the very future of the company by having a fire sale of 35% as the pre-condition imposed by the Commission. It is not necessary under the interpretation of Article 87, paragraph 2(b) of the treaty. The Government has run up the white flag in submission to this because it is without friends in Europe.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach took decisions in Ghent which involved representations from this House. Yet, he is refusing to report to the House, in breach of the practice and precedent of dealing with clearly planned informal summits in spring and in autumn. I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider his position and to make suitable arrangements, either tomorrow or early next week, so we can have normal reporting of an informal summit, which has been the custom in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 10 to 17, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In the case of a part-time employee placed by a temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise, the comparator worker shall be a comparable full-time employee in the user enterprise.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The non-discrimination clause of the EU part-time work directive is the key provision aimed at ensuring that part-time workers are not discriminated against by virtue of being that. The need for equal treatment for agency workers employed on a part-time basis is extremely important. Section 7 as proposed could result in an agency worker never having another comparator worker in the enterprise where he or she is performing like work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was unable to attend Committee Stage, as I explained, but looking at the report, it is not apparent that this matter was teased out yet it goes to the heart of this Bill. If agency workers are effectively excluded from the Bill's benefits then it is a major loophole that must be addressed. This amendment seeks to address a serious injustice and to close off this loophole, which will be exploited by a certain kind of employer. Agency workers are excluded because the full-time comparator is another agency worker, rather than full-time colleagues in the enterprise where he or she works. A person placed by an agency to carry out secretarial functions will be compared with another agency worker and not one in the same enterprise. There is nothing to prevent an arrangement between an agency and an enterprise whereby many of those working there would avoid the benefits of the <Col N="1452" /> Bill. This section means that an agency worker would not ever have another worker to compare with in the factory or enterprise where he or she earns a livelihood. What protection will a part-time agency worker have when working in an enterprise other than an agency?</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister held out the prospect of an EU directive in preparation which would address this question. That is a remote prospect, and even if it materialises, it will be at least three or four years away. At the rate that we translate European legislation into law, it will be much longer in coming. In the interim we are stuck with the current situation with no guarantee that the problem identified here will be addressed. A difficulty with this Bill is that it departs from the definitions of the directive which it seeks to implement. I cannot see how section 7(4) can be read in any fashion other than that an agency worker is excluded. If the relevant part-time employee is an agency worker then the application of subsection (3) shall not result in any employee, other than another agency worker, being regarded for the purposes of this Part as a comparable employee. In other words, in simple English, what this means is that the comparison for the agency worker is another agency worker. It is a worker doing like or similar work in the enterprise and, therefore, I cannot see the benefit in this Bill for an agency worker. The Minister gave figures on Second Stage suggesting there are more than 300,000 designated part-time workers. It would be interesting to know what proportion of that number are agency workers. I suspect quite a few are agency workers.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the Tánaiste who referred to the manner in which agency workers are coming to Ireland to work in various jobs and professions. Their rights are not protected. We have actively gone out to bring in agency workers to certain areas where there is a skills or a labour shortage and they are refused cover by this Bill. I cannot see how whatever discussion took place on Committee Stage addresses this problem. Clause 3 of the EU directive on part-time work defines the term &ldquo;part-time worker&rdquo; as an employee whose normal hours of work are less than the normal hours of work of a comparable full-time worker. The Minister of State has insisted on putting a far more convoluted definition into the Bill. This is a phenomenon that is growing in our society. There has been a phenomenal increase in atypical working and part-time working in recent years, on which the Minister provided figures on Second Stage. In the past three or four years those figures have dramatically increased. That, I suspect, is partly because of the greater uptake in the work force of women workers who also have domestic responsibilities and to whom part-time work is suited. Therefore, a high proportion of these <Col N="1453" /> employees are women. This Bill as it stands discriminates against female workers.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this amendment. I do not understand why in section 7 the Minister moved explicitly to include subsection (4), given that he knows the effect of it. Why go out of his way to exclude agency workers? This is a category of worker who has few rights as matters stand. As an economy we have gone out of our way to search for agency workers and we now explicitly put into legislation something that excludes them from the rather limited and modest benefits of the Bill. I do not understand why it is so important to the Minister that this subsection should remain in the Bill. Why can it not be excised and my amendment No. 7 taken on board? Amendment No. 7 is straightforward. Instead of the Minister's subsection (4) it would put in a new subsection (4) which would read:</P>
    <P>In the case of a part-time employee placed by a temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise, the comparator worker shall be a comparable full-time employee in the user enterprise.</P>
    <P>In other words wherever that person is carrying out his or her daily work he or she is allowed to make comparisons with the full-time worker in that enterprise and is not restricted to comparing with the agency because that may have no significance, good, bad or indifferent, for the enterprise where work is being carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte in the definition of &ldquo;part-time employee&rdquo;. The Bill was guillotined through on Committee Stage in an hour and a half, at most, but the Minister of State said he would report back on several points. I hope he will follow through on this commitment.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;part-time employee&rdquo; is very important given the ever changing circumstances in the economy. Part-time employees will become the growth sector. There is a huge demand from employers for part-time employees due to the economies of scale of the services sector which in some cases can generate a 100 hour week. Given job sharing, weekend and evening work is suited to part-time employees who would not be available for full-time employment, it is important that there would be a wide scope definition of &ldquo;parttime employee&rdquo;. The tax implications of employing a person part time should not have far reaching implications on the main taxpayer. The Minister for Finance had agreed in principle that it should be in the interests of people to take up part-time employment. If so, there should be major tax changes to encourage people into the work place. That is not the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte made a case for the agency worker. As we speak, there is a huge growth in agency business although an agency is closing down in Sligo due to the fact that it is not being utilised to the extent anticipated 18 months ago. There has been a huge upsurge in bringing unskilled labour to Ireland. Some 75% of all visa <Col N="1454" /> applications granted have been to unskilled workers. Given the down turn in the economy, particularly in the tourism and services sector, the applications granted have been in the unskilled sector. It is important to ensure we do not have a crisis on hand. People coming here who had been guaranteed jobs have found, in some cases, that those jobs have not materialised. People are now changing from job to job. It is important that there are clear definitions and that those who are coming here get the jobs they had been promised initially. The agency role which has been utilised until now will not be utilised to the same extent in the future due to the crisis which appears to be emerging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I strongly support the detailed points made by Deputy Rabbitte in respect of this issue. What we have here is an exploiter's charter. We have entered a new era in society as far as work practices are concerned. For example, there have been huge increases in the numbers of seasonal and migrant workers. Consequently, there has also been a major increase in the exploitation of workers who find themselves in vulnerable positions. To their credit, some branches of the trade union movement have highlighted the type of abuses visited on these workers by Irish employers in recent years.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister of State is introducing regulations that will suit the exploiter rather than protect the employee. Section 7(4), as drafted, is open to major abuse. It is clear that unscrupulous employers, of whom we have seen many examples in recent years, can use this section to escape having to provide agency workers with proper work conditions, wages, etc. Unfortunately, the Irish economy is in a period of turnaround which will have grave implications for many workers. It is the most vulnerable workers who will again be exploited in circumstances which are becoming more favourable to employers because, under the laws of capitalism, unemployment will begin to rise against a background of recession. Agency, part-time and seasonal workers will be most vulnerable as a result. It is shameful for the Government to give support at this time to the type of machinations practised by employers in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should accept the amendment tabled in the names of Deputies Broughan and Rabbitte. We covered similar ground with the Minister of State in respect of the minimum wage legislation. We had to wrestle with him in respect of a number of issues relating to that legislation, which loaded the dice in favour of employers to the detriment of workers in vulnerable positions. I support the amendment and hope the Government will accede to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for tabling amendment No. 7 and also those Deputies who made contributions in respect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> Amendment No. 7 arises on foot of concerns raised by the ICTU which believes that in the case of a part-time agency employee performing his or her work in an enterprise other than an agency, it should be possible for such an employee to compare himself or herself with a non-agency full-time worker in that enterprise. Negotiations recently took place at EU level between the ETUC, UNICE and CEEP on the issue of temporary agency workers. However, these discussions collapsed because the parties could not agree a definition of &ldquo;agency worker.&rdquo;  The European Commission is proposing to introduce by the end of this year a new directive on agency workers. The first meeting of national experts to discuss the proposal took place on Monday last, 15 October. At that meeting, member states were divided as to whether a temporary agency worker should be able to compare himself or herself with another agency worker or a comparable full-time employee in the user enterprise. In the light of this development the Commission undertook to consider the issue further before publishing the proposed directive which, I understand, will be required to be agreed by the Council of Ministers by qualified majority and also with the European Parliament under the co-decision procedures laid down in the Maastricht treaty.</P>
    <P>The Deputies have raised an important issue in relation to agency workers. However, one would believe from Deputy Higgins's comments that we are not introducing progressive legislation in respect of part-time workers. The underlying message is that this legislation is very much in support of part-time workers. We should not forget this. Deputy Rabbitte acknowledged that there are approximately 250,000 part-time workers awaiting the enactment of this legislation and I am glad the House is co-operating in expediting its passage.</P>
    <P>I do not have in my possession the figures relating to agency workers, but will certainly try to establish the number of such workers in the labour market for Deputy Rabbitte. Many employers are now using agency workers on a longer term basis and it is this fact which led the European Union to address the issue. We must deal with it through the European Union process because all other member states are treating it in the same way. It is a new phenomenon that agency workers are being employed on a longer term basis.</P>
    <P>It is untrue to suggest that agency workers do not have a comparator because they can actually compare their conditions with workers employed with different agencies. Many people like to work as agency workers because in some cases they are happy to work for a morning or an afternoon. Flexibility works both ways and there are many people who enjoy the opportunity to be employed as agency workers.</P>
    <P>Like my counterparts in other European Union countries, I intend to maintain the position which <Col N="1456" /> exists. However, I totally support the need to consider the new directive at EU level and will use my influence to expedite the process in that regard. A number of Members raised matters in relation to the directive and I can inform them that there may be opportunities to compromise, as often happens when one is dealing with employers and employees and their representatives at EU level. One suggestion is that, for example, an agency worker who might be with a company for a number of months &ndash; be it three or six months &ndash; could be compared to a permanent worker with the company.</P>
    <P>Members who have been involved in the debate on the Bill are aware that the legislation is about flexibility and encourages employers and employees to try to work through the new type of regime that exists. I want to see flexibility from both sides. However, like other Members, my fundamental concern is to ensure workers are protected. This legislation will protect them and represents a huge improvement on existing law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment refers to a different issue, namely, that of temporary agency workers. The people concerned require particular attention because many of them are now working on a longer term basis for employers. However, many are happy to work so long as they are adequately paid. As already stated, they can compare their conditions with those of workers employed by other agencies. If they so wish, they can take a case, first, to their employer and, second, to a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>I apologise for speaking at length about this issue. I will expedite matters to the best of my ability at EU level. I remind the House that other EU countries are in a similar position to us and that we intend, with our EU colleagues, to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State chooses to pursue this at EU level. Will he not start here? This is an opportunity to set a precedent in Ireland and it is a pity to make comparisons with other agencies. That is inadequate because he is aware of the huge level of competition within such agencies. It is a hugely profitable business and people within the agency circuit are on the stock exchange. The Minister of State has an opportunity to set a precedent here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State has not accepted this amendment as there are defects in the Bill. It also confers benefits but later we will come to a definition that actually worsens the position of some part-time workers in terms of pension entitlements. However, this is the major loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one were to summarise what the Minister of State said, it is: &ldquo;let us wait for Europe&rdquo; and that has been the history of our membership of the European Union. When it comes to workers' rights and equality and non-discrimination issues, the European Union has been the inspiration for the legislation put through this House since for<Col N="1457" /> mer Deputy Michael O'Leary's time. The Minister of State is saying here that we should wait for Europe and that we have started work on a new directive on agency workers which will deal with this.</P>
    <P>Whatever might be concluded down the road on agency workers at EU level, it will be a difficult matter for Europe to agree on for a whole variety of reasons, such as emigrant labour and the extent of agency working in certain countries. As Deputy Perry said, why can we not agree now to take on board a modest measure that would afford the agency worker the opportunity to compare with workers in the same enterprise who are full time? The Minister of State mentioned flexibility and I agree with him &ndash; this ought to be a two-way street and it is true that it suits some workers to be in this category. However, it also suits a great many employers, so it ought to be a two-way street.</P>
    <P>As it stands, this is an invitation to discrimination if it is included. The Minister of State went into the temporary agency phenomenon and we have had a number of cases highlighted of very bad treatment of workers in that category by a minority of employers here. Is the Minister of State prepared to say he will review this phenomenon, which I believe is growing? We will have a long wait for a directive; we will certainly have a very long wait for a directive to be transposed into Irish law on the issue. After 12 months will the Minister of State review this mechanism? He has conceded he does not have figures specifically for agency workers and obviously this has not taken up a great deal of time so far. Some review mechanism might help.</P>
    <P>I will have to press this amendment as this section is a weakness in the Bill. I cannot understand why the Minister of State claims that because work has started in Europe &ndash; and he knows what a long, drawn-out procedure that is &ndash; on a directive for agency workers we will have to wait. Why can we not include this modest measure now and renovate the legislation as necessary when the time comes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Rabbitte's point, which is real and needs to be addressed. I understand it is not just a matter of starting work at the <Col N="1458" /> European level because employers and employees have been discussing it at that level for 11 months. The other argument about the European Union, and I am as committed a European as Deputies Perry and Rabbitte, is that it makes sense for us to have common legislation as members of the EU, with a common employment grouping. People can move around and work in each others' countries, which we appreciated when we recently had a labour shortage. That said, I am prepared to review this matter within a year.</P>
      <P>Also, one suggestion on the table involves looking at temporary agency workers who would be in employment for a number of months in comparison with a permanent worker. That suggestion came from us to the EU so it is not as if we are waiting around for others to come up with bright ideas. One problem is that it is difficult to define an agency worker.</P>
      <P>We are proactively involved at EU level and there are good reasons we should have a common legal position for this type of worker. I am prepared to review the situation as there will be a new Government in place by then. I will certainly make the commitment that this matter be reviewed in 12 months because if we can make advances, and I am conscious that such advances are being made, we should introduce them as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deride the efforts of the Minister of State on this issue. We agreed the day I introduced the first Bill on this issue in the House. I thank the Minister of State for his commitment to review this after 12 months because this is a growing phenomenon.</P>
      <P>This is still the major weakness in the Bill and once the Bill is enacted, with the best will in the world, a new Government will be in place and this will be difficult to revisit in any meaningful way. There is now an opportunity to make the modest substitution for which I am arguing, to replace subsection (4) with the subsection I have outlined. It would be a modest improvement and protection for workers who are very vulnerable by definition. Regrettably I have to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 38 to 42.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to excise subsection 9(4), which provides that the benefits conferred in subsection (1) are constrained. It states:</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) shall, in so far, but only in so far, as it relates to any pension scheme or arrangement, not apply to a part-time employee whose normal hours of work constitute less than 20% of the normal hours of work of a comparable full-time employee.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) effectively excludes those working under eight hours per week from pension scheme rights. The Minister is probably aware that the ICTU, for example, is arguing that this is in breach of the directive which the Bill sets out to implement. They also rightly point out that the section may constitute indirect sex discrimination. It is interesting to look at the quarterly national household survey for the third quarter in 2000, the most recent one available. It shows that three quarters of part-time workers are women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> Some 209,700 women were recorded as part-time workers compared to 68,200 male part-time workers. I suppose Members of the House will not be surprised that three quarters of part-time workers are women. Therefore, there seems to be a <i>prima facie</i> element of discrimination in excluding those working under eight hours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche will collaborate what I am saying. If one works a typical 39 or 40 hour week, eight hours might seem modest enough but if, for example, one has a teaching contract for eight hours it is not to be sneezed at. There are people in full-time university chairs &ndash; I know some of them are burdened writing articles for the Independent group of newspapers &ndash; who do not much more than eight hours full-time teaching contract. I would like to hear the Minister's rationale for this because the directive as I read it does not permit a blanket exclusion as proposed in this section.</P>
    <P>What objective grounds exist for excluding all workers who work less than 20% of normal hours in a week from all pension schemes and arrangements? The Minister went out of his way on Committee Stage, which I read subsequently, to pay tribute to me for suggesting the percentage and proportion rather than the eight hours threshold and so on. One must be very wary when Ministers pay tribute across the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I drew attention to this blanket exclusion I suggested that a proportion or percentage would be an improvement on eight hours, which is the case. While I am pleased the Minister took this on board, it does not tackle the fundamental issue. For example, for the category of workers I mentioned such as part-time teachers, the threshold of 20% of normal time as distinct from eight hours might be an improvement. If the normal comparison with full-time workers applies in that case it certainly could be an improvement. However, this does not tackle the inequity which exists. Congress is of the view that the Bill, for the first time, puts an impediment in the way of workers who already enjoy participation in a pension scheme. There is currently no legal barrier to employees who work less than 20% of normal hours per week joining a pension scheme or arrangement but Congress is of the opinion that this proposal is tantamount to a legal barrier. It is certainly an invitation to employers to discourage workers below that threshold from joining a pension scheme or such an arrangement.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the directive permits a blanket exclusion or that any objective arguments exist for the exclusion of all workers who work less than 20% of normal hours in a week. The Bill provides no objective grounds for this. There are no provisions in the Bill for reviewing periodically this exclusion having regard to the principle of non-discrimination.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Roche and Dennehy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Family Support Agency Bill introduced by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern. The fact that a new statutory body known as the Family Support Agency has been established is very important and another example of the Government's commitment to policy development in regard to the family. While it is an important step, it is sad that we must welcome mediation services and so on. While we would like to think that nothing ever goes wrong with relationships and marriages, it is important that there is encouragement for stability in family life, including measures to address the effects of marital breakdown. The measures being introduced will meet these objectives and will come within the remit of the new agency.</P>
      <P>The fact that the new support agency will provide mediation services throughout the country for couples who have decided to separate and help them to reach amicable agreements in regard to the family home and financial and parenting arrangements is very important. It is also important that the children of such families are included in these mediation measures. We would prefer if mediation was not necessary and that marriage guidance and so on was strengthened. One of the roles of the agency is in marriage preparation programmes, relationship education and parenting information to support families, which is badly needed nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasise the negative role of alcohol in society as a whole and how that leads to trouble. There should be earlier intervention programmes for both adults and children. I welcome the initiatives of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in regard to under age drinking. If we could do more in the area of early intervention perhaps we would reduce the need for mediation. Much of the breakdown, violence within the home and trouble with children can be attributed to one factor. This is not an exclusive one but it has serious implications throughout most cities, towns and villages. I ask the Minister to work with the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State with responsibility for children on the children's strategy, partic<Col N="1463" /> ularly in regard to early intervention and alcohol. While we talk about providing family mediation services throughout the country, I am disappointed that we do not yet have that facility in my own county. I hope that all the supports provided for in this comprehensive Bill will be made available in Donegal. I wish the Bill and the families who will use these services every success. I know these services will have a positive impact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, with Deputy Dennehy. I would be grateful if the Chair would let me know when I have spoken for eight or nine minutes.</P>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation. I would argue strongly that rather than individual functionary focused interventions to support the family there now needs to be some holistic support for families across the agencies. I agree with the previous speaker who suggested that this Minister, Deputy Ahern, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State with responsibility for children should combine their efforts to focus on families, particularly families in crisis.</P>
      <P>This legislation is yet again a fulfilment of a Government's commitment. The aim of the legislation is to support families, promote continuity and stability in family life, prevent breakdown and foster support in a community environment for families at local level, all of which is laudable. I am particularly pleased that the Government has singled out the family resource centres for major improvement and expansion. We have first-hand experience of how valuable these centres can be in County Wicklow where we have two such centres in Bray. The Little Bray Family Resource Centre and the St. Fergal's Resource Centre provide astonishing services and integrate them into the local community. Unlike many official agencies, they are not bound by territoriality so if they need to do something with school children or families, they have the flexibility to do so which State agencies do not.</P>
      <P>While the legislation is welcome, the Minister will know there is a major lacuna in the law of this State which causes not just difficulties for families but, in many cases, pits families who are in difficulty against the State, and the State can have a destructive role. I have in mind the gaps that are now appearing in the implementation of the Children Act, in particular, in regard to care orders and the operation of <i>in camera</i> courts. I hope this new agency will have some capacity to carry out research on the extent of damage being done to families by health agencies who operate illogically and frequently out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is best illustrated by bringing to the attention of the House the case of a young family living not in my constituency but in south County Dublin who were visited by a number of social <Col N="1464" /> workers and gardaí on Christmas Eve, 1996. Their home was entered and their youngest child was removed in conditions of some violence. When the family resisted the removal of the child, batons were drawn and both the mother and father were beaten. That is not acceptable in a civilised country.</P>
    <P>The basis on which this child was taken out of the parents' care has never been made public and will never be made public because the court proceedings took place <i>in camera</i>. The child was removed from the care of the family into the care of the Eastern Health Board for four and a half years. At the end of that time the child was given back to the family without any explanation, apology or effort made to counsel or overcome the difficulties caused.</P>
    <P>Spurious allegations were made about this family. In the intervening period, the family was forced to appear virtually every week in an <i>in camera </i>court to deal with the child's case. A number of allegations were made that were never substantiated or pursued. The most bizarre aspect of this case was that on Christmas Eve two years ago, health board officials arrived with the child in tow, and left the child and all the child's possessions on the doorstep and went away. The family were left in a legal lacuna. For the following two and a half years, the family were forced to go back to the courts week in, week out until two weeks ago when a judge showed common sense and said that the case was a disgrace, that it had been an abuse and he struck it out.</P>
    <P>In the interim four and a half years that family has been through stress which is barely imaginable. Other than the death of a child, having a child forcefully removed must be the most horrific thing that can happen to a family.</P>
    <P>The truly bizarre aspect of this case is that it was the family who went to the health board seeking counselling support and guidance, and brought themselves to the attention of the health board. I would not mind if this were an isolated case, but it is my understanding that up to 1,400 families are currently affected through children being taken into care. The vast majority of those are proper cases and the interventions are correct. Even in this case the health board may well have made an honest mistake at the beginning, but to proceed as they have done is bizarre, and it is not the only bizarre case. There is a case in Donegal where a health board intervened after the birth of the first child and, extraordinarily, after the court had instructed that the first child be given back to the family, officials from the health board presented themselves in the labour ward to remove the second child. That family needed support and intervention, but it did not need devastation. There is a problem here in that demarcation issues will arise relating to who handles these cases.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to create a family support agency. I ask the Minister if this agency could have power to, at a minimum, carry out research into the operation of health boards in <Col N="1465" /> the matter of child care. I know the argument from officials will be that this is primarily a matter for the Departments of Health and Children or Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but the reality is that this matter is the responsibility of this House. If a case like the one I have highlighted can happen, it is a tragedy. If dozens or even hundreds of cases like it can happen, it is a disaster and it is something in which Members on all sides of this House should be involved.</P>
    <P>The family support agency will be an important agency in the State. Many positive things have been done by this Minister, Deputy Ahern, and other members of Cabinet. I have drawn the particular cases in question to the attention of other members of Cabinet. It is interesting that a Minister of State said not long ago that when the details of one of these cases was presented to the House, it was the worst case he had ever heard of. The chief executive officer of one of the health boards involved told me that this case was a terrible tragedy. Somebody has to take hold of the crisis that exists. It is not something that can be simply passed from Billy to Jack because vulnerable families are under threat from the State.</P>
    <P>The State institutions are extraordinarily well funded. In the case of the family I mentioned in south County Dublin, the family business has gone down the tubes. They were out the door with legal debt. They were in a position where everything they had previously was put on the line, and their family life was devastated. They still do not know, four and a half years later, the reason this happened in a caring, Christian and civilised society. They should know the answer to that question. I offer the balance of the time remaining to me to Deputy Dennehy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is important legislation, particularly in the context of the attempt to prevent some of the social problems we see emerging almost on a daily basis. The emphasis should be on prevention. There are few more important issues to be dealt with than providing the support and encouragement badly needed for families and family relationships. Regardless of one's definition of a family unit, we are all aware of the problems that arise and if they are not dealt with and support given, it will be difficult to deal with the consequences. There are many lessons to be learned and we are learning them very slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise the changes that have taken place in society and the difficulties being faced by many citizens including, in particular, children. One way to offset those problems is by supporting the family unit and giving as much assistance as possible. Family support centres and community resource centres are of critical importance and should be central to the service which is provided, whether it is family mediation, counselling service or the encouragement of personal participation in individual training programmes. They have all proven themselves the best vehicle for <Col N="1466" /> the provision of such services and they must be given adequate funding and resources. I compliment the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his commitment in providing that support. These centres are closest to people who may have problems. They are run by local people, in most cases, and there is an awareness of just how difficult things can be in the real world. One of the primary reasons for their success is that they are based on local participation. Outside agencies may be involved from time to time but, if the unit is functioning correctly, it is locals who make all the important decisions.</P>
    <P>Based in my parish of Togher, in Cork, there is an excellent pre-school and family support unit, on which I have served as a trustee since its establishment about 20 years ago. My role &ndash; a purely honorary one &ndash; has allowed me to see, at very close quarters, what can be achieved by people working together, if enough support is provided. I appreciate the work of those involved in the Togher centre, particularly women, who are empowered to help themselves. Every aspect of daily living is dealt with, including budgeting, health issues, cultural and sporting activities, including large-scale participation in the Cork Evening Echo mini-marathon. Courses are available in many activities, such as computer literacy.</P>
    <P>It took quite a long time to convince the Southern Health Board that money spent on such family centres would be returned ten-fold in savings, over time. Prevention is far better than cure and far less costly in the long run. In addition to his support for local centres, the Minister has also provided the support services and co-ordination of effort required within his Department &ndash; a key aspect which was lacking in the past. I welcome the acknowledgement of that by previous speakers, especially Deputy Frances Fitzgerald in her positive comments. It is all too easy, for the sake of criticism or opposition, to distort the facts and ignore the advances which have been made. The Government's approach to family support is an important part of the help which must be provided to society. Government investment in the related programmes has escalated in the past four years from £1.5 million to more than £11 million per annum. That money has been used to set up and implement the various services and programmes that will, I hope, lead to a reduction in marriage break-ups and will help society generally.</P>
    <P>Family support is needed across the whole spectrum of society and a wide variety of needs. It is of little use telling people how to rear their children, or urging them to participate in social activities, if they cannot financially afford that participation. This Minister has been to the forefront in ensuring that financial support is available in the widest possible range of areas and in targeting the extra funds available. It is critically important to direct the funding to where it is most needed and where it will be appreciated and properly used.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> Child benefit is one vital aspect of family support. In the past, some politicians, on all sides, tended to preach to parents about their responsibilities but Government support was not always up to speed with such lectures. In 1996, child benefit was increased by £2 for the first, second and third child in a family but, in 1997, it was £1 for the first and second child and £5 for the third child. I suggest that people who would grant that kind of increase were not entitled to lecture anybody. The subsequent changes are worth noting. In 1998 and 1999, this Government did not break any records but, in 2000, we entered a new era of support for families, particularly larger families, when the Minister introduced increases of £25 for the first and second child and £30 for the third child. That is the type of action required, rather than mere lectures.</P>
    <P>The Family Support Agency will become an integral part of the Government's better approach to families and will help to co-ordinate the work of several existing programmes. I particularly commend the results which I have seen from the Togher centre as a basis for replication in other areas. I suggest to the Minister and his Department officials that flexibility is a vital ingredient in any programme, especially with people who are not used to dealing with State agencies. We need to be there to meet them and to appreciate their problems, rather than quoting chapter and verse to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle of this Bill. There is a keenly felt need, within communities, for a range of family mediation and counselling services. An agency to co-ordinate and provide resources for these services is progress and demonstrates a positive commitment, which I welcome. The individual citizen, the family and the community are the basic building blocks of our society. The rights of each must be vindicated and the needs of each must be recognised and provided for if we are to achieve a society which works cohesively, a caring society which cherishes all its citizens equally in all their diversity.</P>
      <P>Ours is a changed, and changing, society. The general understanding of what constitutes a family has changed &ndash; and rightly so. Those families who fell outside the standard definition of family were for too long excluded and discriminated against. Neither this Bill nor the 1937 Constitution defines the family, but Article 41.2 of the Constitution refers to &ldquo;woman's life within the home&rdquo;. That piece of sexism dates from the era when married women were prevented from working in the Civil Service. Article 41.3 pledges to &ldquo;guard with special care&rdquo; the institution of marriage, on which, it says, the family is founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most families are founded on marriage, but by no means are all so founded. For example, many families in our society consist of a single parent and a child or children. There are also many instances &ndash; and this is not a modern phenom<Col N="1468" /> enon &ndash; of grandparents rearing grandchildren. This has been known in our society for many generations. It is a pity this Bill does not contain an explicit recognition of what is now, thankfully, generally recognised in Ireland, that the traditionally defined nuclear family is not the only family form and not the only context in which children can find a safe and loving home. In my remarks, I want to reflect the concerns of the Family Resource Centre Forum about this legislation. That body has provided a simple and useful definition of family. It defines a family as comprising two or more people living in a co-dependent relationship and views all families as equally entitled to support. I concur with that.</P>
    <P>I recognise also that the majority of families, those based on long-term relationships, centred on marriage and the rearing of children need support, most especially when difficulties arise. I am concerned and disappointed at the lack of adequate consultation in the framing of this legislation. The Family Resource Centre Forum represents a network of community based centres, yet its inclusion in the remit of the Family Support Agency as set out in this legislation was presented as a <i>fait accompli</i> and in the words of the forum: &ldquo;no consultation occurred with any of the key stake holders&rdquo;. This is unacceptable. These experienced and committed people could have provided a very useful input into the law making process, but were effectively sidelined. However, they are expected to fulfil important functions under the aegis of the new agency.</P>
    <P>The Family Resource Centre Forum has welcomed any Government action which assists, supports or develops services of family mediation and counselling. It interprets its inclusion by Government in the Family Support Agency as an acknowledgement of the importance of its work in communities.</P>
    <P>The forum has three principal concerns with the Bill and the role expected of it. Those concerns are: the lack of consultation with the family resource centres preceding this legislation; the fact that the family resource centres operate on the guiding principle of community development; and the understanding inherent in this legislation of what constitutes a family.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper, Supporting Voluntary Activity, states that voluntary organisations have a right to be consulted about policy in the design and delivery of services and programmes. It seems this principle was not adhered to in the framing of this legislation. As a result we need to carry out another legislative fire brigade action. I have confidence the Minister will accept the validity of this argument and I hope he will assist in this effort by taking on board the real concerns being expressed and amend the Bill accordingly.</P>
    <P>The family resource centres suggest a number of key changes to the Bill. They seek recognition for the unique and cohesive ethos of the centres to ensure their continuation. The FRC Forum should be recognised as the consultative body for <Col N="1469" /> the centres. Community development principles should continue to be the basis of their operations. Very importantly the FRC Forum seeks the right to elect three members on to the board of the Family Support Agency. This is a key requirement and I urge the Minister to adopt it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There should be a genuine process of consultation from now on. Existing family resource centres should also be allowed to participate in the work of the agency or in the work of the community development programme under the community development support project programme. The Minister and I both represent constituencies in the north east region where there are four centres affected. They are the centre in Mullaghmatt and Cortolvin in Monaghan town, the centre at Tullacmongan in Cavan and further centres at Trim and Kells.</P>
    <P>Under the Family Support Agency, centres may be required to change their ethos from one based firmly on community development and the fight against poverty to one primarily focused on counselling and mediation in family difficulties. One of the primary causes of family difficulties and the break-up of families is poverty, housing poverty, educational poverty and lack of resources at many levels.</P>
    <P>Profound social changes in recent decades have seen the breakdown of the traditional support network provided by the extended family and the wider local community. For those with lower income, the impact of these changes has been far greater than for those cushioned by average or higher incomes. I hope the Minister can reassure us on the concerns that I and others have raised. I hope that, albeit belatedly, a process has already begun that will see all involved in supporting families and communities working together with a common purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Brendan Smith and Michael Ahern.</P>
      <P>In recent years the Oireachtas has spent considerable time establishing statutory agencies to deal with specific areas of policy and administration, which were previously under the aegis of a Department. I do not welcome this trend. The new organisations tend to be less open, transparent, accountable and democratic. Examples are: the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement, involving the transfer of responsibility from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Dublin Transportation Office; and the Environmental Protection Agency, involving the transfer of responsibility from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. If we ever return to an era of public expenditure cuts, will this plethora of new agencies survive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, I will suspend my concerns in the case of this Bill, given the importance of the family in our society. I welcome the name change given to the Minister's Department. It was once the Department of Social Welfare and in 1997 it <Col N="1470" /> became the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Minister has developed this initiative and put families at the centre of Government policies. I note also the commitment of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair and his Government to do this. This is not before time.</P>
    <P>In a Fianna Fáil policy document published in July 1995, the sixth in a list of the party's aims and objectives states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes in a caring, socially responsive society, which is pro-family, cares for the weak and socially excluded and stresses the responsibility of each citizen as a member of that society. The family is the core building block of society. Its gradual disintegration in modern society leads to the aggravation of social problems, particularly the breakdown of law and order and heavy demands on the health and social services. Fianna Fáil is committed to supporting the cohesion of the basic family unit in all its policies, while responding humanely and effectively to situations caused by breakdown, stresses or human rights abuses inside families.</P>
    <P>The family is the basic unit of society. If people are to accept this they must first believe in the concept of society but not everyone does. For example, Margaret Thatcher did not. She believed instead in the individual as part of an economy, but we will leave that argument for another day.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented economic growth of recent years has been good and bad for families. It has been good in that parents have more material wealth to provide for families. I cannot over emphasise the importance of this. Poverty hurts families. However, it has been bad in that the increases in house prices has placed growing pressures on both parents to work to pay the mortgage. Other problems include the lack of affordable child care, traffic and transportation problems, increased expectations, crime, drug abuse and marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The new agency to be established under this legislation will have much work to do, including in the area of parenting skills. Most parents get no training in this area. Previously we relied on the extended family network, which is now in decline. Hitherto, parents had to learn as they went along and most succeeded. However, some need help and this agency will fill that role.</P>
    <P>I praise the Minister for Finance for increasing child benefits in his budgets. They benefit parents who work in and outside the home, which is as it should be. I also praise the Minister's commitment to grants schemes. There are grants for voluntary organisations, community development, education and training, locally based community and family support groups, the family and community services resource centre programme and the community development programme. There are also financial advice and budgeting services. These go a long way to support families, communities and voluntary organisations. Like pre<Col N="1471" /> vious speakers I commend the role of voluntary organisations and am pleased to see them acknowledged and appreciated by the Department. They should be even more celebrated in this, the international year of the volunteer.</P>
    <P>The family mediation service, a relatively new concept, does invaluable work. Not everybody is aware of what it does and in view of this it should be widely publicised and promoted. The previous speaker referred to the traditional definition of a family encompassing a husband, wife and children. I accept that the realities of modern life means that this definition no longer holds good. In this regard the Parents Alone resource centre in my constituency was founded to reflect changes in the family. It has done incredible work on research and support for lone parents. The Minister accepts that such groups do important work and they should be encouraged and supported.</P>
    <P>The individualisation of the standard rate tax band, introduced in Budget 2000, appears to discriminate against single income households. In view of the forecast downturn in the economy will this issue be revisited to take account of the prevailing economic circumstances and the interests of society as a whole?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister's commitment to support families and I commend his work on implementing the recommendations of the Commission on the Family. An Action Programme for the Millennium, put before the people at the last general election by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, emphasised the importance of putting families first. The Minister has strongly supported the policies in the programme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the family support agency will provide a family mediation service and that it will support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationships counselling services and family support services. It is important that the efforts of many groups who are doing valuable work on a voluntary basis are co-ordinated and supported in a practical way. Last year, I introduced representatives of the Cavan family resources centre to meet the Minister and officials in his Department. I compliment the centre on its work in marriage and bereavement counselling and across a range of other areas. I hope the Minister will give the centre official recognition and the financial support it needs to have full-time staff properly rewarded and resourced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supportive role the Minister has given to community development is self evident. The <Col N="1472" /> number of family and community resource centres has increased from ten in 1997 to 80 today while the number of community development projects has increased from 90 to 130. The number of core funded groups doubled from 130 in 1997 to 260 to date. Funding for this area in the Minister's Department has tripled, from £6 million in 1997 to in excess of £17 million this year. This is clear evidence of the Minister's and Government's commitment to the development of community work and to support for worthwhile community development projects.</P>
    <P>I was involved at the outset with the development of a resource centre at Tullymongan in County Cavan. The committee members and people in the wider community very much appreciate the support provided by the Minister in the form of grant assistance to projects and by his visits to the centre on a number of occasions to compliment those involved on their work and to see at first hand the range of facilities provided and activities undertaken. It is worth noting the range of activities in what is a relatively small centre that caters for a number of housing estates in Cavan town. It has a homework club, two youth clubs, a youth group scheme operated by the North Eastern Health Board and members of the community, pre-school five mornings per week and a &lsquo;tweenies' group. There is band practice twice a week, the church choir uses it twice weekly for practice, there is mass each Sunday morning, there is computer training morning and evening, Monday to Friday, a women's group meets twice a week, the North Eastern Health Board has an office there and the local sporting clubs use the facilities to raise funds through discos, dances and other activities. Rooms are rented to other groups for meetings, information nights, etc. At present the committee is in the process of establishing a lone parents group and providing a range of activities for Travellers. This range of activities is a great credit to those who established the centre, first under the chairmanship of Councillor Patricia Walsh and a small group of other committed people. The Minister's assistance and that of the local authority made it possible for the centre to provide these very worthwhile facilities.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill, I have difficulty with the proposal to bring the community development projects under the remit of the agency. A family support agency should be primarily involved in counselling and family mediation. The resource centres, such as the one at Tullymongan, engage in different activities. I hope it will be possible to retain funding for the management of those centres directly from the Department. The range of activities is broad and is not in the area of family mediation or counselling. I also have a difficulty with the number of regional support agencies and specialised support agencies which are operating to support various community development projects. I do not see the need to have so many. They must be duplicating the work of officials in the Department and I would like to <Col N="1473" /> know what percentage of the overall funding for community development projects is being used up through their work. I would like the funding to go directly to the centres where the range of activities that is so important to so many communities is being carried out voluntarily. There are community development workers attached to some of these resource centres and that is very welcome. If funding is to be given &ndash; apart from funding for bricks and mortar &ndash; let it go directly to the personnel working in the centres, not to groups monitoring the work on a regional or national basis. Funding given directly to the centres will yield a better return and ensure that the goals envisaged by the Minister will be achieved. That will allow useful work to be done within the communities in need of support and development.</P>
    <P>Many people of all ages have benefited enormously from the programmes organised at the resource centre in Cavan, to which I referred. It helps to develop a community spirit. Many people have become computer literate and have gained IT expertise through the availability of courses in the centres in their communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for the excellent work he has done in the area of family and child development over the past four years. As has been said by previous Deputies, when we were the Opposition we recognised the need for vast investment in support of the family. We also realised that the definition of what constitutes the family had widened. I would not call the previous definition narrow because the family should be based on marriage, but our society has changed and we have to look at lone parents and co-habiting couples as families.</P>
      <P>Life has changed. Years ago there was support from the extended family for young parents. Grandparents lived in the home or nearby and were not put into hospitals and nursing homes as happens increasingly nowadays. They were there to help the younger members of the family growing up and to lend support when there was trouble. The problem of lone parents did not exist to the same extent as it does today and there was not the increase in marriage break down that has been occurring in recent years. We recognised the need to establish a system to support those in need.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, funding for family counselling services has increased five fold, from £900,000 in 1997 to £4.8 million today. The family mediation service has been expanded from two centres at Dublin and Limerick in 1997 to 11 today. The number of people availing of family mediation has increased from 250 in 1997 to more than 1,200 last year while investment in the service has quadrupled from £300,000 to £1.35 million. The number of family and community centres has increased from ten in 1997 to 70. We recognise the need and we are providing the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> I support what Deputy Brendan Smith said about family resource centres. A number of them in my own constituency have done tremendous work for the whole area. They are fearful of being brought under the umbrella of the family support agency. One of the reasons for their fear is the manner in which the current support agencies are treating the family resource centres. They are afraid the family support agency will further dilute the ethos of the family resource centres and control what happens at local level. There is a definite need for supervision of resource centres, but there is a question to be asked. Are there too many intermediary bodies standing between the Department and the family support agencies? I ask the Minister to look at that in the period before the enactment of the Bill. Local people are involved at local resource centres and they have a great knowledge of what is happening in the area. Most of them are well qualified, especially those who are leaving the resource centres. They do not need too much supervision from intermediary bodies which can tend to be in the business of building their own little empires.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister in bringing forward a very necessary service, but I ask him to ensure that this legislation does not have a detrimental effect on the family resource centres. They are doing tremendous work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with everyone else in welcoming this Bill. The timing in bringing it before the House is very important. Despite the fact that we hear the Celtic tiger roaring and we live in a time of great economic prosperity when there are huge reserves of money available, the family is under more pressure than ever before. Families find it more and more difficult to live normal lives and the everyday problems they encounter in health, education and housing are leading to that greater pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are financial pressures on the family. Nowadays two people have to go out to work in order to pay for mortgages and the daily out goings of many ordinary families and that brings huge strain as life moves into a faster lane. We come across many hardship cases. I have come across some which have amazed me. Families experience financial hardship and difficulties and the pressures they impose. The banking institutions should note what I am saying. I have encountered one case where a family has encountered financial problems and cannot pay back its mortgage. The bank is not putting them out on the road as it did in the past. It is taking back the house and leasing it to the family. That is not a good move. That is a retrograde step in an era where we are trying to support the family. The <Col N="1475" /> home is the cornerstone of any family. I do not know if the Minister is aware of this problem but it must be addressed by the Government. Institutions that are involved in this kind of activity must change their attitude if proper support is to be afforded to families.</P>
    <P>People in local authority houses encounter financial difficulties as a result of rent and arrears that they are unable to pay. Many of these people receive some form of income from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. I know of a family that owes over £3,000 in arrears that is being threatened with eviction. While some support does exist, there is no effort to help those people out. There are young people and small children who may be put out of their house in the next few weeks. We must intervene in such cases. A Bill such as the one we are discussing should have a clause built in to help such people.</P>
    <P>The issues of health and higher education grants need to be addressed. With regard to higher education grants, there are huge problems. The income threshold in not high enough and needs to be raised.</P>
    <P>The Minister should listen to the plea of backbenchers concerning family resource centres. He was in my constituency, which he knows extremely well, and is aware of the impact the centres are having on the community, in places such as Knockanrawley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be delighted to hear that. I welcome the discussion on the family. It is one of the more serious issues we have to deal with in our offices and clinics every week. When I entered the Dáil almost nine years ago, potholes and farm grants were the issues of importance in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. Now, problems pertaining to families are to the fore. There should be another family resource centre in Cavan not just in Tullymongan. I appreciate the work of the one about which Deputy Smith spoke. However, based on the letters I have received from that centre, the staff do not have the same regard for the Minister. They are very annoyed that there has not been proper consultation and they are worried about the future of the centre.</P>
      <P>Time does not permit me to deal with their problems and those of the Drumlin Community Group in Carrickmacross, etc., but they are real problems. Will the Minister take these issues into account on Committee Stage so these groups can be given assurance and security? They have done a tremendous job. I agree with everything that Deputy Smith said about the work they did and are continuing to do. The same can be said of the centres in Monaghan. However, they must be given security and must be recognised. The Minister has visited them and his Department has been very supportive of them. He should not run away from them now and should make sure they are properly controlled and accorded the status they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> The real problems today are housing, the cost of rented accommodation and the cost of child care. The cost of rented accommodation has trebled in the past four years. Those on social welfare only will get the health board allowance, but others who are in some sort of small employment cannot get it. It is extremely hard to live when paying £100 per week for a flat in a town such as Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The problems concerning the family are serious. It is an important institution. The figures are frightening. The birth rate outside marriage in 1960 was 1.6%, it is now 31%. Thirteen percent of families are headed by lone parents. There is an enormous amount of poverty in society, whether we want to recognise it or not. Much is being done at national level for different kinds of people, but lone parents, who are such because of widowhood or otherwise, need to be looked after and require our full support.</P>

      <P>The support agency brings together into a new body the main programmes and pro-family services introduced by the Government in recent years. The legislative proposal aims to provide a comprehensive and coherent approach to the future development and delivery of essential supports for families, to promote continuity and stability in family life and to foster a supportive community for families at local level. These are the key components of the Government's family-first approach.</P>
      <P>As the discussions in the House have shown, the objectives of the Bill are shared by all of us as policy makers, legislators and members of families and local communities. I thank the Deputies for their generous support of what the Bill proposes to achieve.</P>
      <P>A number of issues were raised in the debate, some of which I would like to address. Some Deputies sought clarification on how the new agency would bring together the different strands that are involved. They wanted to know what kind of structure would be put in place in the composition of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new agency will have three core responsibilities: first, the provision of a family mediation service; second, to support the development of marriage and relationship counselling services provided by voluntary organisations throughout the country; and third, to support the local family and community resource centre programme. Its responsibility is also to undertake research, and the Bill will strengthen its remit and its approach to the provision of information to the public and will underpin its role in advising me, as Minister <Col N="1477" /> for Social, Community and Family Affairs. These responsibilities will be carried out in consultation with the key stakeholders, such as the voluntary organisations providing counselling services and marriage resource centres.</P>
    <P>A board will oversee the agency. It will have a chief executive, whose job it will be to develop and foster the three distinct areas of the business. Coherence across these activities will be ensured by the board, whose members will include people who have expertise and experience in the fields relating to the agency's responsibility. Staff interests will be represented on the board. In all, there will be 12 members of the agency, including a chairperson. I consider this to be a reasonable size for an agency charged with the responsibilities listed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the agency will work with other public bodies with shared interest in family matters and will carry out its responsibilities having regard to the Government's social inclusion priorities. This is designed to bring about much greater coherence in terms of what we are trying to achieve for families, especially those that are most vulnerable. The agency will provide the comprehensive response that families of today need and will be a catalyst for a new relationship between the State, community and family in addressing the complex social problems that arise today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald asked how the family support agency would ensure the future survival of the family mediation service and how its ethos and identity could be safeguarded. Ten years ago, family mediation as a professional service, with its potential as a non-adversarial approach for couples in resolving issues concerning marital separation, was virtually unknown in this country. In 1985, a small pilot service was introduced in Dublin and for some years it struggled to maintain its existence in the face of limited resources and the scarcity of qualified staff to run it.</P>
    <P>It is important to say, as did one or two speakers, that not everybody knows of the existence of the mediation service. That is something I have said to the mediation service in my discussions over the past four years. I have also given it money to advertise its service. I have heard their advertisement on the local radio stations, Northern Sound, and LMFM. I compliment them on portraying the service as being available. It is also the case that, when I came to office, this service had just two centres, one in Limerick and the other in Dublin. It now has 11 and will have 12 early in the new year when another one will be opened in Blanchardstown. Members raised the issue of a centre in the north-west. That is a problem. It is not a problem of financial resources but the fact that we cannot find a qualified mediator in the area. I challenge the representatives of the area to highlight the need for a mediator in the area. I would like Deputy Crawford to know that it should not be a party hack.</P>
    <Col N="1478" />
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not know anything about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Radically improved Government investment in recent years and the commitment of dedicated professional staff have ended the marginalistion of the family mediation service. It is recognised as being at the leading edge in the development of professional standards in the field. The Bill ensures a secure future for the service and that must be understood. In the review of the programme for Government at the half-way stage of the lifetime of the Government, we promised to place the mediation service on a statutory footing. That will be done when we pass the Bill. The legislation guarantees the future support and development of the mediation service and provides the basis for the development of a viable profession of highly qualified family mediators throughout the country. It is important to note that we are one of only a few countries in the developed world which have taken a legislative initiative in this important area of family support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald also referred to the need to protect the ethos of the service. Family support is one of the most value-laden areas of public policy, as Members will know, and understandably so because we are dealing with matters which are highly personal. People rightly have high expectations in this area because of the way in which the support of the Government for family life is fundamentally important to our aspirations and ideals about family life and the type of society to which we aspire. Trust, confidentiality, security and neutrality are hugely important to people in dealing with sensitive aspects of family life. These values are intrinsic to the professional ethos of the family mediation service and to the family counselling and support services.</P>
      <P>Family resource centres engage with their local communities in an empowering way unique to them which fosters self-reliance and participation. The family support agency as a separate, independent body dedicated to the preservation of family relationships is better placed than the Department to safeguard these values in meeting the needs of families, dealing with sensitive family situations and supporting and promoting a community environment in which people's deeply held beliefs about family life and the type of society to which they aspire can be affirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand some of the views expressed by Members about the establishment of yet another agency. However, having discussed this at length with my departmental officials, I believed we had reached the stage where we had invested huge resources in the past four years in the family mediation service. I do not say that in a party political way. We had either quadrupled or multiplied by five the amount of financial resources, not to mention the manpower times invested in this issue. We believed that developing the service into an agency which could call on the expertise of people who had know<Col N="1479" /> ledge in this area was the right way to go. I accept what Members said about another agency, but I assure them that, if they examine the legislation closely, they will see that, in all instances, the agency, unlike others which have been established, is answerable to me, as Minister, and to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>Will the Department still retain the family unit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Deputy Perry asked when a family mediation service would be provided in Sligo. I have already referred to that when speaking about the north-west. It is regretted by the Department that, despite considerable advertising and promotion, it has not been possible to recruit a suitable, qualified mediator to work in that region. It is a gap and we wish to fill it. The financial resources are available for it.</P>
      <P>The Bill complements the vision of the National Children's Strategy set out for our children. The strategy acknowledges the importance of children in their own right. It recognises that they must be supported in the context of the family. The Bill comprehensively addresses these family needs.</P>
      <P>Several Members referred to proposals in the Bill concerning family resource centres. These are an essential component of the Government's family first approach in building neighbourhood solidarity and responding to families locally. That is why they have been singled out by the Government for radical improvement and expansion in recent years, a course recommended by the Commission on the Family. It is important to say again that, when I came to office, there were ten family resource centres. The Government in its programme for Government promised to increase the number of family resource centres to 100. As Members have said, in the region of 80 are either up and running or are about to be. I would not do anything to reduce the importance of the family resource centres, but the logic of including them under the new agency in the Bill is that it would be a nonsense if they were excluded when it will be an important resource for their work.</P>
      <P>Reassurance on all these matters, clarification of the Government's policies as regards the new agency, the promotion and development of the centres' ways of working as well as the administrative and practical issues to be addressed in ensuring a smooth transfer of programmes to the new agency are all the subject of ongoing discussions between my officials in the Department and representatives of the family resource centre forum. I will address the family resource centre programme later.</P>
      <P>The regional support agencies have worked well in the development of family resource</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> centres. They would not be working with them if there were only ten in the country. There are now 80 as a result of the work we have done in the past four years. I see the agencies as having a continuing role but accept some of the criticism Members have made in this regard. It is something of which we are conscious. When the elected representatives of the people make these points, we must take them on board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche referred to the issue of the difficult interaction between the State child care services and families. It is something of which people are aware. The family mediation service is exploring the potential for family mediation in the context of child protection disputes. It has qualified personnel in this regard who will examine this issue. The agency intends holding information sessions in January for key personnel in the area of child protection matters. It is something in which it would have a role to play.</P>
    <P>Some Members referred to the front cover of the research report, Grandparenthood in Modern Ireland, which was compiled independently of us but with finance from our research programme. Members will know this was an excellent report. I specifically asked when we designed the research programme that the issue of grandparenthood be examined because I was aware, not only from my experience as a public representative but also as a qualified solicitor, that grandparents can unfortunately be excluded from the general family unit in separation situations. This research programme was brought forward and this excellent report was produced.</P>
    <P>Some Members had a problem with the cover and suggested that, in some way, I had something to do with it. I did not. The picture on the cover is of Lucy Freud, the mother of the painter Lucian Freud and a grandmother. Lucian Freud generously agreed to allow Age Action Ireland, which sponsored the report, to use the painting of his mother free of charge as a gesture of support for its work with older people. I know a number of Members may have in a tongue-in-cheek way raised the issue of the cover but I have put the facts on record.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their comments. I look forward to Committee Stage and the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>During the summer recess of the Dáil, I undertook an official visit to Brazil from 18 to 22 July, and to Argentina from 22 to 24 July.</P>
      <P>My visit to Brazil, the first official visit by a Taoiseach, afforded an opportunity to extend Ireland's bilateral political and economic relations with that country. In addition to visiting the capital, Brasilia, I also travelled to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro for meetings with political leaders and members of the economic community.</P>
      <P>I had a substantive meeting with President Cardoso in Brasilia on 18 July, where the President briefed me on the recent recovery of the Brazilian economy. The President also outlined a number of policy initiatives that have been taken to address the income and wealth disparities in Brazilian society. He indicated in this context that it would take a number of years of concerted and continued effort to significantly narrow this income gap. We discussed opportunities for increased trade between our countries, particularly in the telecommunications, high tech and agricultural sectors. I informed the President of the Government's decision to open a resident Embassy in Brasilia, and a Consulate in Sao Paulo.</P>
      <P>In Sao Paulo on 19 July, I met the State Governor, Mr. Geraldo Alkmin and the Mayor, Ms Marta Suplicy, and gave an address to the Federation of Industries of the State of Sao Paulo. I paid a courtesy call to the University of Sao Paulo and met staff from the Irish Studies Department. I also attended a reception for the Irish community and met representatives of the Irish Missionaries working in Brazil on the evening of 18 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday, 20 July I addressed the Federation <Col N="1484" /> of Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro on Ireland's recent economic growth and I met the State Governor, Mr. Antonio Garotinho. I gave an address at a luncheon co-hosted by Enterprise Ireland and the Brazilian Centre for Industrial Relations, and attended a reception for the Irish community. I also visited an Irish run social project just outside Rio de Janeiro on Saturday, 21 July.</P>
    <P>In the course of my visit to Argentina from 22-24 July, I met President de la Rúa. During this meeting I had the opportunity to discuss the business opportunities that exist between our two economies and ways in which trade could be expanded. I also met the Foreign Minister, Rodriguez Giavarini, members of the Argentine Senate and Chamber of Deputies, and the Governor of the State of Buenos Aires, Dr. Aníbal Ibarra. I addressed the Argentine National Council for International Relations and a gathering of senior Argentine business executives at a luncheon hosted by the Chairman of the National Bank, Dr. Enrique Oliviera. I also attended a reception for the Irish community in Argentina.</P>
    <P>On 3 September I met Premier Zhu Rongji during his official visit to Ireland. We had a very useful and constructive meeting with a wide ranging agenda covering bilateral, regional and global issues. The meeting continued the exchanges between us during my visit to China in 1998 and at ASEM III last year in Seoul.</P>
    <P>We noted the rapid growth of our economic and trade relations and the very high level of bilateral co-operation both in the economic and education areas. We identified areas for further co-operation and development including IT and software, cultural and educational exchanges, building infrastructure and the transfer of managerial expertise. We noted that the ASEM process had proved to be productive and successful and looked forward to a successful ASEM IV summit in Copenhagen next year. The Premier's programme also included the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Cultural Relations between our two countries.</P>
    <P>The Premier and I discussed human rights both in our private meeting and in the plenary meeting of the delegations. We discussed Ireland's concerns in this area including, in particular, our concerns regarding Tibet and Falun Gong.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity to raise the case of the Trinity College student, Zhao Ming, who is currently detained in China. The Premier agreed to convey the interest of the Irish Government and people on the case of Zhao Ming to the Chinese judicial authorities.</P>
    <P>While a full meeting of minds could not be expected in our discussions, I very much welcome the Premier's openness to change and dialogue on human rights with friendly countries. He said he was in favour of further dialogue on this issue. The Premier was keenly aware of the degree of public interest in Ireland in human rights in China, and the importance we attach to the <Col N="1485" /> ongoing dialogue between China and the EU on human rights.</P>
    <P>This important high-level visit afforded a valuable opportunity to review the rapidly expanding relationship between Ireland and China and plan for its future development. We are currently reviewing the &ldquo;Asia Strategy&rdquo; adopted by the Government in an effort to increase and focus the attention of the Irish business community on the Asia-Pacific region in general, and on the huge potential of the Chinese market in particular. We are also seeking to broaden the base of our relationship by enhancing the level of cultural exchanges and by increasing educational co-operation.</P>
    <P>On 24 September, I welcomed President Valdas Adamkus of Lithuania on his first official visit to Ireland. The President was accompanied by a trade delegation. In the course of our discussions, we noted that while our bilateral trade is modest it is expanding rapidly and we welcomed this positive trend. I expressed the belief that this visit would raise public awareness in Ireland of Lithuania, and in this context we welcomed the Memorandum of Understanding on Cultural Exchanges between our two countries which was signed the following day. The President informed me of his particular desire to promote student exchanges with Ireland. I congratulated Lithuania on the progress of their European Accession negotiations.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the President and I discussed the outcome of the Nice Referendum last June. I emphasised that Ireland remained strongly committed to the European Union and to the enlargement process. The President said that Lithuania was working very hard to fulfil its accession requirements and hoped to be among the first wave of applicant countries to join the EU in 2004.</P>
    <P>On Monday, 15 October, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I met Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian Authority. We discussed the world situation and, in particular, the situation in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I affirmed our belief that the achievement of a negotiated just settlement of the Palestinian question was a vital step in the struggle for international peace and security. I acknowledged the efforts of President Arafat in seeking to create a climate of stability which would permit the re-engagement of discussions with Israel. I confirmed that Ireland would give any help within our capacity towards supporting the peace process and the attainment of a just settlement of the Palestinian issue. Ireland's special responsibility at this time as Chair of the UN Security Council was of particular importance to President Arafat.</P>
    <P>President Arafat and I had detailed discussions on security in the Middle East. The President stressed he is making every effort to advance the peace process in order to consolidate the previous agreements made. President Arafat expressed his appreciation for the work of the European Union and Javier Solana. He was grateful for the <Col N="1486" /> achievements of EU observers to date and requested the presence of further observers.</P>
    <P>I emphasised the urgent need for resumed negotiations between the parties and that these talks should not be limited to security issues. In particular I stressed that such talks must include a substantial political dimension which should move forward to full implementation of the Mitchell proposals as an integral whole and without preconditions. A settlement must be reached which recognises the rights of the Palestinian people to a viable state of their own, living in peace and security with Israel.</P>
    <P>President Arafat assured me that he will continue to the extent of his ability to try to achieve stability in the region. Failure to make progress undermines that stability. Ireland and our EU partners have made it clear to Israel that we expect a positive response to these efforts.</P>
    <P>I expect to visit the United States in early November. My programme for this visit has not yet been finalised. However, I expect to visit Boston, New York and Washington.</P>
    <P>I have laid copies of my speeches in Argentina and Brazil before the Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will supply the information as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine, Taoiseach. I have no disagreement with the Taoiseach; it is the Ceann Comhairle with whom I am having a slight disagreement at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stated aim of the Taoiseach's trip to Brazil and Argentina was to improve trade between those two countries and Ireland. What improve<Col N="1487" /> ments have taken place in trade between Ireland and Argentina or Brazil since the Taoiseach's visit or what prospective improvements are envisaged?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are enormous opportunities for trade, particularly with Brazil. Argentina is undergoing a difficult period and while there are some clear opportunities there, the process will be slower. The situation in Brazil is progressing well. We made arrangements during my visit for a senior delegation of Brazilian business people to visit Ireland. I understand that visit is to take place in mid-November. The Brazilians are anxious to do business. A number of Irish companies have already started operations in Brazil and, on foot of my visit, further discussions on this matter took place. The Kerry Group commenced operations there approximately two years ago and this had led to a number of further opportunities. Even though there have been difficulties in the software and hardware sectors of the high-tech industry, a number of opportunities have also arisen.</P>
      <P>The advantage of visits such as that in which I engaged is that links of communication are opened between Irish State agencies, Ministers and key officials here and those of the countries visited. Brazil is an enormous country and our figures for trade with it have improved dramatically in recent years. However, there is huge potential for growth. I addressed several business groups from the banking, financial and computing sectors and I believe we have a good opportunity of extending our operations into that market, admittedly from a very low base. There are real opportunities for Enterprise Ireland and the food sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, also visited Brazil two years ago to promote the food sector. I felt pleased that, after my visit, we had forged direct links which will allow our State agencies, business groups and some chambers of commerce to build on the progress that has been made. I accept that this will not happen overnight, but there is no doubt that a number of potential opportunities exist across a range of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask three questions, the first of which relates to embassies. The Taoiseach stated that it is the intention to open a residential embassy in Brasilia and a commercial attaché-consulate in São Paulo. In a separate reply to questions on an announcement made immediately after the defeat of the Nice referendum, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that embassies would be opened in the capitals of all the applicant member states including Vilnius in Lithuania. What is the exact position in relation to the opening of the embassies to which I refer and the consulate in São Paulo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question relates to the Taoiseach's meeting with the Chinese Prime Minister. Did the <Col N="1488" /> Taoiseach express concern about the fact that more than half the people who are executed throughout the world by capital punishment regimes are executed in China? In the period 1990 to 1999, more than 27,000 people were sentenced to death in the People's Republic of China and of these 18,000 were executed. For a country whose population is only one twentieth of the world's population, China is responsible for more than 50% of the global total of executions. On a <i>pro rata</i> basis, Texas is probably next in line behind China in this regard. Did the Taoiseach raise his concerns about those infringements of what is regarded as a fundamental human right in Europe?</P>
    <P>My final question relates to the current position of a Chinese student, Zhao Ming, who was a student at Trinity College and who has been imprisoned by the authorities in China because of his membership of Falun Gong?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated, during last year's Estimates process, that embassies would be opened in the capitals of the accession countries over a two year period. I had previously stated that we would open an embassy and a consulate in Brazil and the final arrangements are being made in this regard. If they are not up and running already, they will be by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I may not have raised the exact figures to which the Deputy refers with the Chinese Premier, but I did receive a very strong briefing on a range of human rights issues from the Department of Foreign Affairs and, both privately and publicly, we made our views clear on these. Premier Zhu Rongji, whom I have met on three occasions, does not deny that things are happening in his country of which its people are not proud. His position is that the Chinese are endeavouring to reform their society as quickly as possible and introduce modern human rights regulations. He has engaged in numerous meetings with the UN's representative, Mrs. Mary Robinson, on these issues and there is a view abroad that the Chinese are definitely trying to change. Mr. Zhu Rongji finds it peculiar that we have so much interest in issues of this nature and is surprised by the views we have in respect of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised with Premier Zhu Rongji the issue of Zhao Ming, having met the Trinity students in advance and obtained their side of the story. He did not, either privately or publicly, give much sympathy to the case I put forward about Falun Gong. The Deputy will have seen the press briefing where the Premier took the opportunity to give his views which, needless to say, were entirely opposite to those expressed to me by the students and contained in the brief I received from the Department of Foreign Affairs. He referred to Falun Gong as an evil cult at that press conference. However, he did give a commitment to pass on our views to the judicial authorities in China and he has done so. I have remained in contact with the group of Trinity <Col N="1489" /> students to which I refer in respect of this matter. These people are not acting on behalf of Falun Gong, they are merely concerned because of the treatment being received by a friend of theirs. It was made clear to me that while some of them may be involved with Falun Gong, others were acting only out of friendship. I have continued to follow the case and it has been confirmed to me that the Premier honoured his promise. However, we still await the response of the judicial authorities. My argument to the Premier was that participation in Falun Gong appears to be enough to lead to people being given fairly hefty remand sentences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that he has continued to follow the case since Zhu Rongji's visit. What is the current position? Has he replied to the Taoiseach, either through his ambassador or through the authorities in Beijing, indicating the follow-up in relation to the Zhao Ming case? Can the Taoiseach tell us the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have followed this through the ambassador. They informed us without any prompting that they had passed the case to the judicial authorities. I have been back on two occasions since and we have not received any information from the Chinese authorities on the views of the judicial authorities. I met the students recently again and I asked for an update. As I understand it, the students still held that there had been no change in the situation. It is a very long story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that it is completely disingenuous of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to pretend to him that he is not responsible for the civil rights abuses that exist and that some other agency, with which he is interceding, is responsible? Is it not clearly the case that the Government of China is responsible for what happens in China?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that since his intercession with the Chinese Prime Minister in the case of Zhao Ming, which I fully support, a week ago we had an example that not a modicum of humanity is being shown by the Chinese auth<Col N="1490" /> orities towards those in distress? Is the Taoiseach aware that the mother of a Chinese national here, Ms Dai Dongxue, whom the Taoiseach has possibly met with the Trinity students and who is one of the main advocates for Zhao Ming's release, died last Monday week and the Chinese Embassy here refused point blank to give her permission to travel home for the funeral? The Chinese authorities also refused to release her two sisters who are in a prison camp as a result of their Falun Gong sympathies. Will the Taoiseach redouble his representations? Does he agree that if our country and Government are to have ongoing trade and political relations with the Chinese Government, then the Chinese Government must move immediately on these issues, release Zhao Ming and stop the persecution of innocent people because of their beliefs? </P>
    <P>Mr. Zhu Rongji came here for specific reasons, not the good of his health. Whatever benefits trade with this country confer on China, it must be made clear to him that will not happen unless they change this horrific situation.</P>

      <P>The development of our trade and economic relationship with the Asian region is central to the Government's Asian strategy programme, which was launched some years ago. Regarding China specifically, our exports have more than doubled in the past three years. It is a very good business area.</P>
      <P>Having said that, there are ongoing difficulties with human rights. I raised the issue of the Falun Gong but they see it in an entirely different way. I will continue with this case involving Zhao Ming; I have given a commitment on this and I will continue to press it. However, as I said, they say that once someone is on remand it is with the judicial authorities and it is not a matter for the Government to influence. They pass on the case, so it is perhaps not so different from the situation in other countries.</P>
      <P>They take an extraordinarily hard line on the Falun Gong. What we are told about the Falun Gong and how they interpret it is entirely different. Mr. Rongji did not agree with anything I or anyone else said about the Falun Gong when he was here. He sees them as an evil cult and not religious. He was very strong on the issue. I did not get anywhere near persuading him otherwise; he was not even prepared to listen to the facts I had been given by Members, students and others. He sees the Falun Gong in an entirely different way and there is no use saying any different here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 I met the UN representative, Mary Robinson, in China on her first meeting with them and she has continued since then to make progress on this and other matters. China now accepts that its image abroad is tarnished by the kinds of figures mentioned by Deputy Quinn, by the way they treat human rights issues and that the way it deals with this leaves a lot to be desired. The Chinese Prime Minister argued publicly and privately that the situation is not as bad as the facts suggest, that they are bringing in <Col N="1491" /> enormous reforms, that they are working with the UN and that they are changing things. China claims there are old practices that are not easily changed but that it is moving forward. We must continue to make the point, as a friendly country, that we see enormous room for improvements. Nobody could stand over the statistics and particularly in the regions there seems to be no understanding of human rights. There appears to be an understanding of human rights in the more moderate cities, where they have one set of laws, but that does not extend out into the regions.</P>

I assures him that in the Forum for Europe and in the period ahead the Government will do all it can to see how we can address this issue so that by the end of next year we will be in a position to allow the enlargement process to go ahead and not be responsible for blocking it.

      <P>I listened with interest to the Taoiseach's comments on his visit to Brazil. He mentioned his involvement with food companies and that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, had been there two years earlier. Can the Taoiseach advise us on the type of production which is taking place in the food sector in Brazil? Must Brazilian producers comply with the same sort of controls as Irish producers? Certainly the Minister, Deputy Walsh, seems to have been very successful, judging by the fact that two years ago there were only 30 tonnes of chicken meat coming into this country while in the intervening two year period the imports increased from 30 tonnes to 300 tonnes at a time when the industry in Ireland was on its knees. It is extremely important that we know whether hormones, steroids or all these other things which we ban are being allowed to be used there. Only recently I found that steroids are being used in milk production in the US in a big way. We must compete with the US on world markets. It is important that the Taoiseach can assure us that our producers are working on equally competitive terms with those who are supplying meat to Ireland. I hope the Minister and the Taoiseach will rectify the balance of trade to make sure we can export as much as they can import to Ireland &ndash; 10% increase in two years is dramatic.</P>

Can we be sure that the same traceability criteria is being applied to the food we are importing? If that is not the case, there is clearly unfair competition affecting Irish and European chicken producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not put myself forward as an expert on the rules and regulations, but I understand, certainly from the Irish companies involved, that they have put enormous capital investment into meeting the standards. It is my understanding that these are WTO standards and they must abide by those standards. Their production cost base is perhaps not as expensive or extensive as it would be if they were located in the European Union, but the Kerry Group, which I mentioned, is not only involved in that but in a <Col N="1493" /> range of different food facilities. If I am correct about the chickens, Brazil is not the only country involved. There are a number of other countries in the region which are our biggest competitors and Thailand is one of the enormous exporters. While I do not claim to be an expert, I know the plants they have are extremely sophisticated and costly. They are involved in what is obviously mass production, but it is a very expensive operation. I would imagine that their staff costs base is not anything like that which would prevail in the European Union. I will raise the issue with the Minister, but I understand the regulations concerned are those of the WTO and therefore they would have to comply with the highest standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the WTO regulations, I visited a farm in the US last week. The way they are dealing with their products is totally different to our way, yet they are supposed to be dealing with them in the same way. They are using steroids to increase milk yields and their yields are 10%, 15% or 20% higher than ours. When we, through the EU, agree trade agreements with countries like the US, it is important that our producers are not being forced to meet a handicap. We want top quality production but we do not want to have to compete with people who are prepared to use anything.</P>

      <P>During his visit, did President Arafat raise with the Taoiseach the necessity for a viable Palestinian state to be established and that the viability of such a state would require a change in the proposed settlement in terms of the boundaries which are part and parcel of the peace accords? If he did so, did the Taoiseach give any undertaking to him in the light of an increased awareness that, whether we like it or not, the Israeli-Palestinian issue is being used by some people in Osama bin Laden's camp as a cause for fundamentalist terrorism coming from the Arab world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>President Arafat emphasised far more strongly than he did on previous occasions, not so much the change of lines or geographical locations but what Deputy Quinn said. What Deputy Quinn said is correct, that President Arafat's cause and the cause of his people <Col N="1494" /> is being used by groups with whom he does not want to be associated. He does not want them putting forward the Palestinian case. He obviously feels that was happening &ndash; he indicated to me he even suspected it before 11 September although obviously he did not have the precise details.</P>
      <P>He is also strongly of the view that the regions which his people controlled when I met him &ndash; even though that was only two weeks ago, five of those regions have now been taken over by Israeli troops following the death of the Israeli Minister for Tourism &ndash; should have autonomy, and that he would do his utmost to police those regions to control Hamas and all of the other groups to the very best of his ability. If allowed to do so &ndash; which was a <i>quid pro quo </i>on the stability of the security and peace for the Israeli people &ndash; that is all he is seeking to do. If the Palestinians can retain their regions, if they are not infiltrated on a continual basis and if his people are allowed to travel, he is prepared to go a long, long way in a very simplified agreement.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, President Arafat's major difficulty, apart from the huge invasion of his territory, is that the Palestinian people are not allowed travel to work in Israel. Their income base, which is being collected by the Israeli customs authorities, has not been passed on to him for more than a year. Most of the Palestinian officials, including the people who were travelling with him, had not been paid for several months. His whole economy cannot operate and essential services cannot operate. Therefore, the only way he can manage this situation is to try to hold on to what he has and try to get a sense of the position, particularly on Hebron, and to get some agreement.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, if I may explain this briefly to the House, he made it equally clear that, whereas he believed that Shimon Peres and he could speak even though they had all the difficulties in getting the meeting in Gaza some weeks ago, he is having no success, and there has been no real movement whatever, in getting any meaningful dialogue with Mr. Sharon, and that really has just stopped any meaningful progress. The EU and &ndash; according to what I know from the UN &ndash; the US were trying to broker initiatives but they have all now been set back following not only the assassination last week of the Israeli tourism Minister but the reaction of the Israelis to that atrocity.</P>

Will he raise the humanitarian aid issues resulting from the war on terror which is concentrated on Afghanistan at present and will he use his influence to create conditions whereby much needed and available aid would be allowed to the people who need it, either through safe corridors, through a temporary cessation of bombing to allow access or through an improvement in the situation which exists on the Pakistani border at <Col N="1495" /> present, where tens of thousands of refugees cannot gain access to Pakistan to receive aid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will take whatever opportunity I can in that regard. Over the years, in the EU and the UN, together with our partners, we have repeatedly called on the Taliban and other Afghan factions to respect basic human rights, to end gender discrimination and to introduce a broadly representative government. We must try to deal with the difficulties which exist and to establish a stable, legitimate and broadly representative administration and government which expresses the will of the people. There is a major humanitarian issue, not just for Afghan refugees who have crossed the border, but for Afghans still in the country.</P>
      <P>We have emphasised in the UN, and the EU last weekend, that we want a plan for the reconstruction of the country. That plan will take some time, but Ambassador Brahimi has been appointed. As an absolute priority, we have to maintain emergency humanitarian aid. Last week the EU cleared the necessary resources and programme &ndash; Javier Solana has been engaged in this &ndash; and this week on the Security Council we have been working towards delivery in that regard, with some success. I will emphasise that the UN focus on three areas, namely, delivery of humanitarian assistance, helping the Afghan people solve the political problems and assemble a new government, and move from relief work to reconstruction, rehabilitation and long-term development. I agree with Deputy Coveney that the most pressing issue now is humanitarian assistance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Commission has issued a conclusion on its report on the recommendation under Article 99(4) of the treaty and that indicates that the concerns on which the recommendation was based are no longer an issue for 2001.</P>
      <P>The report advises a cautious and careful budgetary approach in 2002 and I will study this advice. For obvious reasons, I cannot get into a discussion on the budget for 2002 &ndash; the Deputy will have to wait until 5 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as coping with the new situation is concerned, we need to avoid any weakening of Irish <Col N="1496" /> competitiveness on the cost front, to sustain investor and business confidence through continued prudent management of the public finances, to prioritise public spending towards programmes which improve the long-term capacity of the economy to benefit from the eventual improved conditions and to make further progress on structural and regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>In regard to public expenditure, against a background of strong economic growth in recent years the Government has been in a position to make considerable progress in providing necessary resources to deliver on key infrastructure priorities and its commitment to better public services. These priorities are reflected in its approach to multi-annual planning as set out in the NDP and PPF.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, when examining general Government expenditure as a share of national income, the figures show that the level of spending over the past three years has declined. General Government expenditure is the internationally comparable measure used by EUROSTAT and includes all elements of Government spending. While spending grew at a level which was necessary given the needs of a growing economy, it has risen by slightly less than GNP over the period as the economy grew at an unprecedented pace.</P>
    <P>In the current economic conditions, the Government is committed to effectively managing competing demands for increased public expenditure, while continuing to deliver on its key priorities.</P>

      <P>I do not agree, and it appears as if the EU does not now agree with what it recommended some months ago. We have had considerable economic progress in recent years, which has given us the economic largesse and budgetary surpluses to improve public services in a wide variety of areas. We have done that in areas such as health, social welfare and education. We have implemented the national development plan, which in 1999 prices amounted to £40.6 billion, and have improved public services in general. We have also been successful in reducing taxation. The cumulative changes in taxation and social welfare increases amounts to £5 billion over my four budgets. We have succeeded in reducing the national debt, which was 39% of GDP at the end of last year and is 34% or 35% this year, and we have put money aside for the pension reserve fund. All in all we have managed the economy very effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that at all. The policies pursued by the Government in recent years, together with the national social agreements which have been in vogue since 1987 and other factors have considerably improved the economy. The Deputy will be aware that the growth rates in my time in office have been unprecedented. The increase in GDP in 2000 over the previous year is the highest of any OECD country on record. This has allowed us do things in the public service area and to invest in a creaking infrastructure, which would not have been possible in the absence of economic success. The Deputy will know that I am strongly of the view that economic growth creates wealth which provides more money for the Exchequer, and that is the time to do the things one wants to do, and that when one does not have such funds one does not do such things.</P>

Now that the Minister needs to fuel the fire he does not have the necessary resources, which is a manifest failure on his part.</P>
      <P>Regarding infrastructural development, will the Minister accept that such are the delays in the national development plan, and such is the rate of inflation, that much less will be delivered in a much slower way than was first planned?</P>

The NDP does not just provide for sums of money but sets out what is to be achieved over the period of the plan, and the Government intends implementing it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of my view that the general economic textbook analysis does not apply to a small open economy such as Ireland, a view I have held for many years. The Deputy and others in Europe and further afield have said that the budget was expansionary in 2001. However, I suggest to them that if one agrees with this view, and further agrees with some economists who say the economy has been flat for the second half of the year, that textbook analysis is brought into contention with what applies to the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>In Exchequer terms, the budget day forecast was for a surplus of 3,222 million euro, or £2,538 million which was equivalent to 3.3% of GNP. The end September forecast was that the Exchequer surplus would be at least 1.9 billion euro, or £1.5 billion lower than the budget day forecast and possibly significantly more. These Exchequer figures exclude the proceeds from the new voluntary disclosure scheme and the sales of the TSB and the ICC.</P>
      <P>Last December, the forecast for 2001 economic growth, published in conjunction with the budget, was for an increase of 8.8% in GDP and of 7.4% in GNP. My Department's most recent forecast for 2001 economic growth, published in Economic Review and Outlook, is for an increase of 7.2% in GDP and an increase of 6% in GNP. This forecast was prepared in August 2001 and, therefore, does not take account of the impact of the events of 11 September in the United States on global and domestic economic activity. It is very difficult, just a month after the events, to assess the full economic impact of the attacks on Ireland's economic growth. Obviously much depends on the effects on the world economy as a whole and on reactions to the ongoing military response. My Department will, as usual, publish its estimates for economic growth with the budget.</P>
      <P>The economic environment has clearly altered radically compared to this time last year. Obviously the reduced tax base has implications going forward for increased tax revenue for surpluses and for debt. These factors are being examined in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the Taoiseach's prediction two days ago when launching the National Centre for Partnership and Performance that economic growth would be 3% this year? Will he agree that his Department's forecast of 6% growth made in the ERO in August is much too optimistic and that it is now virtually certain the economy is, in fact, technically in recession?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department and I make two forecasts on economic growth each year, one on the day of the budget and the other during the mid-term review published in August. The mid-term review estimated economic growth in GNP terms at 6% as of that date. I am also aware the Taoiseach recently anticipated that economic growth for the year might be of the order of 3%. On budget day, 5 December, I will give what I believe will be the outcome for 2001, including the estimate for 2002. I have read in recent weeks estimates for growth in the Irish economy in GNP terms for 2002 ranging from 1% to 6.5% across a range of private economists, some institutes and other bodies. Therefore, the jury is considerably out on what will be the economic growth for next year. Some people are of the view that the economy did not grow in recent months. However, as we publish quarterly economic statistics with a time lag, I will have to wait for some time to find out whether that is correct.</P>
      <P>For many years after the event there are revisions to Ireland's economic statistics by the Central Statistics Office. I agree with the Deputy that economic growth for the second half of the year was not anything like that predicted at budget time in December of last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the Taoiseach's prediction of 3% and assuming that growth would have been front loaded at the beginning of the year, does it not follow that we are now in recession in that the economy has almost certainly declined in the third quarter and will likely decline further in the fourth quarter of the year? On the Minister's starting budgetary position of a no policy change basis, is it not now the case, given what we know about the likely surplus for this year, that he will start with an Exchequer deficit? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday evening each year before the budget we publish on a no policy change basis the Estimates for the forthcoming year. This takes into account the Abridged Estimates volume which is published in December and our expectations on taxation for the following year. The Estimates will not be published until mid-November, followed by some budget day adjustments. We will have to wait until later <Col N="1500" /> to prognosticate what we estimate income will be. The Deputy is correct that the nine months Exchequer figures show tax revenue is not growing as anticipated at budget time, therefore, the basis on which we will build our estimate of taxation for next year will be considerably lower that was anticipated this time last year. Many variables will have to be considered when trying to predict what economic growth will be for next year. The eminent Mr. Greenspan said in the past fortnight that he was not in a position to predict what economic growth will be in the United States or anywhere else because matters are so uncertain. All these issues must be taken into account when making predictions for next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to make a prediction for next year. I am asking him, based on the three-quarter year returns, to tell us the opening position on a no policy change basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be a bit technical, but a no policy change basis is based on estimates of expenditure. Taxation matters on which one builds the other side of the budget depend on other factors such as the expected rate of economic growth and on what base one is building tax figures. It is too early to make a prediction on that basis. The overall surplus or deficit is the basis on which one makes estimates on those levels.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I publish multi-annual budgetary information on both voted current and capital services as part of the budget day documentation. In December last, I published information in relation to 2002 and 2003 in tables 4(a) and 5(a) of the budget book. These figures showed projected total voted spending in 2002 of 27,923 million (IR £21,991 million), an increase of 11.8% over 2001, based on the allocations for 2001 as set out in the budgetary arithmetic. The total projected increase was 2,960 million (IR£2,331 million). While a pay/non-pay breakdown of these projections is not published at budget time, I understand that just under one third of the total increase is related to pay, arising from increases in pay rates together with increased numbers, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are reviewed at various points throughout the year as technical parameters change and are currently being reviewed in the context of the Estimates discussions. These discussions will take account of the most up-to-date <Col N="1501" /> technical guidelines, that is, assumptions in relation to take-up of demand-led schemes, projections on inflation affecting the delivery of both current and capital services, demographic trends, public sector pay, etc.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate it would be inappropriate at this stage to make a statement on the matter in advance of the conclusion of the Estimates process. It is my intention to publish the Abridged Estimates volume, as usual, in November. Multi-annual projections for 2003 and 2004 will be published on budget day.</P>

At various stages throughout the year, particularly from April to June each year, the Department of Finance engages with other Departments in reviewing the no policy change projections made the previous autumn and winter &ndash; some adjustments are always made there &ndash; and a new understanding is arrived at under various schemes. We are currently engaged in the Estimates process which is a combination of no policy change projections and big demands from other line Departments.

The figure on a no policy change basis at that stage was 11.8%. The estimated one third increase would have related to pay. At that stage no assumption would have been made as to what would be the likelihood of the benchmarking process because the benchmarking review body will not report until mid-June 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a short meeting with the President of the Irish Bankers' Federation, Mr. John Collins, on 5 July. I gave a brief update on the state of play on the proposed new financial regulator, the Asset Covered Securities Bill, 2001, and the Dormant Accounts Bill, 2001. The substantive issue discussed at our meeting was the Code of Practice on Branch Restructuring: Customer Communications and Relations, developed by the Irish Bankers' Federation and the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association. I would remind the House that I have no statutory function in regard to decisions relating to the location or size of bank branch networks, which are the prerogative of credit institutions themselves. They must be free to make decisions on the maintenance, closure or opening of branches based on their own commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>The key elements of the code of practice in relation to branch restructuring include a minimum notice period of two months before bank branches would be closed and, in the interests of good customer and community relations, a commitment to give an explanation of the reasons for closing individual branches. The code was published on 16 July and copies are available from banks and from the IBF website. Retail banks and building societies have agreed to be bound by the code. I welcome the code of practice as a positive step towards alleviating some of the difficulties which arise when local banks close.</P>
      <P>I accept that banks must react to changing commercial circumstances and the opportunities offered by new technology, such as telephone and Internet banking. However, despite the commitment under the code of practice to begin a process of familiarising customers with alternative banking facilities, the way in which certain changes have recently been introduced by some banks is to be regretted. It is imperative that financial institutions have regard to the needs of all their customers but, in particular, the needs of vulnerable customers such as older people and those with disabilities. This point is one I intend to raise again with the banks and their representative bodies when I next have that opportunity.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will have a strong focus on consumer issues and, in that context, it would be appropriate for the new authority to monitor and report on access to banking services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the voluntary code published by the banks is seriously deficient in that, for example, it does not <Col N="1503" /> provide for any sort of consultation with local communities before banks decide to close a particular branch? Will he agree also that such is the weakness of the code it will provide little comfort to vulnerable communities and individuals who fear peremptory decisions to close their local branch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the code as published on 16 July, banks undertake to give a minimum of two months' notice and it would be the intention of banks to enter into some dialogue with local communities in that period of time. The code was published in the middle of the year in response to much disquiet among Members of the House, and the general public, on this topic. The code is a step forward. I do not have responsibility in this area, but I welcome the code as a significant step forward by the Irish Bankers' Federation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event that the voluntary code proves to be ineffective, as I fear may be the case, will the Minister give some consideration to the possibility of ascribing responsibility to the single regulator, whenever that office is established, to approve or otherwise applications from banks to close particular branches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I will ask the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which will have a strong focus on consumer issues, to monitor and report on access to banking services but banks cannot be required to maintain a level of services, no more than a supermarket or a petrol station can be told to do so, regardless of commercial realities. It is not possible to do that. We could not bring in a law to force banks, irrespective of commercial realities, to do certain functions no more than we could force a shop to remain open in some town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that we cannot and should not look to oblige a bank to maintain a loss-making business, but that has not been the case with a number of the recent branch closures. It has simply been a matter of maximising profits and given the strategic importance of banking in rural Ireland, and to the economy as a whole, that is something we should not easily tolerate. On the other issue, does the Minister share my concern about the withdrawal of certain counter services by the banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had noticed that all the financial institutions are trying to discourage people from coming into their organisations, but the banks must be left free to deal, as they see fit, with competition that has been forced upon them. Many of the new entrants to the financial market in Ireland are banks that are providing services through the Internet or other electronic means, and that implies that they do not need a plethora of branches as do the ordinary institutions. The banks and the other institutions must compete <Col N="1504" /> with that reality in the marketplace. The code of practice will endeavour to create a type of halfway house in that there will be consultation and dialogue and due notice given. When there is a great deal of hassle in some areas, and I have experienced this over a 25 year period in public life, banks often consider that what they intended to do in the first place is not worth it. The commercial reality is that new entrants to the market do not have a wide branch network and, therefore, they can have a lower cost base. The banks must be allowed to compete with those institutions as well. We would all like to go back to the days when one could go into the bank to see one's friendly bank manager once a year, the doctor would turn up at one's house at 2.00 p.m. or 2.00 a.m. and if one rang one's solicitor, he would come out to the house. The only person left in Ireland providing that service is a TD.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006, NDP, provided for public investment of £40.6 billion, or 51.6 billion, in 1999 prices. In 2001 prices, the cost of the NDP as published is estimated at £47.6 billion or 60.4 billion. This estimate is based on the increases in construction prices for 2000 and 2001 contained in Construction Industry Review 2000/Outlook 2001-2003, which was published recently by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and on the actual increase in the consumer price index for 2000 and my Department's forecast for 2001.</P>
      <P>An exercise similar to that used to estimate the cost of the total NDP at 2001 prices has been carried out in respect of 2002 based on projected average price increases, which shows that the cost of the NDP in 2002 prices would be of the order of £50 billion or 63.5 billion.</P>
      <P>I accept that inflation in the construction sector has been in excess of that anticipated at the time the plan was prepared. However, there are clear indications of a significant easing of construction industry inflation on foot of the general economic slowdown. This will assist a better return in terms of output for plan investment in the infrastructure area. It should be borne in mind that the NDP is a seven year plan.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the implementation of the NDP, particularly the infrastructure programme which is crucial to the future competitiveness of the economy and thus to Ireland's continued economic and social progress.</P>

Will he slow them down or pull some projects? What efforts will he make to seek additional funding from the Exchequer to ensure that the projects named go ahead?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The NDP is a project related plan. We have singled out the projects which will be part of the plan, and the Deputy will have noticed that the plan acknowledged that the yearly provisions to fund the plan would have to take account of the prevailing economic and budgetary situation. The Deputy is correct in that the cost of the total NDP at 2001 prices in respect of 2002 would be of the order of £50 billion. That is a 25% increase over the £40.6 billion. That is based on the review conducted and published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Construction Industry Review 2000/Outlook 2002-2003. Inflation in the construction sector, therefore, in the past number of years has been considerably higher than the general inflation in the economy, but in recent times there has been an easing of construction inflation due to the general economic slowdown. The plan is a project based plan spread out over a seven year period and, therefore, those projects will be completed. I hope that inflation in the construction sector will be lower in future years so that the overall cost plan will not increase in line with the figures for this year.</P>

      <P>I agree the completion of the national development plan is very important for the progress of the economy. When the economic upturn comes, we need to be in a position to benefit from it. The funding of the £40.6 billion for the national development plan was over a number of areas. A small percentage comes from the European Union &ndash; roughly 10%. A percentage also comes from the public private partnership process and the remainder was to be funded through the Exchequer. A combination of those three factors will complete the national development plan, which was subject to overall budgetary and financial constraints.

He is, undoubtedly, aware that all disciplinary procedures must be conducted in accordance with the Civil Service disciplinary code, including the appeal process provided for under the code. Such proceedings can be very protracted, especially when the appeal provisions of the code are invoked. Every action in this area has to have full regard to the requirements of natural justice and fair procedures. With regard to any officer in any Department or office who is suspended from duty, the relevant legislation &ndash; the Civil Service Regulations Act 1956 &ndash; provides for the payment of a portion of an officer's salary, for the mitigation of hardship, on application from the officer. Such payments are intended to allow an officer to maintain his or her family, rather than as a form of remuneration.</P>

      <P>It was my understanding that trade unions would not seek to represent somebody who has admitted criminal responsibility. Does the Minister agree there is no place, especially in the Revenue, for entertaining any leniency where there is criminality involved, because of the message that sends to other officers in such an important organisation?</P>

      <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established in July 2000 and was asked to report by 30 June 2002. It was agreed by the parties that there would be four phases: Phase 1 &ndash; written submission by the parties; Phase 2 &ndash; research by the body itself; Phase 3 &ndash; oral hearings and any further written submissions based on the research and Phase 4 &ndash; finalisation of the report by the body. Written submissions were made by the parties earlier this year. The body has now carried out its research of the public service grades being examined. The research in the private sector is taking place. Oral hearings for each group, where both sides will have the opportunity to put arguments in support of their case, began earlier this month and will continue into December. It is expected the body will then begin drafting its report, after the oral hearings are complete, with a view to finalising it by the end of June 2002. There will not be an interim report, nor will the body issue recommendations on individual groups or grades on a rolling basis. Rather, there will be one report at the end of the process. This was agreed by both the unions and the employers and is contained in the body's terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have given my views on the Tobin tax issue on several occasions, most recently in reply to a written parliamentary question put down by Deputy Proinsias De Rossa on 3 October.</P>
      <P>In its currently proposed form, the tax would impose a world wide tax on all foreign exchange transactions to reduce exchange rate volatility and to raise revenue to support international development. However, this is easier said than done, because many difficulties have been identified by commentators in relation to the tax.</P>
      <P>A recent, major report &ndash; the Zedillo report &ndash; that was commissioned by the UN Secretary General to examine the issue of development finance concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;the merits of a currency transaction tax remain highly controversial.&rdquo; The report stated, &ldquo;further rigorous study is needed before any definitive conclusion is reached on the feasibility and convenience of a Tobin tax.&rdquo; In November 2000, a report from the Finnish Ministry of Finance also pointed to the many problems associated with the Tobin tax proposal.</P>
      <P>The issue of the Tobin tax was discussed at the informal ECOFIN meeting at Liege on 22 September. The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However, most finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal and it is not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission will ensure satisfactory answers are given to the many real questions concerning the tax including, and not least of which, are the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, at the most recent formal ECOFIN meeting on 16 October, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would, among other <Col N="1510" /> things, examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for Aer Lingus rests with my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, Minister for Public Enterprise. Yesterday, the Minister gave a comprehensive reply to the House outlining the position adopted by the Government in relation to the Aer Lingus viability plan.</P>
      <P>I have had an involvement in the provision of emergency insurance cover for airlines, airport operators and service providers. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the US, the insurance industry decided to withdraw insurance cover for war risk at short notice. This would have grounded all airlines unless some alternative form of cover could be provided. Arising from this, the informal ECOFIN meeting, in Liege on 22 September, which I attended, adopted a set of guiding principles on intervention for insurance problems by airline companies.</P>
      <P>Under the guiding principles, member states were authorised to provide liability cover to airline companies to address the short-term failure in the commercial insurance market. The guidelines provided that a &ldquo;reasonable premium&rdquo; should be charged for this cover, though it was agreed that this could be waived in the short term and finally, it was agreed that schemes should be introduced initially for a period of one month with work continuing on a sustainable solution to encourage industry to return to the market as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In accordance with these guidelines, the Government approved the issue of a letter of comfort to the Irish licensed airlines, airport operators and service providers, which provided cover for war risks for an initial period of 30 days, subject to certain limits. The Government also gave a commitment to introduce appropriate covering legislation as soon as possible. The preparation of this legislation is being pursued by the Department of Public Enterprise as a top priority. The course of action followed by Ireland is broadly in line with the approach taken in other member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of state aid, my only involvement with this matter related to airline insurance. This came up at the informal ECOFIN meeting on 22 September. A few days before that insurance companies informed airlines that they were no longer willing to cover them from the following Monday night. Due to the colossal figures that could be involved, this was dealt with at the informal ECOFIN meeting and we issued a statement setting out the guiding principles.</P>
      <P>Over that weekend, my departmental officials liaised with officials at the Department of Public Enterprise and arising from that a letter of comfort was issued to airlines and service providers in Ireland regarding insurance. At that informal ECOFIN meeting, the guiding principles were laid out in such a way that even the provision of airline insurance would not contravene state aid and that was the context in which state aid was discussed. After the meeting, some Ministers gave their views on state aid in the general context of airlines.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Department of Public Enterprise along with the Minister and the Commission have been dealing with the general Aer Lingus problem and I have not been involved in that.</P>

      <P>I reiterate the point made by Deputy McDowell. The intransigence and unbelievable stand of the European Commission will make it much more difficult for this country to reverse the decision on the Nice treaty. It has reinforced the impression that it is completely out of touch with reality.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that Aer Lingus is now suffering from an act of war, so declared by the United States government and its other allies? Does he accept that the European Commission is using competition rules to ignore this act of war and its consequences for Aer Lingus? Does he accept that the demise of Aer Lingus and other European airlines would be yet another trophy for the terrorists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that selling Aer Lingus or part thereof in present circumstances is a forced sale, the proceeds of which are bound to be inadequate to meet the survival needs of Aer Lingus? In consequence, does he accept the Government should seek from the European Commission a once and for all change in the law specifically to deal with the consequences of 11 September so that there could be no suit on competition grounds except in connection with 11 September. Bearing in mind the Commission has <Col N="1512" /> asked us to pass seven Bills before Christmas, is it not reasonable to ask it to change the competition rules in this specific instance?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has addressed this matter in the House on many occasions in recent days. Yesterday she spent an hour and 40 minutes answering questions. The Taoiseach dealt with this matter this morning on the Order of Business and on previous occasions. We have outlined the proposal put to Government yesterday and the Government's strategy. It is in everybody's interest to ensure we have a viable Aer Lingus in the future. As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise have repeatedly said, that debate on Aer Lingus will continue into the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. How advanced are negotiations with the relevant <Col N="1513" /> social partners, especially the Civil Service unions? Is there an evaluation group within the Department of Finance to consider and assess the submissions made including the comprehensive one under the aegis of Westmeath County Council which involved the trades unions, Mullingar town commission and all the social partners including the Chamber of Commerce? If decisions have not been made why did the Taoiseach rule out Mullingar on 5 October, despite a significant submission made by the town? It has caused morale in the town to fall and in County Westmeath, especially when Mullingar is the only major town in the midlands not to have had the benefit of decentralisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. A former candidate for the constituency of Westmeath was a close school friend of mine, as Deputy Penrose is probably aware. He was elected to the House for a short period. No decision has been made on decentralisation, whether it be in terms of the towns, villages or areas selected or the bodies or Departments to be relocated. In recent days I understand a Deputy in my party, not from the constituency of Westmeath, issued a statement to the local newspapers to the effect that following his consultation with the Minister for Finance, a certain body was to be relocated to a certain part of the country. I have not seen the Deputy since the start of the Dáil session. No area has been ruled in or out.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service unions were part of the consultative process but they are not involved in the decision making. A Cabinet sub-committee, comprising the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and me, has been formed to consider the issue but the Government will make the final decisions. I assure Deputies and Senators on all sides that no location has been ruled in or out, despite statements to the contrary from Deputies on the Opposition and Government side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Following initial submissions by many towns, the CSO published its population projections for the next 20 to 25 years. Is the Minister aware that the midlands is the one <Col N="1514" /> region projected to suffer population decline, of approximately 25,000? Would he consider that this should be an important factor in deciding where Departments may be decentralised? Since all the midland towns have had the benefit of decentralisation with the exception of Mullingar does he not consider it outrageous for the Taoiseach to recently announce that the town is not even to be considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given me news of which I was unaware. The Taoiseach has visited most constituencies in the country and I must obtain local reports of his visit to Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must examine the relevant reports. I am aware from various studies that a certain part of the midlands is the one area in the country not to have benefited from economic progress. The midlands comprises a broad geographic area and some parts have done very well. Other parts, closer to my county, have not benefited and have experienced levels of emigration and deprivation worse than most parts of the country.</P>
      <P>More than one criterion will be used when reaching decisions in this area. The factors raised by Deputy McGrath will be taken into consideration. No decisions have been made on what towns have been included or excluded, or if they have nobody has told me as the Minister in charge.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, often to my cost, I am inclined to fulfil my promises. I promised to have the programme of decentralisation up and running but I am disappointed I have not been in a position to finalise it. Many of the difficulties to which the Deputies referred in a jocose manner impinge on final decisions being made. It is the Government's intention to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I made the original announcement in December 1999, the case for decentralisation is <Col N="1515" /> now even more compelling. Deputies Penrose and McGrath, who travel to Dublin city centre every week, will be aware of this. Trade union leaders will be even more surprised to find that the level of interest among their members in moving out of Dublin is far greater than they would have anticipated. People see many advantages to living in the country in terms of a better lifestyle and better facilities. There is a great expectation among public servants about the issue. There is greater expectation in parts of the country and even greater among Deputies and Senators in terms of the areas to be included. The issue presents problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the record of the Government in this area is off-putting, to say the least? The unilateral decision by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to transfer to Legal Aid Board to Cahirciveen, agreed to by the Minister, was made to suit local party convenience rather than taking account of the service to the public or the concerns of the staff, for whom it is a very big issue. Will the Minister assure the House that areas will not be selected solely because they are located in marginal constituencies and regardless of what may happen after the general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must defend my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and, by imputation myself, regarding the transfer of the Legal Aid Board. It is a small organisation and given current developments in technology, there is no reason it could not be located in any part of the country. Decisions on decentralisation will not be made on the basis referred to by the Deputy. That happened in the past. For example, it may be nothing more than a coincidence that parts of the then Department of Agriculture were moved to Wexford when Deputy Yates was Minister for Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency was also moved to Wexford, the home of the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin. I can provide other examples. We intend to have a programme of decentralisation that makes sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair to construe from the open answers by the Minister, which we have come to expect, that the headline in the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i> stating that cold water had been thrown on the idea of Mullingar getting a decentralised Department can be ignored and that in terms of Mullingar and other worthy applicants being selected, it is all to play for?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>

      <P>The Economic and Finance Council met on 16 October 2001 and also held a joint session with the Justice and Home Affairs Council later that day. The Council did not meet in conjunction with the Ghent Summit. The two main issues of current interest discussed at the ECOFIN meeting were the arrangements for reinsurance of aviation and measures to counter the financing of terrorism. Both issues arose in the aftermath of the events of 11 September. On reinsurance, the general issue of support for the airline industry in consequence of 11 September was being debated at the Transport Council, which ran concurrently to the ECOFIN meeting. In that context ECOFIN, while underlining the need to act in concert with the Transport Council, favoured a monthly review of the insurance measures in the member states with a definitive time limit for expiry of those measures by the end of December 2001.</P>
      <P>Regarding the financing of terrorism, the Council agreed a package of sanctions against international terrorism, including the importance of an early adoption of the draft directive on market abuse and the freezing of funds belonging to states, organisations or individuals suspected of terrorist connections. This approach was supported by the conclusions agreed later that day of the joint ECOFIN-Justice and Home Affairs Council on measures to be taken in the fight against terrorism, money laundering and financial crime.</P>
      <P>Other subjects discussed in the ECOFIN Council included the employment package, proposals for a directive on the activities of institutions for occupational retirement provision and the directive on money laundering. The Council also adopted a statement for the Ghent European Council meeting on the preparation for change-over to the euro. Lunch time discussions included consideration of the general economic situation and of further means of combating the financing of terrorism. The discussions also included a debriefing on the G7 Finance Ministers' recent meeting and on the Eurogroup meeting of the previous evening.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell the House <Col N="1517" /> if it has been established beyond doubt that European stock markets were abused in the days coming up to 11 September to make profits for those associated with the atrocity in New York? Arising from discussions at the ECOFIN meeting, has agreement been reached on measures to be taken to prevent such abuses in future? Have measures been taken here to further the aim of the Council in freezing the assets of terrorist groups?</P>

      <P>The subject of the suspected use of stock markets prior to the events of 11 September was briefly referred to at the Eurogroup meeting. An investigation is under way in Europe and the United States of America. These things are very difficult to prove. As further information comes to light it will be reported upon and we will all know about it. Nobody can state definitively that there was abuse or that there was not, however it is widely suspected that there was, as the Deputy knows from international news reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Without that constant support over many years of successive Governments, it would not have been possible to achieve the progress that has been made. On behalf of the Taoiseach and my other colleagues in Government, I express our deep appreciation for that consensus support which sustained us on the bad days and encouraged us on the good. The events of yesterday were enormously significant and 23 October 2001 will rank among the seminal moments of the peace process over the past decade. It joins other milestones of hope such as the Downing Street Declaration, the framework documents, the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of its institutions in December 1999. Many of these occasions were marked by debates and statements in this House and it is entirely appropriate that we should accord similar respect to yesterday's developments. I know that party leaders have already issued public statements welcoming the IICD report and I thank them for their generous and gracious recognition of the importance of what has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the IICD confirmed it had witnessed an event it regarded as significant during which the IRA had put a quantity of arms completely beyond use, including arms, ammunition and explosives. As the Government statement indicated, this represents unprecedented progress in the resolution of the arms issue. To fully appreciate the shift involved, we need to bear in mind that the IRA did not consider itself to be party to the Good Friday Agreement. In the immediate aftermath of those negotiations it issued a statement to the effect that there would not be decommissioning. That statement received pithy expression in the murals which appeared in the republican areas stating &ldquo;not a bullet, not an ounce&rdquo;. Therefore, we should not underestimate the enormity of the move made by the IRA yesterday. It required vision and courage to take that step, particularly against a backdrop of a sustained campaign of violence directed against <Col N="1520" /> nationalists in north Belfast, Larne, Coleraine and other areas in Northern Ireland. As Prime Minister Mr. Blair said yesterday, this step was taken not out of weakness but from the strength that comes from recognising that there is now a new dispensation in Northern Ireland which allows political differences to be addressed and resolved through democratic and peaceful debate. I commend Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and the Sinn Féin leadership for the influential role they have played in bringing militant republicanism to this new departure.</P>
    <P>The issue of decommissioning has long been an obstacle in the peace process. It nearly frustrated the establishment of multi-party talks in 1996 and was one of the most difficult issues on the agenda of those talks.</P>
    <P>Even after agreement had been achieved, it proved to be one of the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement that was most difficult to implement. This is perfectly understandable since the issue of decommissioning goes to the heart of the deficit of trust and confidence that has existed in Northern Ireland. Both sides regarded the issue as the litmus test for the <i>bona fides</i> of the other &ndash; if the war is over, a private army is not needed, and conversely, if the guns are silent, why the insistence that they should be handed in?</P>
    <P>As we have grappled with this issue over the past few years, the wisdom and prescience of Senator Mitchell's words in 1996 have been continuously validated &ndash; the decommissioning of mindsets is as important as the decommissioning of weapons. What we have been doing patiently and incrementally over several years is creating a context that allows us to decommission the mindsets of those who regarded violence as a legitimate instrument for pursuing political objectives and also those who sought to maintain supremacy under a guise of partnership. The decommissioning of the mindsets was a prior condition of the decommissioning of the weapons. The necessary context was the Good Friday Agreement and its full and total implementation.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, the Governments and the pro-Agreement parties have devoted thousands of hours of dialogue and negotiation to achieve that context. The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair have made a huge personal investment of time and energy in pursuing that task. The Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, has done Herculean work in advancing matters, particularly on the policing issue on which great progress has been made in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The leaders of all of the pro-Agreement parties have stretched themselves and their constituencies repeatedly in order to facilitate progress. John Hume, Seamus Mallon, Mark Durkan, David Trimble, Reg Empey, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness all deserve immense credit for their political courage and stamina. The leaders of the smaller parties in the Assembly, including the Alliance, the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition and the PUP, were also very helpful in <Col N="1521" /> creating a climate of support for the context we were seeking to achieve.</P>
    <P>The required context was finally brought to fruition with the publication on 1 August, following the talks at Weston Park, of the two Governments' proposals on addressing the outstanding issues from the Good Friday Agreement: putting arms beyond use; normalising security arrangements on the ground in Northern Ireland; establishing a policing service that attracts and sustains cross-community support; and ensuring the stability and inclusive operation of the Agreement's political institutions. Yesterday's developments provided the catalyst that allowed us to fully deliver on all of those outstanding dimensions of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the events of yesterday would not have been possible without militant republicanism acquiring the vision and generosity to stretch itself for the public good, without the creation of a political context that enabled that shift, and without the various political leaders on these islands who took risks repeatedly. Neither would it have been possible without the professionalism, integrity and endurance of General John de Chastelain and his colleagues on the IICD.</P>
    <P>The international community has been an immense resource to the peace process over the last decade. The IICD has been able to draw on the best and the brightest from Canada, the US and Finland to break the impasse on the most difficult issue in the process. I am delighted to tell the House that the current US administration is maintaining the close engagement demonstrated by President Clinton when he was in office. We are very fortunate to be able to call on the fair and even-handed support of Ambassador Richard Haass, to whom I spoke yesterday, Secretary of State Colin Powell, who I briefed in Washington recently, and President George W. Bush, who stated very significantly that the peace process in Northern Ireland represented a national interest for the US. Notwithstanding their current preoccupation with Afghanistan, Ambassador Haass and the Secretary of State devoted considerable time yesterday to the unfolding events here, and President Bush issued a very supportive statement welcoming the IICD verification and expressing the hope that it would lead &ldquo;to the full functioning of the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The significance of yesterday's events has been generously recognised by the vast majority of people on these islands. There is, alas, a small minority of sirenic voices who wish to degrade yesterday's achievement and keep the issue open as a potential brake in the further working out of the peace process. I fully share Prime Minister Blair's views in this regard &ndash; we must not let the wreckers or the cynics win. Those who seek to destroy the Agreement by force or intimidation will be dealt with severely by the forces of law and order in both parts of the island. Moreover, those who dismiss the significance of the IICD <Col N="1522" /> verification will confirm suspicions that their ultimate agenda is resistance to change rather than resolution of the arms issue.</P>
    <P>The 23 October was the day on which we collectively drew a line under the difficulties in implementing the Good Friday Agreement and resolved to get on with finishing the job. There is now no substantive reason we should not continue delivering all the commitments contained in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement was a profound charter for change, democratically endorsed in both parts of the island. Through its outworking, it has already achieved a great deal. However, a great deal more needs to be done if the promise and full dividend of the Agreement is to be made real in the lives of the people in North Belfast, the Falls Road, the Shankill, Portadown, South Armagh, the Waterside in Derry and places in between. For instance, the people of South Armagh need to see visible evidence of change. It is hard to believe the war is over if one lives under a military watch-tower and has to endure daily intrusions by the British Army. I understand that the Secretary of State intends to make some announcements in this regard in the House of Commons this afternoon. This important work has begun today.</P>
    <P>The Government and all parties in this House attach particular importance to the stable and inclusive operation of the institutions of the Agreement and, in particular, its North-South architecture. The reason for that is very simple. If we are to build a future on this island that is different from the past then a cornerstone of that must be a new partnership between North and South and between all traditions on the island.</P>
    <P>The North-South Ministerial Council and the North-South bodies have made an impressive start to their work since they were brought into being in December 1999. Without exception all meetings of the council have taken place in a positive, constructive atmosphere and an extensive programme of work is under way across the various sectors involved. The North-South bodies and the new tourism company, Tourism Ireland, are up and running and getting on with their important mandates.</P>
    <P>We all know that, despite the progress, some difficulties in the wider political process spilled over into the workings of the North-South institutions. However, thanks to the groundbreaking developments of this week, these difficulties can now be put behind us and we will be free to press on with the many tasks that need to be done in North-South terms.</P>
    <P>This breaking of the logjam at last releases the full possibilities of the North-South institutions. Despite the wider political difficulties, which I have mentioned, they have already demonstrated their tremendous potential, with 37 successful meetings of the council held to date and up to 1,000 staff, drawn from North and South, working effectively in the new bodies and in Tourism Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> However, this is not just a paper exercise or a symbolic gesture. These are relevant institutions and structures which deal with critical issues that matter to all the people on this island &ndash; issues such as special education, emergency health care, cross-Border trade, road safety and tourism promotion.</P>
    <P>In this new climate, the North-South provisions of the Agreement can yield some of the most positive, practical benefits for the people of this island. The structures give us the opportunity to tackle our common concerns and objectives in a new, strategic way, opening up the possibility of a genuine all-island approach to issues when it makes obvious sense. Everyone has something to gain from this approach.</P>
    <P>It should now be possible for us to take our planning forward in a genuine spirit of partnership in key areas such as the environment, tourism, spatial strategy, transport and energy. Even where some of these issues are outside the current remit of the North-South Ministerial Council, such as energy, the dynamic of North-South co-operation has progressed to such a degree and the level of Ministerial interaction is now so advanced that I firmly believe these key policy areas will never again be examined or taken forward in a purely 26-County or Six-County mind-set.</P>
    <P>This transformation is possible if these structures are developed and utilised to the full. No one can claim that they are being misused as some sort of cloaking device for a political agenda. The agenda is open and clear. Against the constitutional background set out in the Agreement, we need to overcome the fact that the political border on this island has been economically disruptive and socially and culturally divisive to the hindrance and detriment of all for far too long. Everyone must recognise by now that working together is to our mutual benefit. Under the terms of the Agreement, all of these activities are carried out in co-operation with our Northern Ministerial partners, so there can be nothing to suspect or fear.</P>
    <P>There is now a dynamic agenda for action. We hope to hold an early plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council to progress important work on practical issues such as the tackling of obstacles to mobility between both parts of the island, developing common approaches to economic competitiveness and re-energising the programmes of work in the individual sectors of the council. On the part of the North-South bodies, InterTradelreland has a major programme of activity ahead in terms of promoting greater trade and business links and interaction between North and South. Tourism Ireland is proceeding with tackling the huge challenges that have arisen in seeking to market the island overseas in the wake of the horrific events of 11 September, a task that can only be made easier by this new strategic partnership.</P>
    <P>This is but a flavour of what lies ahead. The <Col N="1524" /> common theme through all this is mutuality of interest. Across a range of areas there is a deep mutuality of interest between North and South. We must set about, through the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and through other linkages, turning this potential into reality. In doing so, we must harness the new energy and maturity which has been released by this week's developments and begin a new dynamic era on this island at all levels based on partnership, equality and mutual respect.</P>
    <P>For too long we have lived back to back on this small island, cut off from one another. It is time for us to start working side by side on the basis of respect for the diversity of our traditions and for the constitutional architecture set down in the Good Friday Agreement in the common interest of all our people. That is a challenge for everyone on this island which we must now take on and meet.</P>
    <P>Last week Archbishop Eames spoke, perhaps prophetically, about the response to decommissioning being as important as decommissioning itself. He said what was needed was a change in attitude, a movement of minds. Yesterday's developments enable that change and movement. They allow us to recapture the spirit of Good Friday 1998, to re-dedicate ourselves to the task of implementing its provisions in full, to be generous to erstwhile opponents, to believe again in the transforming power of democratic politics, to recognise that a context now exists on the island which allows us all to pursue freely our legitimate goals and aspirations, and to forswear the use of violence and intimidation for the achievement of any political purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report last evening by General de Chastelain's Independent International Commission on Decommissioning is one of the most important documents issued in recent times about events on the island. I congratulate and thank all those who contributed to making it possible. In circumstances such as these, it is invidious to single out one or more parties, but it is appropriate on this occasion to recognise a number of contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long been a critic of the republican movement in both its political and military manifestations. In my first ministerial position as Minister for Justice I found myself having to cope with the fundamental challenge the IRA posed not just to peace and stability in Northern Ireland but to the foundations of the State. It is against this background that I commend the courage which lies behind the statement issued by the IRA yesterday afternoon. I do not for one moment doubt the difficulties which yesterday's initiative has caused for the organisation, its volunteers and supporters. The IRA has put a quantity of arms, ammunition and explosives completely beyond use, and this has been verified by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. It has done so, in its words, to save the peace process and persuade others of its <Col N="1525" /> genuine intentions. I recognise the courage and generosity of its decision.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the role played by Sinn Féin in using its influence to achieve IRA decommissioning. It is clear the part played by the Sinn Féin leadership was essential in ensuring the breakthrough of 23 October 2001.</P>
    <P>There are many others without whose patience and dedication the statements of yesterday would simply not have been possible. Our sincere thanks go to the distinguished members of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning &ndash; Tauno Nieminen, John de Chastelain and Andrew D. Sens. Their technical expertise, their diplomatic skills and, above all, their patience helped to make it happen. They have inspired almost universal confidence. I hope they take some reward from the fact that Irish men and women of almost all shades of political opinion, together with the United States Administration and the British and Irish Governments, have accepted their report without hesitation and without question. The confidence and trust we all have in the members of the commission was well placed. I know everyone in the House will join me in sending them our heartfelt thanks.</P>
    <P>I also recognise the contribution of the political parties in Northern Ireland who worked so hard to bring about the Good Friday Agreement and who have worked ever since to ensure its complete implementation. There have been difficulties along the way and no doubt there will be more in future, but the commitment of all the pro-Agreement parties together with the political skills and doggedness they have shown is part of the background which made yesterday possible.</P>
    <P>The role of the US Administration is also deserving of our thanks, all the more so when we bear in mind the appalling trauma with which President Bush and his colleagues have had to deal since the atrocities of 11 September.</P>
    <P>Last but not least I congratulate the two Governments and their officials for their hard work, ingenuity and, above all, for never giving up. I recognise the personal contribution made on this side of the water by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and assure them that, in the ongoing work to achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, they will continue to enjoy the support of my party.</P>
    <P>There is some unfinished business and, while this is not the day for dwelling on that, I cannot let the occasion pass without asking for early decommissioning by the loyalist paramilitaries. I hope not only will weapons be decommissioned but, more importantly, that mindsets will be decommissioned and that the appalling events at the Holy Cross school in Ardoyne and the attacks on Catholic families in north Belfast and throughout Northern Ireland will end immediately.</P>
    <P>I look forward to further progress on the outstanding issues identified in the Weston Park statement by both Governments on 1 August last. <Col N="1526" /> Given the generosity of the initial response to IRA decommissioning by David Trimble and his colleagues and by the British Government, the scene is set for better days ahead than we have seen for a long time. The people of Ireland, North and South, have waited a long time for these better days. We must never forget that it is the express will of all the people who voted in the referendums that the Good Friday Agreement be the blueprint for the foreseeable future. For Nationalists and republicans the Good Friday Agreement has replaced the 1918 general election results. For Unionists and loyalists, the Good Friday Agreement gives them new and powerful guarantees for their future. All the people have an opportunity which they have never had before. They have an agreed framework within which to work. If it works well, the affairs of this island will be dealt with by people who live in Ireland, whose roots are deep here, whose interest is exclusively Irish and whose future is Irish.</P>
    <P>There will be differences. The two major Irish traditions, Nationalist and Unionist, will continue, at least initially, to face in different directions. The Good Friday Agreement allows for and accommodates that. It also provides for institutions within Northern Ireland, between both parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain which will work to achieve the common interests of all people on these islands. I know everyone will work the institutions to ensure maximum results. In doing so, differences will be aired and agreement will not always come easily. However, in the process the best Irish brains will be brought to bear on the issues of the day. We will learn from one another and what we will learn will benefit us as we move forward to deal eventually with longer-term and more intractable issues.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the developments of 23 October and hope the date will become as memorable for all that is positive and good as 11 September has become for all that is negative and bad. Ireland needed 23 October. Now that we have it, it is vital we grasp the opportunities it provides with enthusiasm and in a spirit of constructiveness and imagination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday's announcement by General de Chastelain that he had witnessed a significant act of decommissioning on the part of the IRA is without doubt a critical and important event. The IRA can finally stand proud that it has at last begun to accede to the democratically expressed wishes of the people of Ireland, North and South. Some may say the IRA was never party to the Good Friday Agreement, but Sinn Féin, its political wing, clearly was. Notwithstanding who did or did not negotiate the Good Friday Agreement, all Irish people were duty-bound to comply with its terms when it was endorsed by the people. The IRA has no basis to exempt itself from this principle which binds us all. For the IRA it is a case of better late than never. It is important that the republican movement's act breaks the logjam in the peace process and opens <Col N="1527" /> up to the Northern Ireland people the full opportunities of peaceful and democratic politics.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the events of recent days were carefully choreographed and that choreography must continue. The IRA's decision places a clear onus on Unionists of all varieties to respond. Mr. Trimble did so by agreeing to re-appoint Ministers from his party to the Executive. Loyalists paramilitaries now have a short window of opportunity to respond. They have always maintained that they hold weapons in response to the threat posed by the provisional IRA. That excuse never cut it and it certainly will not cut it now. There never was, and no longer remains, any justification for holding on to weapons. Failure to decommission now will copperfasten the view that the main driving force behind loyalist paramilitarism is not now, nor ever has been, to represent or defend, however wrongfully, their political community. Failure to decommission will remove the veneer, however thin, from criminal gangs.</P>
      <P>For the Democratic Unionist Party, the challenge is greater as it has not played a constructive role in this process. If it is big enough now it will recognise that the tactics pursued by Mr. Trimble and his party will accord to the Unionist community greater security and safety than would ever be possible outside the Agreement's framework. In short, it is time for the &ldquo;big man&rdquo; to be a big man. The same applies to Mr. Trimble's detractors within the Ulster Unionist Party. What they claimed he could not achieve has been achieved. It is time now for them to offer their support for his re-election as First Minister.</P>
      <P>To his supporters within the party, whose commitment to an inclusive settlement has been consistent, a particular tribute is due. While I have been critical of Mr. Trimble's attitude to the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, we all must recognise that without his preparedness to jump first, at Mr. Adams's invitation, and allow the institutions to be established we would not be where we are today.</P>
      <P>To Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, I say &ldquo;well done.&rdquo; It is unfortunate that the process was almost brought to its knees before action was taken, but neither do I underestimate the difficulties posed to them by yesterday's decision. It is one thing to talk about the new realities in the aftermath of 11 September, it is another to deliver on them. One can only hope that the republican community will recognise that it is with peace that its political and economic future lies, and that the decision taken yesterday by their representatives was a brave one. These people have lived too long with disadvantage. To some extent, it was inflicted on them by their own champions in the conflict, but it is now surely time to build a better and more prosperous future in which a struggle for scarcity does not divide communities as it has for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politics did not end with yesterday's decision. I continue to hold different views from republicans <Col N="1528" /> on core issues. I do not recognise their right to describe themselves as republicans to the exclusion of the rest of us, nor do I share their vision for Ireland, and I do not intend to buy into their re-writing of history. I recognise, too, that much of the language used yesterday was for a particular republican constituency at a particular republican moment, so it is not appropriate to take up that debate here. My hope, and what yesterday began to make possible, is that we can debate our collective future free from the threat of guns and armies.</P>
    <P>Naturally and understandably, attention was focused yesterday on the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin. It has been a long journey for them and they have some distance still to travel. However, credit is due to others who were not so high profile. Irish and British Governments of every hue played their part and that should be recognised also. However, when times were difficult it was the SDLP, particularly John Hume and Seamus Mallon, who argued consistently the case for consensus and mutual respect. They did so when neither Unionists nor republicans were prepared to listen. As John Hume and Seamus Mallon approach their retirement at the forthcoming SDLP conference, yesterday's events are their legacy to the community which they served for over 30 years.</P>
    <P>Yesterday was not the end of a process, but must be a beginning. It represents a licence for those who support democratic politics to take control. It places obligations on public representatives, particularly the First and Deputy First Ministers, who will take command of the devolved institutions soon. They should also take control in Ardoyne and confront those who think it is right to intimidate and terrify children going to school. They should take on those who take it upon themselves to define Northern Ireland's so-called no-go areas. With the new Police Service of Northern Ireland, they must confront those who believe acceptable policing is that delivered with a baseball bat. They must confront the growing sectarianism within society itself in Northern Ireland, which is possibly more prevalent now than when the troubles were at their height.</P>
    <P>We need more courage, not less of it &ndash; courage to look beyond basic instincts and tackle the bigger picture, to look beyond the needs of one's community and accept the concerns of the other, and to see our collective history as a complex process with wrongs on all sides. We need the courage to say that there is more to life than being mere orange or green, British or Irish. Only then, will Ireland become a fit place for all the Irish people to live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in acknowledging the importance of yesterday. As someone who was born and bred within sight of the Border, I am lucky to look out from where I live on the beautiful Mourne mountains in Northern Ireland every day. Every<Col N="1529" /> thing I have done in my political life has been to address the difficulties happening on the island because I firmly believed that the economic and social well-being of my own area would not prosper until there was stability on it.</P>
      <P>I echo Deputy Quinn's sentiments on the efforts of John Hume and, particularly Seamus Mallon, who through good times and bad articulated the views of Ireland's silent majority, especially in the North.</P>
      <P>When I heard of yesterday's announcement and the choreographed manner in which was done, I was reminded of other events. I remembered in the early summer of 1988 Martin Mansergh, Richie Healy from Meath and myself holding several meetings with Gerry Adams, Pat Doherty and Mitchel McLoughlin. This was the first contact, official or unofficial, between Sinn Féin and any political party in the South. My abiding memory, as I said before, was that while Gerry Adams and his colleagues were well meaning, they did not have the wherewithal to convince those who pulled the trigger and exploded the bomb that the constitutional, political path was the proper way to go. We articulated to them at the time that only by taking the constitutional and political path would they attempt to achieve the aim which the vast majority on this island had, that of unity of our island. I remember those times and that it has taken nearly 13 years for the IRA to listen not only to the encouragement of people such as Gerry Adams, Mitchell McLoughlin, Martin McGuinness and others, but also the urgings of all the political parties and political leaders we have been lucky enough to have had south of the Border. I echo the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach this morning when he said there was consensus in the Fianna Fáil Party. There were difficult times. I can remember when in Opposition there were times when we were unhappy with the direction being taken by the then Government, but thankfully there has been a consensus that has helped to solidify the path now reached.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's announcement reminded me of the inception of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, of which I was honoured to be chairman for some time along with Peter Temple-Morris, MP. That body did not get a great deal of recognition, but it changed the attitudes of Members and Senators here and Members of the United Kingdom Parliament regarding the problems on the island. With its deliberations we were able to articulate our views and accept the views of the other side. It was one of the other aspects that might not have been highlighted that played a helpful part in the process reached today and, I hope, into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement also reminded me of the ceasefires in 1994. I happened to be in the United Kingdom at a British-Irish conference when the first IRA ceasefire was announced. I remember being struck by the churlish attitude of the Unionists represented at the conference about the announcement. They quickly said they would <Col N="1530" /> not sit down with anyone until every bomb and bullet had been handed up. I have grown to understand the fears and doubts which members of the Unionist community have had in the intervening period. I can understand, particularly in recent times, how most people south of the Border could not understand the reason people could not have come on the constitutional path as there was no place in Irish society for having the ballot box in the one hand and the armalite in the other. What copperfastened all the moves made in the past has been the democratic vote flowing from the Good Friday Agreement. Nobody in the IRA or who had aspirations to force people into a united Ireland could deny the democratic vote of the Irish people validly given. That was one of the great achievements of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>From my party's perspective, we have been extremely lucky in the Taoisigh we have had. I note that Deputy Albert Reynolds is present and acknowledge the work he carried out. I also acknowledge the work done by former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. The process, of which I was part in 1988, was commenced by him, but perhaps not given enough recognition. The talks in 1988 tried to mirror what John Hume was doing with Gerry Adams at the time.</P>
    <P>Everyone will accept that the work of the Taoiseach has been incredible given the difficulties he experienced in finalising the Good Friday Agreement with the death of his mother. He subsequently left no stone unturned. His commitment through difficult times never ceases to amaze me.</P>
    <P>We have to acknowledge the work of Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others because there may have been times when they felt they should throw their hat at it. We also acknowledge the final piece in the jig-saw which happened with the involvement of President Clinton and George Mitchell, to whom we will always be extremely thankful.</P>
    <P>It is only in recent years that we have seen the benefits of good stable government in the North. I have been lucky to be part of a Cabinet which recently approved the sum of £10 million towards the cost of bringing a pipeline from Dundalk across the Border to service Border areas that historically have suffered because of Unionist domination in government. The pipeline will travel north of the Border to Belfast and on to Derry and service the north west and other counties along the western seaboard. The Government, on behalf of the Irish people, has dedicated the sum of £10 million towards the building of that pipeline, much of which will be in the North.</P>
    <P>As a result of the promptings of the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Seamus Mallon, Newry Mourne District Council and Dundalk Urban District Council, there is a commitment by the Northern Executive and the Northern authorities to upgrade the Dublin-Belfast motorway, north of the Border, a major source of complaint not only south of the Border, but also in Border areas <Col N="1531" /> which, historically, did not have good infrastructure mainly because they were of a Nationalist persuasion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the British Government through Secretary of State Reid today of the demolition of the army watch towers along the north Louth-south Armagh border. It has always been a source of much complaint by those of us in politics that to a certain extent there were people who claimed a monopoly of the wish that these should be removed. I hope the British Government will deliver on its promise.</P>
    <P>I have already said to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in talking about the watch towers along the Border, that there is a gun boat in the middle of Carlingford Lough for the past 25 to 30 years, of which Deputy McGahon will be aware.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It did in a way. However, it has been there for a number of years and would be much easier to remove than the watch towers. I would like to think it will be removed very quickly because, as Deputy McGahon will be aware, it has not helped tourism in the north Louth area, a most beautiful part of the country which includes the Mourne and Cooley Mountains. Perhaps the British Government will see its way to removing it forthwith.</P>
      <P>While this is a good day, we should not run away with ourselves. There is a great deal more work to be done. One has only to look at what is happening on the streets of Belfast. It will take many decades to do away with the mistrust, but at least yesterday's announcement in the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement shows that politics does work. Even though the profession of politics is criticised by the general public, for once we have shown the way and it is now up to the public to follow suit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of a process that has gone on for some years. It is a critical part of the process, but, as the Minister, Deputy Ahern, said, much work remains to be done. We have had false dawns before. This was, as Tony Blair once stated, a &ldquo;seismic shift&rdquo; on the part of the republican movement and the IRA. For too long, those of us in contact with people closely associated with the IRA were greeted with the phrase &ldquo;Not an inch, not a bullet&rdquo; and told that any surrender or decommissioning of weapons would be an insult to the people, such as IRA volunteers, who had died in the past. In that context, what hap<Col N="1532" /> pened yesterday represents a major and welcome change of policy on the part of the IRA. I hope it will continue along this positive route and help everyone in this country to build a better future.</P>
      <P>The most profound statements yesterday emanated from the leaders of both sides. The leader</P>
      <P>of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, summed matters up when he stated, &ldquo;This is the day we were told would never happen. This is the day we were told we would never see.&rdquo; I accept that he borrowed a quotation from Winston Churchill, but his words reflected everyone's feelings. Even the greatest optimists thought they would never see the day when the IRA would decommission weapons. People worked towards decommissioning and hoped that when the institutions were up and running it would not become an issue. However, credit must go to David Trimble for making it one and now, because of his persistence and that of many of the others involved, it has been taken out of the equation as far as the IRA is concerned. The sooner loyalist paramilitaries react to what has happened the better. They have always stated that their violence is reactive in nature. Now that the IRA has taken a giant leap forward, we expect an appropriate response from them in the near future.</P>
      <P>It is also worth quoting the statement of Gerry Adams who said yesterday, &ldquo;This is a huge moment in the history of our island, in the relationships between our island and the island of Britain, in the history of physical force republicanism. Let's not fritter it away or reduce it.&rdquo; I completely agree with him. A certain amount of momentum will be generated on foot of yesterday's events and it is important that we capitalise on it by ensuring the institutions get up an running in a serious manner in the immediate future and that their work is not obstructed in any way.</P>
      <P>There is also a bigger picture to consider. Communities north and south of the Border, organisations, chambers of commerce and local authorities must play their part by intensifying their contacts with each other. I am involved, with the community I represent, in a North-South project with others in Downpatrick which has proven beneficial in breaking down barriers. There are Unionists and Nationalists involved with the committee in Downpatrick who have visited Listowel on a number of occasions and I am going to visit their town next Wednesday. It would be great if this small project, which means so much to the people and areas involved, could be replicated 100 times, because it enhances friendships, breaks down barriers, removes suspicions, etc. I hope there will be an acceleration in contacts between people on both sides of the Border and that those involved in North-South initiatives, no matter how small, will redouble their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of reasons we have reached this point. The encouragement given by the Taoiseach, Deputy Noonan and other leaders was extremely important. However, recent events in America, in particular, changed the mindsets <Col N="1533" /> of republicans and the fact that they would be excluded from that country in the future no doubt helped. I hope next week Sinn Féin will announce its support for the new police force in Northern Ireland. That should be its next major move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having tabled a motion under Standing Order 31 this morning in order to bring about this debate, I am glad the main Opposition party has granted me five minutes in which to make a contribution for which I thank it.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I wholeheartedly welcome the statements from the IRA and General John de Chastelain, in particular, and pay tribute to those inside the republican movement, the broader Nationalist community and those in the Republic, the Unionist community and across the water who had the vision to see this day coming over a decade ago. They had the endurance to face often bitter opposition, particularly to their earliest attempts to put the process in place. It is to their credit that their endurance has paid off and brought us to this most important of days. This is a major step towards what will be a truly historic day in the story of these islands of the North Atlantic, as they are often called, when we will finally say that violence has been replaced by democratic politics.</P>
      <P>For most people in Ireland, this day has been too slow in coming. However, it would be wrong to forget the concerns of some who fear that this announcement may have come too soon. There are those in the Nationalist community who believe that the decision to decommission may place them in danger. It is absolutely essential that immediate progress be made on the policing issue in order that communities such as those in the Ardoyne can have full confidence in the new policing service's ability to protect them. I hope difficulties on the Unionist side need no longer impede progress on this most crucial of issues.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to ignore not only the remainder of Provisional IRA weaponry, but also the weapons of dissident republicans and loyalist paramilitaries and the military apparatus of the British Army. There is also the question of legally held arms. This issue is particularly important in the context of areas such as south Armagh where it is vital that military installations be removed quickly so as not to create a vacuum that could be filled by dissidents. It is the test of any state claiming democratic status that it relies solely upon its civil authorities to maintain law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We look forward to the full implementation of the Belfast Agreement which, in spite of its shortcomings, offers a real hope of the development of a true democratic political system in Northern Ireland and an honourable solution to centuries of conflict between Ireland and Britain. We ask that the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement also take hold in the South, whether this means tolerance of minority races, religions or languages. I hope the inclusivity of the Agreement will begin <Col N="1534" /> to be reflected in the Dáil in terms of giving a voice to smaller parties, even if it is in proportion to their size, in order that their members can make statements and contribute to debates of interest to all Members, not just those of the larger parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a short contribution to the debate. This is a day that many people have longed, prayed and worked for. It is an historic day. The republican movement made a bold and brave decision in taking this step forward. It is another historic milestone, of which there have been many. It is only correct that we should acknowledge the contribution of those &ndash; I will not name them because the list would be endless &ndash; who, in one way or another, contributed to the development of the peace process and recognise the various milestones we have passed along the way.</P>
      <P>When I was elected leader of Fianna Fáil in 1992, and before I became Taoiseach, I set out two political priorities: first, to bring peace to Ireland and, second, to grow the economy. I know people thought I was a bit mad because bringing peace to Ireland seemed a total impossibility. Members will recall that nobody saw that as a remote possibility. I looked at the results of successive Governments' policies over 30 years and tit for tat murders were still taking place: there was a terrible spate of them in the days before I took over. I felt it would be a failure of leadership not to attack this problem and to change Government policy if that policy needed to be changed.</P>
      <P>The way forward was pointed out by John Hume when he came to see me a couple of days after I became Taoiseach. He believed genuinely there was a window of opportunity for both Governments to take on the task, to accept the challenge of changing horizons in Northern Ireland and to work for peace in an effort to get rid of violence for all time. He believed that because of my well-known friendship with John Major and the trust between us that I was ideally placed to do this and I took on his message of hope, which he had delivered for 30 years. He, Seamus Mallon and the rest of the SDLP worked hard to deliver that message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So it was that the Downing Street Declaration, which we worked on behind the scenes for some time and put a fair balance into it, was the charter for peace in Ireland in that it recognised the mistakes and wrongdoing of the past on both sides and pointed the way forward. It offered a set of principles on which all could go forward. One of my abiding memories of that is that the loyalist paramilitaries, who were then under the combined loyalist command, wrote the five principles they wanted protected in any future agreement into paragraph 6 of the Downing Street Declaration. John Major and I did not change a word and they, for the first time, saw themselves as getting recognition. They did not believe mainstream <Col N="1535" /> unionism represented their views fully either and they felt left out in the cold. When paramilitaries are left out in the cold or in a vacuum we all know what happens.</P>
    <P>So it was that the Downing Street Declaration, which was a charter for peace, was followed by the framework document, which formed a large part of the agenda for the Good Friday Agreement. The Downing Street Declaration was probably the first milestone in this part of the process, while the second was the change in Government policy. We notified the President of that in the United States on 17 March 1993, six weeks after he was inaugurated. He wanted to join the process and did so because he wanted to fulfil a political commitment he had given to the Irish-Americans who had helped to elect him. As he said to me: </P>
    <P>This election is over but the next one starts now. If I can't hold the Reagan Democratic vote I can't win the Presidency again and consequently I'm going to live up to my promises.</P>
    <P>He asked me to take a peace envoy back with me but I said &lsquo;no'. I think he had George Mitchell in mind at the time but I did not think it would be successful, nor did I think it right to expect the unionists, who were in a local election period, to do anything about this.</P>
    <P>So it was that we changed Government policy and we took off the ban on members of Sinn Fein visiting the United States, which had been in place for 20 years. That was part of the first step to replace a strategy of violence with a strategy of non-violence and to demonstrate to those using violence, particularly on the republican side in the first instance, that there was another way forward that could be more productive in terms of results for their political objectives than the 30 years of violence which had killed more than 3,000 people and left 30,000 to 40,000 injured. What advance had there been in their objective? Nothing.</P>
    <P>Removing section 31 and the visa ban &ndash; though John Major and I were on different sides of the argument we left the decision to the Americans &ndash; showed the hard men that there could be progress through political means. A visa was given to Joe Cahill subsequently, just before the ceasefire came into play.</P>
    <P>The ceasefire was somewhat similar to the decision taken yesterday in that most people believed it would not happen or that if it happened it would not last very long. That was the view of unionism and loyalism but behind the scenes there was an indirect communications link to the republican movement and a direct link to the combined loyalist command. They gave me a commitment, if I got an IRA ceasefire, to call a ceasefire six weeks afterwards. They did so to the day, if not the hour. It showed that if one could understand where both sides were coming from, and their problems and objectives, one could start <Col N="1536" /> to do something about it. The ceasefires came into play, though people did not think they would, and despite the fact that people were saying the same then that they are now, I gladly took the risks to bring that about. I gladly put on the record of the House that as far as I was concerned, there and then the war was over in that the republican movement had taken a decision for the ceasefire to take place and I knew at the time what their views were. I had gone on the basis of Martin McGuinness saying: &ldquo;If section 74 of the Government of Ireland Act is on the table I'll be at that table.&rdquo; So it was in the end and I took him up on that.</P>
    <P>Other statements were made along the way which were changing the thinking in the republican movement. They had a big change of heart and direction at the time but of all the commitments they gave me in my time in office, I acknowledge that they never once broke their word. They were honourable about it, as were the loyalists. At this stage I hope the loyalists take the cue again to stop the violence that is going on, particularly the despicable treatment of young children trying to go to school. There is no basis for that. If yesterday's decision could influence thinking in that area maybe they will respond as they did in 1994, as they have the capacity to respond.</P>
    <P>Unionism has always been fearful that the IRA would not ever do what it has done and the same view obtained in 1994. I say to Unionists that they have got the issue that was burning within, and legitimately so; the two traditions had deep-rooted, genuine fears and a lack of confidence in the security forces to protect one from the other. It was as deep-rooted in one as the other. When people talked about the length of time decommissioning took, this is the sort of thinking that went on in both communities. One had to understand that. We all know that in a democracy there is no place for second armies but one had to understand the Northern Ireland situation when travelling the route to try to get peace and justice for both sides, which was my objective. The type of decommissioning being sought, a handing over of guns, symbolised defeat and would not ever have been a runner. A formula was found in the Good Friday Agreement, the next milestone, which emanated from long discussions &ndash; comhgairdeas to everyone involved &ndash; and which set out a fair deal on which everyone could go forward. Unionists had to see guns being taken out of the equation in order to contribute and I hope now they will. I do not doubt they will go forward from there. This will be seen as an historic movement and another chapter in Irish history, though I hope, a better chapter which will describe the progress we can make from here in understanding each other and understanding that we must all help each other. That is what people must do in the North. The problems and fears on both sides must be recognised. Yesterday's decision can do much to remove some of the fears. It can prepare the way to go forward and <Col N="1537" /> to achieve both sides' objectives. Let a future generation decide if changes are to be made to the constitutional position.</P>
    <P>I was privileged to have the opportunity to take the risk for peace, as were John Major and President Clinton. Different Governments of different hues here had to advance the situation, as did two different Administrations in both America and London. It has taken longer than I thought. I said at the time I believed the war was over. I am now convinced, not that I needed any more convincing, that the war is over, that the rest of the guns will be put where they should be, that is, out of use for all time, that the loyalist paramilitaries will follow suit and that there will be the positive approach that I expect from the Unionists.</P>
    <P>Above all, the greatest signal they can give is to stop the abuse of young children in North Belfast. It is the wrong message about Ireland to be sending out around the world. We want the message to be that there is a positive approach and a positive movement in the whole situation. That is what can bring more prosperity and a good strong economy to the North of Ireland which is just as good as our own.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that we had to improve our economy before people in the North would look seriously at co-operating. The North-South bodies are in place. When their economy expands, as no doubt it will when the gun is finally taken out of politics, they will get investment in trade and tourism, and we can all come together and create what the Irish, at home and abroad, have wanted for generations, that is, a peaceful Ireland going forward confidently as a full member of Europe and creating jobs for the people so that in future they will not have to travel abroad to earn their living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a hard line opponent of terrorism here over almost 20 years, I want to congratulate my friend, Deputy Albert Reynolds, for his contribution which has not been fully acknowledged, as yet, since this historic announcement. However, I do not share his conviction that everything in the garden is rosy.</P>
      <P>As somebody who has lived in Dundalk, less than two miles from the Border, I have known men who have been murdered by IRA and loyalist terrorists. It sticks in my craw that many of these killers &ndash; we must realise they are killers &ndash; have got off scot-free because of appeasement tactics by the British and Irish Governments over the years. Those tactics were not those of the man sitting beside me, Deputy John Bruton, who displayed tremendous foresight, knowledge and vision by refusing to accept the demands of the IRA. He did not trust them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have come to this decision because of world opinion. It is, to a degree, a cynical gesture on the part of this killer organisation because they want to get more seats here next year. The awful events which occurred in America on 11 September are the real reason they made this ges<Col N="1538" /> ture. That said, it is with a sense of relief that I heard this news. I hope that the awful shadow which has menaced my town and hung over it for 30 years will lift in time.</P>
    <P>I must express grave reservations at the suggestion that they will disarm totally. Frankly, I do not believe it. While American politicians obviously played a part, they too turned a blind eye over the years to fund raising in America to provide arms which killed Irish people, some of whom I knew.</P>
    <P>This must be the only country in the world where terrorism has been rewarded. We have had our own bin Ladens. We have had our own bin Laden, Mr. McGuinness, who was undoubtedly the chief of staff of the IRA. We have had a bin Laden, Mr. Adams, who was heavily involved. They were guilty by association in the deaths and mutilation of up to 4,000 people.</P>
    <P>The objective to which we all aspire in this is peace in our land and, hopefully, the unification of this country. I do not disagree with the aspiration of the IRA, but I do disagree with their methods which involve killing people. They have got away with it because the unification of this country is a sacred goal for most politicians in this House and we have turned a blind eye. Prime Minister Blair, the man who is going around the world as a hawk, seems to me, on occasions, to have schizophrenic views on terrorism. That said, I hope that my long-term views and concerns are wrong, but I must express deep cynicism at this particular movement by the IRA.</P>
    <P>I also want to suggest that the future threat to stability in the North and, indeed, here in the South will come from the loyalist paramilitaries who have seen what appeasement has got the IRA over the years. The Government in the North and the British Government should stamp down immediately on the loyalist paramilitaries. I want to endorse what Deputy Reynolds said about the disgraceful attitude of the Unionist people towards unfortunate kids who are simply seeking to go to school. That cannot be tolerated in any half civilised society.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September should have opened the eyes of many people here. These are fellow travellers who had ambivalent views on terrorism. Fundamentalist terrorism is the same the world over. There is no difference between an Arab fundamentalist and a green fundamentalist.</P>

      <P>I join previous speakers in welcoming last night's announcement by the IRA that they will put beyond use a quantity of arms. I hope they mean all of them and that it will be verified by General John de Chastelain.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I want to acknowledge the contribution of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. For a man who played such an important part in the developments down through the years, he was modest in his contribution to the debate today. It is important that we acknowledge the presence in the House of two former Taoisigh this evening &ndash; the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, who also played a very important part in the process, is also present &ndash; and that we acknowledge their roles in the process.</P>
      <P>People are describing the announcement last night as historic. I would not go so far as to call it historic but I would call it important. The Good Friday Agreement was historic. This is part of the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is not an <i>à la carte</i> agreement. It is a set agreement and we cannot pick and choose from it. This was an important integral part of that agreement, the decommissioning of arms held by the IRA and also by the loyalist paramilitaries. There is no place for guns or ammunition in a democracy.</P>
      <P>Nothing is more barbaric or cowardly than the deeds we have witnessed in recent days and weeks, where pipe bombs have been thrown into private homes while young families are asleep in their beds. The persons involved in those deeds do not have the backbone of a louse. The people engaged in that type of activity are small minded and mean. While I understand that young people are being provoked into this, their masters are sinister and evil and the same may be said of those involved in punishment beatings. Who has the right to take a young boy or a man out of his house and knee-cap him and beat him? There are laws to deal with that and I hope that all this activity will stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this activity of intimidating children going to school sent frightful pictures on the television screens across the world which make people ask what type of people are the Irish? We were all branded by that because people did not make a distinction between the North and South. The Ireland as they saw it is not the Ireland as we know it. There are marvellous people in Northern Ireland. I live within three miles of the Border and have good friends and neighbours in Fermanagh who are excellent, first class people who want to get on with their lives, as we do, but they were prevented from doing so by bullies on both sides. I hope we will see an end to that as there is now a major opportunity, including for North-South relations. There is finance available for cross-Border projects which previously were not getting off <Col N="1540" /> the ground. Recently I was at a conference in Enniskillen and I proposed that the ICA in Butler's Bridge, my own village, should have a meeting with the ICA in Enniskillen, but I was told that could not happen as the people would be fearful. It is wrong that they should be fearful and that must stop. People are willing to come together and work together, but they are fearful of what might happen, that their families might be intimidated or that something worse might happen.</P>
    <P>Recently I was in south Armagh and saw the British army helicopters flying low over farm lands, scattering cattle all over the countryside. This is done to intimidate and it must stop. I hope this development is the end of such activities and that we can look to a brighter future. I hope we can start to build on projects such as the Castle Saunderson boy scouts jamboree centre, where young people, North and South, can come together, develop their lives and understand each other. There is also a major opportunity in terms of tourism. We see the problems which have resulted from the attacks of 11 September and the collapse of the American tourism market. People North and South should cross the Border for holidays. People from Northern Ireland are very welcome in the South. The Erne catchment area is open to development.</P>
    <P>I have more to say, but do not have sufficient time. I welcome the major development and the further step which has been taken. We acknowledge it but do not call it historic.</P>

      <P>I welcome the statement by General de Chastelain and the IRA decommissioning which has taken place to date. We have waited a long time for movement on a number of issues arising from the Good Friday Agreement. Now that there has been movement on decommissioning by the IRA it is time to address some of the other issues which have been impeding full implementation of the Agreement. The loyalist paramilitaries should decommission. It is time the attacks on the school children in Ardoyne, emanating from a level of hatred, and in many other areas such as Portadown were stopped. It is time all forms of violence ended, not just violence involving weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for everyone, particularly those who represent their communities, including democratically elected representatives, to recognise that there were referenda in 1998, North and South, on the same day in which 71% of the people in the North and 96% of those in the South voted for the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. All those who are in a position to influence events should never forget this. The referendum was a directive to every<Col N="1541" /> body to implement the Good Friday Agreement and we want to see this done.</P>
    <P>I grew up in south Armagh and am very well aware of the concern and anxiety of all the people there at the level of militarisation seven years after the first ceasefire. Deputy Boylan referred to helicopters, but also involved are military personnel on the ground, look-out posts and a level of activity which is totally unacceptable. I understand that work has commenced today on removing some of these look-out towers and I hope it will not be long before we see the removal of all of them, not just in south Armagh but in other areas where they are of concern to people.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement has brought great benefits to the people of the island. Violence has practically been brought to an end, although unfortunately it still exists. In economic and social terms the Agreement has been of tremendous benefit. In Cavan-Monaghan, my constituency, there is a new air of confidence and a new recognition of the unprecedented level of opportunities for economic and social development. This is reflected in the level of activity and co-operation through, for example, the North-South bodies, local authorities, business organisations and people on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, the two Governments and all the parties involved in helping bring about the situation we have today. I appeal to everybody involved to address the few remaining issues and ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full. This has to be for the betterment of all people on the island, North and South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a short contribution. In recent years in the House we have had the opportunity to discuss developments in Northern Ireland. Fortunately, many of those debates took place following developments which were positive, such as the signing of the Downing Street Declaration in 1993, the announcement of the ceasefire in August 1994, the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the legislation establishing the North-South all-Ireland bodies in 1999. Unfortunately, there were other occasions when we had debates, such as in the aftermath of the Canary Wharf bombing and the Omagh atrocity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy Cowen, stated in opening the debate, yesterday's development was most important and significant. I compliment the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all others involved in leading the peace process to this stage. It is essential that every aspect of the Good Friday Agreement is implemented. Politicians, North and South, were mandated by the overwhelming majority of the electorate through the referendums in May 1998 to implement the Agreement. It offered Irish people a new beginning and decommissioning underpins this new start. It creates the conditions for a new trust and confidence between the two traditions <Col N="1542" /> on the island. No group or political party can be allowed exercise a veto on the implementation of that Agreement, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Irish people, North and South. The political advances which can now be achieved will benefit everybody on the island.</P>
    <P>As other speakers mentioned, we were all appalled by the scenes in north Belfast, particularly in Ardoyne. The mindset of those loyalists involved in violence must be changed. Paramilitary groups must decommission and all weapons must be put beyond use. The political process must be seen to protect and enhance the everyday lives of those people living in communities which continue to suffer through violence. Fortunately, we are the first generation in hundreds of years to have achieved a peace settlement embracing all the main traditions in Ireland. The Northern Executive is made up of Ministers from across the political process, which is a huge leap forward. Recently the Taoiseach stated that a new and widely acceptable police service will be established in line with the Patten Report, which deserves full Nationalist support. I commend the SDLP on courageously leading the way. I pay tribute to Deputy Albert Reynolds for advancing the peace process. He rightly paid tribute to Seamus Mallon and John Hume on their endeavours over the years through the good and bad times and their efforts to bring normal politics to the northern part of our country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, stated very significantly: &ldquo;Against the constitutional background set out in the Agreement, we need to overcome the fact that the political Border on the island has been economically disruptive, socially and culturally divisive, to the hindrance and detriment of all for far too long.&rdquo; Everybody in the House, including the two former Taoisigh, know that the economy of the southern Border counties was devastated through the political difficulties in the North for over 30 years. Some 12 counties were directly affected as a result of the political troubles. All of us who are honoured to represent Border constituencies are particularly conscious of the need to attract further investment to that area. There is a need to underpin the political process and the peace process by giving people the economic dividend they need and which did not exist for 30 to 35 years. I support the remarks of my constituency colleagues who said that we need flagship projects to be identified and funded. Those of us who represent the Border area would have no difficulty in identifying such projects.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government and to the various Departments to think positively about giving the infrastructure and investment needed. Investment in the southern Border counties will have a positive knock-on effect on the economy north of the Border. We have suffered tremendously over the years because of the haemorrhage of people through emigration and the lack of job opportunities. We all know it is not an inclusive society when people are idle and have no workplace to <Col N="1543" /> go to. In modern Ireland we need to provide job opportunities for all the people and we need extra investment in the northern part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Crawford. I congratulate all those who have contributed throughout the years to achieving what Senator Ted Kennedy described as a new day of liberation for all the people of Northern Ireland. I include in my congratulations the two former Taoisigh who are present in the House. I know the words of praise for the SDLP will be appreciated by the party. I join with Deputy Noonan in acknowledging the courage, tenacity and skill of the republican movement. I listened to the Minister, Deputy Ahern, tell us about a meeting he and others had with the republican movement a number of years ago. He reminded me of meetings I had as a member of the SDLP in 1988 when John Hume, Seamus Mallon, Seán Farren and myself were on one side and Gerry Adams, Mr. Morrison and two or three others were on the other side. I am pleased that what we were encouraging then has now come about.</P>
      <P>Decommissioning, even when completed, is not an end in itself. The ultimate objective has to be reconciliation between the two major traditions in Northern Ireland and on this island. The creation of the new institutions in the North and the link between North and South are useful only to the extent that they contribute to that reconciliation. The powersharing Executive, in particular, provides the workplace where representatives of the two traditions can join together in government to tackle the political, social, economic and cultural problems which afflict the northern community and who can, watching the 17th century rerun in Ardoyne in recent weeks, minimise the enormity of the job that has to be done in eradicating sectarianism and the political, social, economic and cultural problems which underlie it. The start of this process of putting illegal weaponry beyond use and, I hope, its quick completion provides the opportunity and spur to get down to the job of tackling these age old problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There remains one outstanding problem, policing. The new agreed institutions will not work properly and the efforts of the responsibility sharing Executive will not be successful unless there is a policing service with which all can identify and those suitable can join. Not only that, the evidence of the past suggests that the lack of an acceptable police service will lead over time to the erosion of the institutions. Ideally, policing should be under the control of the Executive which I believe will happen eventually. An administration which cannot enforce its own laws is a eunuch. In the meantime, I hope the republican movement will join with the SDLP in participating on the police board and advising young Nationalists and republicans to join. There is no logical reason the republican movement should not take this step. The British Government will <Col N="1544" /> bend over backwards to accommodate them. Republicans have now consented to the existence of the Northern Ireland state. They are participating in its government and its other institutions. Helping to run its police service does not, therefore, raise any question of principle or fundamental policy.</P>
    <P>On this day of generosity and congratulations there are people we should not forget. Let us remember those who lost their lives and their relatives who still suffer daily. Let us remember those who have been banished from Northern Ireland by the diktat of paramilitiaries and who, I hope, will now be allowed to return without delay. Let us remember the disappeared whose relatives still do not have a focal point for their mourning. They and their relatives still cry out for justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Currie for sharing his time with me on this very important subject.</P>
      <P>Deputies Smith and O'Hanlon mentioned that those of us who live in the Border area understand the situation better. I wish to take this opportunity to encourage the Government to ensure that funds and other necessary measures are put in place in the region. While much has happened since the Good Friday Agreement regarding industry coming to this country, both North and South, it has not ended up in the Border region which has suffered most in the past. I support Deputies Smith's and O'Hanlon's request to ensure flagship projects are placed in that region. To date no major cross-Border body has been set up in the Monaghan region even though we have the longest and most difficult Border region. That situation must be rectified. The food industry was set up in Cork.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the two former Taoisigh present in the House, Deputies Albert Reynolds and John Bruton, both of whom gave sterling service. Deputy Bruton brought in George Mitchell who tried to bring about decommissioning, which some felt was not a major issue but as part of the Agreement had to be dealt with. Both men played a major role and I acknowledge their presence in the House tonight.</P>
      <P>As someone who has lived all my life within a few miles of the Border with Northern Ireland, I have all the more reason to rejoice and thank God that we have reached 24 October and IRA decommissioning. This opens up the possibility to move forward in a positive manner through the Northern Ireland Assembly, cross-Border bodies and all the other democratic institutions. I stood at the graveside of people from both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland and along the Border and there was no difference in their tears. Anyone involved with the funerals following the Omagh atrocity will never forget the cost of terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate all Taoisigh and political leaders, including Garrett FitzGerald, on their efforts to build trust and a good relationship with and <Col N="1545" /> within Northern Ireland. The present Taoiseach, his Ministers, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and his predecessors have worked hard and patiently to hold things together to reach this stage. I pay tribute to all political parties in Northern Ireland who stood with the Good Friday Agreement. Decommissioning opens up a new era for John Hume, David Trimble and Gerry Adams and must lead to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. My closest contacts since my election to this House were Ken Maginnis, MP, Fermanagh-South Tyrone and Seamus Mallon, MP, from the Armagh border. Their commitment was total. Given where they come from they understand the problems. As someone who called for decommissioning at every possible opportunity since it was part of the Agreement, I now call on the loyalist groups and other splinter groups to follow the IRA especially as loyalists claimed they only held arms to defend themselves. I want to be associated with the words of others here tonight about the disgraceful events in Belfast especially which have been broadcast on international television. The knee-capping and all the other issues that go with so-called policing within that organisation must end.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the decision to decommission was influenced by what happened in the USA on 11 September. We must not allow the impetus to cease. The IRA must continue the process. We must have one police force in Northern Ireland which has the support of all the people.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the SDLP on the lead it took and the fact that it was the first party to support the peace process. I hope that all others will join it and make sure that this police force works properly for everybody. All other aspects of the Good Friday Agreement must be implemented. The fact that Agriculture Ministers from both sides of the Border were able to work together during the foot and mouth disease crisis proved the value of those sort of processes.</P>
    <P>As regards tourism, the Border region especially will benefit from this new situation. Like my colleagues, I want true cross-Border projects such as the Ulster Canal and Castle Saunderson's Scout Centre brought into being as quickly as possible. There is much goodwill and opportunity and we must make sure that the impetus that exists is continued.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all those concerned with this project. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is in the Chamber, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, played their role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to make a short statement on the historic events of yesterday. The statement by the IRA that they had implemented the scheme previously agreed with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and the subsequent report by the commission confirming that a quantity of arms, including firearms, ammunition and <Col N="1546" /> explosives, had been decommissioned are events of enormous significance which give new life to the peace process. I do not underestimate the difficulties faced by the IRA in coming to its decision. It is, from its perspective, an unprecedented move.</P>
      <P>Decommissioning has always been an essential element in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, an Agreement democratically endorsed North and South. The start of the process of actual decommissioning by the IRA enables that Agreement to now move forward in all areas. It gives people on this island the genuine hope that the commitment exists to give reality to the promise held out by the Agreement.</P>
      <P>Both Governments have worked very hard to see this day. I want to especially mention the contribution made by the Taoiseach, who has never flagged in his commitment to the cause of peace. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has also given generously of his time and effort in this process. Like Deputy Crawford, I would like to acknowledge the presence in the House of the two former Taoisigh who made a very significant contribution to the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are so many others who have made contributions, too many to mention here today, but I must pay a special tribute to the work of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. General de Chastelain and his colleagues have played a crucial role in developments through their independent oversight and verification of the process of decommissioning. The international arms inspectors, former President Ahtisaari and Mr. Ramaphosa, contributed enormously to the process. In response to its announcement that its task has come to an end with the engagement by the IRA with the International Commission on Decommissioning, we were fortunate that at a difficult time in that process, persons of the integrity and international standing of former President Ahtisaari and Mr. Ramaphosa were prepared to contribute so much to the resolution of the arms issue through the confidence building measures they helped to put in place. It is a tribute to their commitment to the cause of peace that they gave so much of their time and effort.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge also the role played by Sinn Féin in making the case to the IRA for decommissioning. They all played their part but it finally took a decision by the IRA which, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I warmly welcome. It is a decision which called for a response designed to reinforce the momentum it has given to the peace process. In this context the two Governments will not be found wanting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been those who, perhaps for understandable reasons, doubted whether actual decommissioning would ever occur, suspected that the prospect of decommissioning held out by the IRA and other groups was a tactical ploy and <Col N="1547" /> wondered if politics would ever win out over violence. The decision by the IRA has answered those doubts and has opened the way to the resolution of outstanding issues. Politics is said to be the art of the possible. Perhaps the events of yesterday show that it may also be the art of what many people thought to be impossible.</P>
    <P>There have been statements by a number of commentators to the effect that the actual events following decommissioning will be even more important than the act of decommissioning. It is of fundamental importance now that there is movement across a whole range of issues and that we see the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. There are no circumstances which one can envisage whereby both Governments will be found wanting in this respect.</P>
    <P>It is of crucial importance that there is progress on the issue of policing. Policing is fundamental to the whole question of law and order, its enforcement and its respect in any society. In that respect I sincerely hope that we will see the implementation of the Patten report. I hope that outstanding difficulties, in so far as they exist, can be resolved and that accommodation and compromise can be reached where it seems there are logjams which would block that process.</P>
    <P>We must make no mistake. The logjam which the failure to decommission to date represented was a serious one. It has been unlocked in a fashion which demands a generous response and insists that magnanimity should also play its part now.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the island of Ireland is on the threshold of a brand new beginning at the cusp of a new millennium, a beginning which many people worked over many generations to achieve. We owe it not just to former generations but to subsequent generations that every political party and individual will work to ensure that the Agreement works. I feel sure that will be the result of the decision by the IRA to decommission its arms and under no circumstances should the historical significance of this be underestimated. Militant republicanism has never decommissioned its arms by putting them verifiably beyond use. This is the first time that has occurred on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that no individual or group has the right to subvert the democratic will of the people of Ireland, North and South. They have expressed their wish that the Good Friday Agreement be operated and that it be done so in a democratic fashion. The word must go out from this House and from other democratic fora that any attempt to subvert the Agreement or the will of the people of this island will not and cannot be tolerated.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that we have this special debate on Northern Ireland and it is particularly appropriate that two former Taoisigh are in the Chamber. Both of them have played an enormous part, along with Deputy Dick Spring, <Col N="1548" /> in creating a change in Northern Ireland that is to their great credit.</P>
      <P>The decommissioning of IRA weapons is the breakthrough that was desperately needed to ensure the future of the Good Friday Agreement. It is an initiative that was long in coming. Now that it has been confirmed by the International Commission on Decommissioning, its significance is fundamental not just for politics in Northern Ireland but for every one of us. Today we find ourselves living, literally, on an altered island. Possibilities are opening up and the prospect of a fair and secure future is brought closer. In setting about the abandonment of its weapons, the Provisional IRA has taken a step across the Rubicon and taken its place in the history books. Lasting credit is due to all those who made this possible.</P>
      <P>For many of us it seemed that this day would never come. It has taken the truly horrific acts of</P>
      <P>terrorism of 11 September to force the pace and to create the imperative which the Provisional IRA has moved to obey and which the rest of us accept as the cornerstone of democracy. Democracy demands absolute allegiance to the mandate given freely by the people. Terror, murder, intimidation and punishment beatings have no part in the process. One cannot be half a democrat and operate on a paramilitary basis simultaneously. The republican movement has made a choice which, inexorably, must lead to the end of any paramilitary parallel organisation. It may not happen quickly but happen it must. This move may not mark the end of physical force republicanism but I hope it marks the beginning of the end.</P>
      <P>I hope the statement by the IRA yesterday represents a sea change in republican thinking, but I suspect that is not yet the case. I fear the decision was made for tactical reasons rather than through any conviction that violence is wrong. It would be good to hear that the IRA spokesman, P. O'Neill, is saying clearly and unequivocally that the war is over, but I acknowledge that Gerry Adams has come close to saying so over the past few days. However, even if the decision to decommission was taken purely for tactical reasons, it is still welcome and it is still significant. Every step that brings the republican movement further into the democratic system makes it more difficult to revert to violence. The initiative taken by the IRA forces responsibility onto the loyalist gangs that are still armed and active in Northern Ireland. Loyalists have often argued that their paramilitary organisations grew up as a response to IRA terror, yet the record speaks for itself. Brutal sectarian attacks have characterised and continue to characterise loyalist violence. It is vital now that the same response is extracted from loyalism as has been extracted from the republican movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that has been said about this being a historic and unprecedented development is true. Many people thought we would never see the day when the republican movement would voluntarily <Col N="1549" /> put guns, ammunition and explosives beyond use. Of course, this is not the only unprecedented development. It was unprecedented for members of Sinn Féin, a party inextricably linked to an organisation that was responsible for horrific crimes over the past 30 years, to be received as honoured guests in Government Buildings, Downing Street and the White House. It was unprecedented for Sinn Féin to be guaranteed ministerial positions in the devolved Government in Northern Ireland. It was unprecedented for the Ulster Unionist Party to agree to share power with Sinn Féin, even while it retained its link with the IRA and while the IRA retained its huge arsenal.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Good Friday Agreement was to break free from the stranglehold of the past and to create a new dispensation in Northern Ireland and between the two islands. The Agreement set an ambitious agenda. With all the problems, interruptions and false starts, it is easy to lose sight of the achievements, which are considerable. A new devolved Government, including members of the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin, has been established. This is a remarkable achievement and one that has been very popular among people in Northern Ireland who, for so long, were starved of any kind of governmental structure that reflected their views at local level. The British army was taken off the streets, Border roads were re-opened, army barracks dismantled and the gates of prisons were thrown open, and this was often at the cost of great pain for the families of the victims of violence. A totally new approach to policing was developed, from which we in the Republic could learn much. I commend the SDLP for showing leadership and courage in its approach to policing in Northern Ireland. Cross-Border bodies were established, new human rights bodies were set up and Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution were amended, with the overwhelming support of the people.</P>
    <P>By far the greatest achievement of the Good Friday Agreement is that it led to a huge reduction in the level of political violence in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been experiencing its lowest levels of political violence for more than 30 years. The blunt reality is that there are people alive today who would, in all probability, be dead were it not for the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>There have been various attempts by senior republicans to rewrite history but we must ensure that truth is not another casualty in the bloody conflict of Northern Ireland. The duplicitous ending of the IRA ceasefire in 1996 has been written out of history and, on many occasions, I have heard Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness claim that the IRA guns have been silent since 1994. The record must stand and another myth to be challenged is the claim that IRA arms were required to protect the Nationalist population. The IRA murdered almost 600 members of the Nationalist population over the past 30 years. The biggest category of IRA victims were members of <Col N="1550" /> the Nationalist population. Far from providing any degree of protection, IRA arms and explosives were one of the biggest threats to Nationalists.</P>
    <P>We have to acknowledge all who died, whether Nationalists or Unionists, or members of the British army. We must understand the past and we must use that understanding to build a future free of fear and hatred. The sectarianism of Northern Ireland cannot be underestimated. It runs very deep and extends over centuries. The evidence at Holy Cross school shows the extent of the problem of sectarianism and that evil persists, but also that much work still remains to be done. We have also discovered in the Republic, particularly in the new multi-cultural Ireland, what we have suddenly become, that here also there is prejudice, hatred and fear which we have to tackle. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation considered, in a sub-committee, the obstacles to reconciliation as between the Republic and Northern Ireland. It is time to publish that report and to consider the challenges it presents to us in the Republic. Prejudice does not begin at the Border and we, too, have to make an effort at reconciliation. We, in the Republic, have our part to play in bringing about the necessary decommissioning of mindsets as well as decommissioning of weapons, which peace and democracy require.</P>

      <P>I commend the leadership and volunteers of the Irish Republican Army for the momentous step they have taken. It was an unprecedented development and a very difficult decision that required real courage. In its statement the IRA said it had taken the step to save the peace process and to persuade others of their genuine intentions. I have no doubt about the genuineness of the republicans who have taken this decision. I firmly believe they are sincere in their pursuit of justice and lasting peace in our country. The IRA has demonstrated that commitment at every stage of the peace process from the August 1994 cessation onwards. That fact needs to be recognised by all sides in this House. What also needs to be recognised is the huge difficulty a development such as this causes for very many sincere republicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Long before yesterday's events, we in Sinn Féin had fulfilled our obligations with regard to decommissioning and to every other aspect of the Good Friday Agreement. Nonetheless, repeated efforts were made to deny the rights of our electorate and to exclude us from the institutions established under the Agreement. The Taoiseach acknowledged in this House a fortnight ago that David Trimble's exclusion of Sinn Féin Minister for Education, Martin McGuinness, and Minister for Health, Bairbre de Brún, from the All-Ireland Ministerial Council was in breach of the Agreement and was found in the courts to be unlawful.</P>
    <P>The IRA was not a party to the Good Friday Agreement. It helped to create the conditions, which brought about the Agreement. It helped to sustain it and now the IRA has taken a course of action which should, if others fulfil their obligations, save the agreement and the peace process.</P>
    <P>I refute utterly the notion that these developments have come about as a result of 11 September or the arrest of three Irishmen in Colombia. Long before 11 September, the IRA had taken other unprecedented initiatives including its engagement with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and its agreement that two international inspectors, Cyril Ramaphosa and Martti Ahtisaari, should have access to a number of arms dumps. Anyone even remotely familiar with Irish history knows that these were also unprecedented and very difficult initiatives for a militant republican organisation to take.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the background against which yesterday's decision was taken. It followed a summer in which we have seen an escalating loyalist sectarian campaign against Catholics with murders, nightly pipe bomb attacks and the daily terrorisation of the pupils and parents of Holy Cross in Ardoyne. It came after a summer when no progress was made on British demilitarisation and a summer when the institutions were in limbo as a result of the refusal of the Unionist Party to share power with republicans. This is the real background to the courageous republican decision of 23 October 2001.</P>
    <P>We now have a new opportunity to fulfil the promise of the Good Friday Agreement. We need to see long overdue progress on all fronts. Moves on demilitarisation announced today by British Secretary of State, John Reid, must be part of an ongoing process. We must see all British military installations removed so that the people of south Armagh and all other parts of the Six Counties can live in peace on their land. The British Army never had any right in Ireland and it must be removed, bag and baggage, once and for all.</P>
    <P>The current policing legislation falls far short of Patten which was itself a compromise. There must be real accountability, the disbandment of the Special Branch &ndash; a force within a force &ndash; and the human rights oath for all members and new recruits. Plastic bullets must be banned. We <Col N="1552" /> need to see the repeal of repressive British legislation. We need real action to combat economic discrimination against nationalists, and to regenerate all deprived communities, Unionist and Nationalist alike.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government must fulfil its obligations and commitments. We need to see the repeal of repressive legislation in this jurisdiction &ndash; the odious Offences Against the State Act, which is an affront to civil rights. There must be progress on representation in the Oireachtas for citizens in the Six Counties, a measure which has been delayed for far too long. The delay has not been since Good Friday 1998 but, as the record of this House will show, since at least 1951 when a motion seeking right of audience for Six County MPs was tabled by Sean MacBride but rejected by the de Valera Government.</P>
    <P>We need to see a real peace dividend for the Border counties. That has been promised, but there has been little sign of it in the communities in Counties Cavan and Monaghan, which I represent.</P>
    <P>I urge the leaders of unionism to embrace this new opportunity for progress. They should renew their commitment to the Good Friday Agreement. They should now participate fully in all the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement, including the All-Ireland Ministerial Council and the All-Ireland bodies. It is in all our interests for the leaders of unionism to defend and promote the agreement among their own supporters and beyond, harnessing the broad support for it in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Unionist leaders need to give real leadership to those loyalist communities where sectarianism is flourishing, stoked by anti-agreement politicians and loyalist paramilitaries &ndash; Glenbryn Estate for example where protesters are daily terrorising young Catholic schoolgirls. Mr Trimble could and should stand side by side with the parents and their children. He and others need to actively combat the sectarianism, which blames the social and economic problems of loyalist communities on their Nationalist neighbours. All of us need to encourage the emergence of real leadership from loyalist working-class communities, which have been the political cannon fodder of bigots for decades.</P>
    <P>Contrary to much of the commentary around these developments, it is important to point out that the Irish republican tradition is not and never has been static and unchanging. It has always developed and adapted to the times and the political conditions, but the commitment to Irish unity and independence and to social justice for all our people has not changed and will not change. The republican tradition, which I am proud to represent, did not end in 1921 and draws no distinction between the Mountjoy Ten and the Long Kesh Ten.</P>
    <P>This is a time of renewed hope. I look forward to working with those of every tradition on this island as we create a new Ireland in which all our children can live together as equals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Politics is often downgraded and people make little of our profession. However, when we look at what has happened in the past 24 hours, we can say this is a great achievement of democratic politics in our time. I hope those who are cynical about politicians and unwilling perhaps even to vote because of that cynicism, recognise that democratically elected non-violent politicians working patiently to change people's minds have brought us to this important day.</P>
      <P>Arms have no place in Irish politics and I am glad at last the republican movement has recognised that. Violence never made any useful contribution to Irish political development in the past 200 years. I am a constitutional nationalist right back to pre-1916. If constitutional nationalism had been followed there would have been no Civil War nor would there have been the sort of Stormont administration in a partitioned Ireland that the people of Northern Ireland had to endure for so long. The constitutional path would have led us to a better Ireland sooner. That is a matter of historical speculation on which many will disagree.</P>
      <P>I am glad to speak in the House, not only in the presence of Deputy Albert Reynolds, whose role I join others in praising, but also in the presence of the person who led the first civil rights march in Ireland, Deputy Austin Currie. It is important to recognise that it was not the others who came to more prominent positions in that movement who led the first march, but Deputy Austin Currie. He was protesting against discrimination in housing which would never have been possible if Stormont had not been established by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, something which would not have happened if home rule had been allowed to come into force.</P>
      <P>I also acknowledge the many victims of violence. I have been in this House throughout the duration of the Troubles. I shared a small office with a Deputy from a neighbouring constituency, Billy Fox, when I first came here aged 22. Billy Fox was murdered by the IRA on 11 March 1974, a day I will never forget. That gives me some insight into the feelings of the Catholics and Protestants who have lost relatives and loved ones to the violence of loyalists and the IRA. It gives me some insight also into the feelings of the widow of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.</P>
      <P>At this time of celebration we must not forget the unhealed hurt of many families. We must also remember that for the Good Friday Agreement to work there must be the consent and support of Unionists and Nationalists. The Sunningdale Agreement failed because in the general election of 1974, anti-agreement Unionists got 51% of the vote while pro-agreement unionists got only 13%, thereby creating the political conditions for the Ulster workers' strike. It is essential that Unionist support be maintained and that everything said or done on the Nationalist side takes account not only of their needs but also the need to maintain Unionist support for the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current phase in the process is due to the <Col N="1554" /> negotiation of the Downing Street Declaration by my then predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and former Prime Minister, John Major. However, it is fair to say that the declaration would not have been possible were it not for the prior negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. That agreement created the type of close relationship between Taoisigh and British Prime Ministers and between British and Irish administrators that created the conditions of trust enabling Deputy Albert Reynolds and John Major to negotiate the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant aspects of the Downing Street Declaration was the fact that unlike the Anglo-Irish Agreement, it was accepted by Unionists. That was due to a number of factors, one of which was that the British Government consulted Unionists whereas they were not consulted on the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It was also due to efforts I made. One month before the Downing Street Declaration was negotiated I led the first ever delegation from a party south of the Border since the Anglo-Irish Agreement to meet members of the Ulster Unionist Party at their headquarters in Glengall Street. That reaching out from this side of the Border to the Unionist community was a small contribution towards creating the conditions in which it was possible for Deputy Albert Reynolds and John Major to secure Unionist support for the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>It is frequently suggested by republican spokespersons that the issue of decommissioning was first raised with them by the British after the IRA ceasefire of August 1994, that it was a condition imposed after the event to create difficulties for republicans. That is not true and my authority on this could not be better. It was Gerry Adams, who, on 8 January 1994 told the <i>Irish News</i> that the discussions Sinn Féin had been having with the British Government had concerned &ldquo;how the IRA can hand over their weapons.&rdquo; That was eight months before the ceasefire. To say, therefore, that the issue of weapons had not been raised with Sinn Féin prior to the ceasefire is untrue.</P>
    <P>I have regrets about the way the ceasefire was put in place without clarifying between the intermediaries involved what exactly were the conditions regarding entry to talks and decommissioning and what linkage, if any, there was between them. It is surprising that so many intelligent people who were involved in the discussions leading up to the ceasefire did not think to clarify that matter. When I became Taoiseach in December 1994 I had to deal with this.</P>
    <P>I made substantial efforts to get Sinn Féin into the talks. One of the initiatives I took was the appointment of Senator Mitchell. He presented a report to the two Government on 24 January 1996, following, I believe, discussions he had with the IRA. In his report he said he had received a commitment from all to work constructively to achieve full decommissioning as part of the pro<Col N="1555" /> cess. He went on to say that he had got assurances that decommissioning was agreed to be part of the process by the paramilitaries, including the IRA. Thirteen days after that report was delivered Canary Wharf was bombed with the murder of two civilians. There are legitimate questions for historians to address as to how Senator Mitchell was led to believe there was an acceptance of a commitment to decommissioning so near to the use of those weapons at Canary Wharf.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad to say an approach was found through the electoral route to get to the talks that would include Sinn Féin. Many Nationalists criticised the electoral route at the time but I believed then and believe now that it was a sensible way to overcome the difficulties facing Unionists. It was the right approach. I am glad it was possible for me as Taoiseach to get agreement on a date &ndash; 10 June 1996 &ndash; for the talks to start and I am also glad it was possible for me in a summit I had with Prime Minister Blair in May and in a subsequent summit I had with him in June in New York to agree on the establishment of an international commission on weapons. It is important to recognise that the de Chastelain commission was put in place at a summit involving Prime Minister Blair and myself.</P>
    <P>A number of remaining questions need to be addressed. What will happen to the command structures of the various paramilitary groupings? Will the loyalists decommission? It is essential that they do so immediately. Will the republican and loyalists punishment beatings stop? These have no place in a democracy and they are occurring on both sides of the Border, in Dundalk as well as in Northern Ireland. They must stop.</P>
    <P>Having asked these questions we must celebrate the achievement of yesterday and congratulate all concerned, including those involved in the republican movement in the decision they have taken. An option for democracy has been taken by everybody on this side of the Border. I am glad it has and I am also glad to have lived to see it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the action taken yesterday to implement the Good Friday Agreement. It is an important step in ensuring the Agreement is implemented in all its aspects. For many living in this State there must, of necessity, be a more quiet and calm approach to this problem. It is difficult for us to understand the passion and intensity which characterise the views of many North of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Ó Caoláin recommending changes in our practices in this State in relation to the Offences against the State Act and the issue of Northern representation in the Oireachtas. However, the biggest change that must take place in this part of Ireland is a recognition and understanding by those who live here of the conditions in Northern Ireland. If there is one mote in our eyes it is a lack of awareness and knowledge of them, including the very deep <Col N="1556" /> communal tensions that exist, their origins and how they reflect themselves in popular practices today. On this day, which is another day on which we benchmark our progress on the Northern Ireland question, I urge all in this part of Ireland to consider that we are not fully familiar with the conditions in Northern Ireland and with the huge changes that have taken place there in recent years, including the huge economic and demographic changes, which will have serious implications for us in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement made this afternoon by the Secretary of State in relation to demilitarisation. It is an essential concomitant of the progress made yesterday on the putting of arms beyond use.</P>
    <P>There was much discussion earlier on the nature of republicanism. In this part of Ireland the 1937 vote on the Constitution was the first referendum in our political history. By that vote the people in the greater part of this island adopted a constitution for themselves. Since then there can be no argument that we do not operate in a legitimate republican state in which we have government of the people, for the people and by the people. The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, is part of the necessary machinery of the State. It has to exist because the State has to be able to defend itself against subversion. That subversion does not originate in any one source. We need only look around the world today to see the different sources from which it may come.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision made yesterday as another step in realising the republic we all want to see. That will be a united republican Ireland.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement made yesterday by the IRA that it is to start decommissioning its arms. It is a significant event that will give a huge psychological boost to the peace process. We hope it is the quantum leap we have all waited for in that process. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland indicated yesterday that there would be a quick response to the changes and my information is that the demilitarisation of south Armagh began today with the removal of the lookout post at Camlough. The intention is to move on to Newtownhamilton tomorrow. Clearly, the quicker they get to Crossmaglen and Glassdrummond the better because the lookout posts have been the source of much irritation down through the years. They are hugely symbolic as far as the local communities are concerned. Coming so quickly after decommissioning, the move will be a major confidence building measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to put decommissioning in context. It is merely a stage in the evolution and development of the peace process. The problems in north Belfast where children have been intimidated on their way to school will have to be addressed quickly. The issue of loyalist decom<Col N="1557" /> missioning will have to be considered and the quicker it can be put in place the better. On reflection, the process, from the first ceasefire in 1994, has travelled a tortuous path. It is important that, as decommissioning commences, the plight of families bereaved during the Troubles of the past 30 years is not lost sight of. As the process evolves it is a matter that will require considerable attention. The roots of much of the hatred and antagonism are clearly in the many brutal, horrific murders committed during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. I hope the subject will be addressed. Many of those murders were committed not far from my own boundary in north Louth and we certainly would like to see them addressed. We must have regard for the plight, state of mind and position of the families of the victims of all of the sectarian murders that have been committed right across Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan referred to the demographic shift taking place in Northern Ireland and that is a hidden dynamic in the changes occurring there. There have been very significant population changes that in time will have implications for the electoral process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Kirk's generous decision to afford me the opportunity to speak. It is a historic day and this is a historic debate. It is a pity there are not more people here to witness it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the IRA on its groundbreaking statement. It marks the end of an era &ndash; an epoch almost &ndash; in Irish history. It is the end of the rugged, stubborn tradition of physical force nationalism trying to provide a solution to the problems on this island. I congratulate the IRA on its wise decision. We are now leaving that <i>cul de sac</i> for the open road of constitutional politics. It is important to remember that this is not an act of decommissioning. It is the putting of weapons beyond use and that is appropriate and right. The solution of putting them beyond use is the best one because it does not pander to those, including some on the negative side of the Unionist community, who want the white flag to be run up and to humiliate those who have been involved in paramilitarism. They wanted to humiliate them at the door of democracy. That is not appropriate if one is trying to build a new democracy as we are trying to do on this island. It is important to move beyond the weapons issue. We have to put the whole panoply of paramilitarism beyond use also. Paramilitary structures must be dismantled if people are to participate fully in democracy on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found it very odd to hear Deputy John Bruton describe Sinn Féin and the IRA as the republican movement. I violently disagree with that assertion. The republican movement is not confined to Sinn Féin or the IRA and it is not the exclusive property of any party, including my own, in this House. It is not the property of any party north of the Border. It is the inheritance and legacy of this State and of all people on this <Col N="1558" /> island. No party has an exclusive right to republican sentiment. The republican movement is the movement that founded this State and it is the movement which will establish an all-Ireland democracy and republic within five to 15 years. It is the aim of all right-thinking republicans to establish a united Ireland &ndash; united politically and in every other sense &ndash; by peaceful and proper constitutional methods and using persuasion. We wish to persuade our colleagues and partners in this journey, the Unionists and the people of the Orange tradition, to come with us on the high road to Irish unity. I resent the fact that people are describing those two parties as the republican movement. They are not. It is a much wider affair than they make out. The ground-breaking nature of the Good Friday Agreement and the referendum that followed from it constituted the first great act of Irish sovereignty. As a national people we decide our destiny. The choice of 1918 was forced. It was an act of sovereignty, an act of people voting themselves out of the United Kingdom, but it was forced by circumstances. The Unionists did not approve or agree. The Good Friday Agreement is the great act of Irish sovereignty and we are now on the high moral road to Irish unity. It may not be the unity of which Pearse and Connolly dreamed, but it may be a more practical and real one. Hopefully we will achieve it within our lifetimes.</P>

      <P>I recognise the presence of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. I congratulate them and their officials, who are in many cases nameless faces to the public. They have put a huge amount of effort into this process down the years which it is only right to acknowledge. I present the thanks of all Members of the House to former Taoisigh, Deputies Albert Reynolds and John Bruton, for the contribution they have made since the beginning of this part of the process in the early 1990s. It would be churlish of us not to recognise that there were very difficult times during this process but throughout we, in this republic, were very fortunate to have a leadership that was clear and determined about what it wanted to achieve in terms of a new dispensation between the peoples of Northern Ireland and the Republic and the peoples of Britain and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome yesterday's decision by the IRA to start the decommissioning of its illegally held weapons. At last, it has realised the expressed wishes of the Irish and British people. It is part of our past and not our future. At last, the IRA has realised the self-determination of the Irish people, as expressed clearly and democratically in the forging of the Good Friday Agreement. The people of Ireland, North and South, and of Britain should be congratulated for their patience, courage and forbearance in the face of the actions of the IRA over the past 30 years. We should remember all the victims of IRA violence &ndash; the 1,800 people who were systematically <Col N="1559" /> killed and murdered and their families. We should pay homage to them.</P>
    <P>The campaign of the IRA has come to an end because politics has won. This represents a huge step forward for everyone, particularly the people of Northern Ireland. Removing violence, once and for all, will allow true reconciliation to take place among the people of Northern Ireland and between the North and South. This final piece of the jigsaw will allow the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland to be restored.</P>
    <P>I welcome Mr. Trimble's announcement in the House of Commons this afternoon that he has decided to renominate UUP Ministers to the power-sharing executive. I also welcome the statement of the Northern Secretary, Dr. John Reid, in respect of the British government's decision to demolish a number of British installations along the border. Demilitarisation is now happening.</P>
    <P>From the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, through to the historic Downing Street Declaration in the early 1990s and the Good Friday Agreement, it has been absolutely clear that a new dispensation was required to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland. Irish nationalism had to change in recognising the position of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland and, equally, unionism had to recognise the intrinsic rights of the entire Nationalist community in all parts of Ireland. We have come a long way since the historic shift in the mid-1980s.</P>
    <P>As I said, the IRA represents part of our past. It was an ugly past, a past that refused to recognise the multi-layered allegiances that many people in this country have, a past that we must not relive. The IRA's nationalism was exclusivist, sectarian and tribal. It was a mirror reflection of the very worst examples of loyalism, which is still evident on the streets of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September were central in the IRA taking this final decision to move away from violence and to disarm. It is no longer credible to have a political party and a military wing working hand in hand and suggesting, especially to senior politicians in America, that that can be tenable. This has now changed and the announcement yesterday has changed it forever.</P>
    <P>There is now an opportunity, which Sinn Féin should grasp, to take part in the new policing dispensation. The real architects of this process, John Hume and the members of the SDLP, had the courage to nominate people to the policing board. I do not believe there is now any reason Sinn Féin should refuse to nominate people to that board. As Deputy Currie and others have said this evening, we have to ensure a new policing regime is established and that the allegiance of Nationalists, republicans, loyalists and Unionists is given to it. It is a central part of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>This is a great day for everyone in Britain and Ireland. We should welcome it. We should also remember that there are many people who will <Col N="1560" /> find it difficult to accept the new situation &ndash; the victims of violence, loyalist and republican. This must be given due regard. I agree with Deputy Kirk that, in the days ahead, that must be fully recognised in whatever agreement we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members from both sides of the House who have contributed. The Government was happy to respond to the request for a debate on the developments in the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>For the past few months, it was not clear, despite our continuing, intensive and best efforts, whether the political institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement would be able to survive in the face of all the continuing difficulties. We were fast approaching a juncture where we could have either fatally lost momentum or looked to a future based on the valuable and irreplaceable institutions established under the Agreement.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that, at this critical turning point, we succeeded in making the type of crucial progress that was so essential in countering the deepening political and public despondency. The patience that was such an obvious hallmark of our efforts has been rewarded. The future now appears more secure as a result. We have a responsibility to take full advantage of the new circumstances and to approach the challenges ahead in a new and more optimistic spirit.</P>
      <P>There have been many historic moments and events in recent years in relation to the peace process. The Government gladly acknowledges the work of other Governments &ndash; the work of Albert Reynolds, John Bruton and others. At times, the processes that brought us these historic developments have been difficult and tortuous.</P>
      <P>For the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself, the issue of decommissioning has, from the beginning, probably been the most difficult. This is true for everyone involved, especially for the republican movement. For that reason, we have spent an enormous amount of time this year, never mind other years, trying to find a resolution to this problem. However, the republican movement has now taken the historic step necessary to give the process new momentum. This development is of profound historic importance and deserves a generous response, as it is receiving here in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I have just met Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. I pay tribute to their efforts and acknowledge the key role they have played in bringing us to this point. I fully acknowledge what this decision means for the republican movement and its leadership. It was a difficult decision for them, but it was the right one. It was essential if the peace process was to be saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time of renewed confidence and hope, we should, however, pause to remember the victims of the strife and turmoil in Northern Ireland. There have been so many down through the decades. The euphoria of this moment, when the future suddenly seems so much brighter, should <Col N="1561" /> not be allowed to obscure the suffering and loss that have affected almost every family across both communities in Northern Ireland. In our commitment to keep moving forward, we are determined that we must never allow a resumption of the chaos and hardship that were so much a part, for so long, of daily life in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the integrity and commitment which General de Chastelain and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning has demonstrated in their tireless and painstaking efforts to fulfil their remit. I believe our confidence in Mr. de Chastelain and the work of the IICD has been fully rewarded with their confirmation yesterday evening that they had witnessed an event &ndash; which they regarded as significant &ndash; in which the IRA had put a quantity of arms, ammunition and explosives completely beyond use.</P>
    <P>This represents unprecedented progress in the resolution of the arms issue. The report reinforces the Government's view that it is only through the commission that the putting of paramilitary arms beyond use can be achieved. The commission has said that it will maintain its contact with the IRA representative in pursuit of its mandate.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate also that I should extend my appreciation to the two international inspectors, President Martti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa, who have announced today that their work has come to an end. They have played a key role at a vital point in the peace process &ndash; I acknowledge this and the contribution they have made. I thank them for the amount of time they invested in the process over the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>I believe we can now, and must, move forward on the basis of the IRA's statement. We have lost valuable time, but it is not too late to make up lost ground. It is clear that all of the pro-Agreement parties recognise that this move offers the breakthrough we have all sought. I welcome David Trimble's positive response and his decision to recommend to his party executive that the Ulster Unionist Party return to the Northern Ireland Executive and to nominate his colleagues again.</P>
    <P>It is essential that all aspects of the Agreement should be implemented in full and on a sustained basis. We believe that yesterday's development makes it not only possible but essential for all to play their part in bringing about the full implementation of the Agreement. All parties to the Agreement must play their full part in the institutions and enable the other parties to play their rightful role. As regards the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council, we look forward to all Ministers participating fully in all meetings relevant to their responsibilities. The future in Northern Ireland must be based on democratic politics, equal and fair treatment of both communities, freedom from the threat or use of paramilitary weapons in pursuit of political ends and the dismantling of the military and <Col N="1562" /> security infrastructure that this new situation will allow.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement reached on 10 April 1998 received an historic endorsement by the people in referendums North and South. Constitutional arrangements to reflect fully the principles of consent and self-determination have been brought into effect. Devolved institutions, which brought power and accountability closer to the people, demonstrated that the parties could work together for the common interest. The putting of arms beyond use is just one of the essential elements in implementing the Agreement. The discussions between the parties and both Governments at Weston Park also set out the other elements which will deliver the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As regards policing, I believe we now have the conditions for the delivery of the spirit and substance of the Patten report. I have already warmly welcomed the decision by the SDLP, John Hume and his colleague, Seamus Mallon, to make nominations to the Policing Board and district policing partnerships. I wish the chairman and vice-chairman of the board, Professor Desmond Rea and Denis Bradley, and all the members every success in their important work which will begin in earnest on 4 November when the name of the RUC will change and the powers of the new board are commenced. I hope Sinn Féin will in time also find it possible to participate and contribute to the new beginning in policing. It is precisely at this time, as the new police service is developing, that it can make an especially valuable contribution. For its part, the Government will ensure the Garda Síochána will work closely with the new police service to do everything possible to combat any dissident threat and to enable the normalisation of security arrangements.</P>
    <P>The implementation of legislation and other measures in respect of the justice system in Northern Ireland is also of crucial importance. The justice system must deliver justice effectively and efficiently to the community through a fair and impartial system which encourages community involvement, has the confidence of all parts of the community and is staffed in accordance with the rigorous application of the highest standards of fair employment and equality of opportunity for the community as a whole. I look forward to the publication of the implementation plan for the criminal justice review together with the draft legislation with a view to the early passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the continued security presence in Nationalist and republican areas has been a source of deep concern and disappointment to people living there. The commencement of decommissioning of IRA weapons has, however, totally changed the prevailing security context. We want to see the position on the ground transformed for everyone so that there are no surveillance towers, troops on the streets or routine helicopter use. In plain terms, we want to see normal policing and security supported by the com<Col N="1563" /> munity. We want to see a return as soon as possible to such normal security arrangements in Northern Ireland. Today's announcement by the Secretary of State is a welcome and positive development and is a step in the right direction. It signals the beginning of a new era for republican and Nationalist areas of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the British Government's commitment to carrying out a progressive rolling programme reducing levels of troops and installations in Northern Ireland. A progressive, imaginative and determined approach is necessary. Expectations are high and people will expect to see real change for the better at an early stage. That is very important for the process and we hope the British Government understands that. We have made the point to it and I am sure it will understand so that we can proceed with great momentum.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement, when implemented in full, will establish for the first time in Northern Ireland a new and democratic framework which has widespread legitimacy on a cross-community basis. In bringing in these changes, we are making the changes necessary to transform a society in conflict to a society at peace. One of the significant challenges we are faced with is convincing those who remain in the mindset of conflict and division that times have changed and that equality and equal opportunities, justice and security are for everyone. These are not concessions but basic rights which belong to everyone in a free and democratic society. The Government and I know the British Government is absolutely committed to the implementation in full of the Good Friday Agreement and to advancing progress comprehensively on all outstanding matters. The statements issued by the two Governments last night make this abundantly clear.</P>
    <P>From the beginning of this process, the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement, the long road through the winter of 1997 and 1998 and the implementation of the Agreement since April 1998, the US Administration has played a pivotal role in the peace process. The support of our friends in Congress has also been crucial and I welcome the statements by President Bush, Senator Kennedy and all the statements of support we have received. In recent weeks, regardless of their difficulties, Ambassador Haass has remained in close touch with us and that has been the case right up to yesterday when he discussed the ongoing and latest developments with the Minister, Deputy Cowen. We thank him for that. He is a new friend but an especially good one to us in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The events of 11 September have reverberated around the world. We as a nation have expressed our solidarity with the American people in their time of trial. It is right that we have done so and we will continue to do so. Through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including the putting of weapons beyond use, we <Col N="1564" /> are conveying to the international community our commitment on this island to peace, reconciliation and a future determined by democratic means and consent. In the current difficult international environment, I am glad we have been able to demonstrate that progress is possible through active and imaginative political engagement. At my recent meeting with the European Commission, I also acknowledged and expressed our appreciation for the role the Commission has played in advancing peace and reconciliation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland in recent times has begun to emerge from the very dark shadows of the past. The peace has not been perfect, but there are many more people alive today than would otherwise have been if we had not started this journey of peace some years ago. There has also been a resurgence of urban renewal programmes and increased economic activity and prosperity. The alternative is not to be contemplated. We have witnessed elsewhere recently the terrible consequences when momentum is lost and violence returns.</P>
    <P>The historic division and conflict in Northern Ireland is not of this generation's making. In this situation, creating peace and a process of reconciliation must be worked at. There is nothing as easy as retreating to the slogans of the past, but that will do nothing but perpetuate division and pass it on to another generation. That is certainly not something we want to do. Our contribution must ensure the conflict ends here and that we can move on to a new generation without the conflict, hatred and division of the past.</P>
    <P>The situation at Holy Cross school is deeply depressing. A way must be found to end the protest and bring people together. There is an alternative to sectarian division and strife. It is dialogue and mutual respect. Given what has happened in recent days, I urge people on all sides to help us, the Secretary of State and the parties to find a resolution to this issue. Children cannot be expected to understand all this and should not be brought into it. It is easier, although not that easy, for adults to live with this, but children should not be asked to live with this every day because, if it is not stopped, they will remember it forever and it will only toughen and harden them and make them bitter when they are older. I appeal to people to stop it forthwith.</P>

      <P>I hope that, with the renewed energy in politics in Northern Ireland, those in a position to influence will address and actively seek to resolve the continuing problems throughout north Belfast. An early resolution of this sad situation would be a clear indication that politics in Northern Ireland has taken a new direction for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an opportunity now for all those with influence over other paramilitary organisations to reflect on the new situation and use their <Col N="1565" /> influence positively. An opportunity exists to work intensively to take weapons out of use for good and to ensure that we will never again see the horrific violence of the past. This is needed not to prop up Sinn Féin in government but for the integrity of democracy in Northern Ireland. There is an enormous amount of work to be done. It is now time to return to the ordinary work of democratic politics for everyone.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive, I look forward with my colleagues to the renewal and enhancement of the work of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council. It is exactly a year ago this Saturday that this work was interrupted. We look forward this weekend to taking up where we left off last year. It did not stop totally and useful work was done. However, not everyone was involved so it was not inclusive and that created difficulties. We have the opportunity to get back to working together for all the people of this island. I urge all the parties to grasp this opportunity and ensure that stable, democratic local government endures.</P>
    <P>As we look to the future, we know that we have the right political infrastructure in the Good</P>
    <P>Friday Agreement, which has proven to be resilient over this period. There will be further challenges and difficulties in the months and years ahead but we will surmount them. We know there are those who will test or undermine it at every opportunity, but I assure the House that we will continue to invest all our energies and efforts into meeting these challenges and making the agreement work as it was intended for the benefit of all the people in Northern Ireland and these islands generally.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who offered their congratulations to those involved. I refer to the officials concerned who worked extremely hard in the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and my own Department. I thank, in particular, my colleagues, Deputy O'Donnell, the Minister of State, and the Ministers, Deputy John O'Donoghue and especially Deputy Brian Cowen who was with me every day of this phase of the negotiations which started on 11 January and concluded last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Neville and McGahon. I agree with the broad thrust of the motion. However, I remember we debated the same topic a few years ago. I was elected in 1997, but Sellafield, or Windscale as it was, has existed for decades. Have we used this issue as a political football? What can we do? There is much rhetoric about it. It is strange that we heard how the Irish and British Governments were in consultation over the IRA decommissioning issue, but on this issue we are discussing taking them to court. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has done much hard work in recent years. It was said that the Government reneged on its support of him, but I know that he is capable of doing the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are all political parties being honest with the people? I do not know what we can do. There are fine suggestions in the motion, such as the reconstitution of the team of scientific and legal experts. It deplores the downgrading and inactivity of the inter-ministerial working party. <Col N="1569" /> These must be examined, but we must consider what we could do if there were a catastrophe similar to 11 September, as has been said. Do we have an early warning system?</P>
    <P>Is the country willing to properly fund protective measures? I am familiar with the Civil Defence's equipment and believe that there was never the will to put a proper defensive system in place. If the public are willing to pay for it, then let us do it. If not, then let us remain as we are and be honest about it. We should check with our colleagues in Britain on the current security arrangements at Sellafield which they say they can deal with through interceptor aircraft or anti-aircraft missiles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>The nuclear reactor plant at Sellafield is a time bomb waiting to go off. The British Government's decision to commission the MOX fuel production plant is contemptible given the view of successive Irish Governments and especially of the potential danger it poses to this State. It is obvious that Britain has no interest in our views. Our attempts to influence Britain were ineffective and a waste of time. This must change and the Government must change its softly softly approach of the past four years. Tonight we have the same language. We have threats and attempts to talk tough. The Minister of State said last night that he would not be deterred. Britain is not listening and the result is that Sellafied, with its attendant dangers, is not closed down and the MOX plant is proceeding. I call on the Taoiseach to tap into his special relationship with the British Prime Minister and inform him of our concerns, the dangers and the fears we have about the destruction of most of the State as a result of an accident at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The campaign to close it down has fallen on deaf ears. and is constantly and contemptuously rebuffed. Britain sees this as an economic issue. BNFL is one of the biggest such operations in the world with an annual turnover of £2.5 billion and an annual profit of £250 million. It is obviously an extremely efficient commercial operation employing 16,000 in Britain and 20,000 worldwide. The Irish people's concern and our health and environmental issues, as well as those of part of Britain, are of secondary importance to this massive money making operation which produces cheap electricity for the British economy. We live under the threat of an accident at Sellafield and have sustained a torrent of lies from Britain about leaks. We have no confidence in any British assurance and are horrified at the falsification of data on the trade with Japan which led to that Government breaking its contract with Sellafield. Whether an accident or a terrorist attack, an explosion at Sellafield would cause massive fallout, terrible loss of life and unbelievable suffering, both short and long-term for the Irish people.</P>

We have the highest rates of cancer and leukaemia in the country, an unhappy statistic we share with south County Down. Every County Louth person feels menaced by Sellafield, just across the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>I am cynical and see it being used as a political football. If this Government leaves office, the issue will reappear on the political agenda in a few months and many of the arguments we make here tonight will be used by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concerned for a moment that my constituency colleagues would be at loggerheads on this issue. In general terms, it is reasonable to say a broad political consensus is emerging on the serious hazard that arises from the presence of the Sellafield plant in close proximity to the east coast. In regard to the events of 11 September in America where terrorists crashed planes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon building, there are few on the face of the planet who realistically thought that was something that might happen. However, it did and the result was the death of thousands of people in horrific circumstances. The events of 11 September and their impact on thinking in different places have been cited a few times dur<Col N="1571" /> ing this debate. Those events have heightened the awareness of the hazards involved with Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Let us consider what might happen and the horrific circumstances we would face, particularly on the east coast if a similar terrorist attack were to be launched on the Sellafield plant. Imagine trying to evacuate the towns of Dundalk and Drogheda, the city of Dublin, and the towns and villages along the east coast and probably further afield into the midlands.</P>
      <P>We have had the unfortunate experience of Chernobyl, the fall-out from it and the implications for populations far removed from that plant.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the British Government is acting like the neighbours from hell on this issue. It is adopting the approach that Sellafield is part and parcel of the infrastructure of its economy and the hazards inherently involved in its location for the people of Ireland appear far down its list of priorities.</P>
      <P>The time has come when the issue will have to be taken much more seriously. I am pleased the Government has decided to initiate serious court proceedings about it. Since the issue has been taken up we have to go after it through every fora and every platform. There is no doubt that if it is allowed to expand, as the British Government proposes with the MOX development, there will be an increased danger and hazard on our doorstep.</P>
      <P>We will dust down and update the national emergency plan but the question arises as to how effective that emergency plan would be in the catastrophe we would face in the event of a serious accident at Sellafield. There are regular reports of minor accidents which are talked down. If there are minor accidents there can be more serious accidents, the implications of which are very serious.</P>
      <P>Due to the enhanced economic significance of the nuclear industry in other member states I am concerned that we as a non-nuclear State have a reduced voice in the fora that discusses these issues throughout Europe. The French and others would probably broadly support the British position because they have a nuclear industry to think of and are looking at its relative importance to their position. We do not have such an industry here and there is a strong view among our population that Sellafield should not be on our doorstep either.</P>
      <P>If we can get the political consensus from this debate to accelerate the Government's efforts to have Sellafield closed that is what we should do because the price, the hazards and the dangers involved are too serious to contemplate for a population which is only 50 or 60 miles away from that plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke last weekend at a conference in London organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In that speech I was highly critical of the Government on its for<Col N="1572" /> eign policy, the Nice Treaty, neutrality and the war in Afghanistan. When I turned to the issue of Sellafield I felt it was right to concur with the Taoiseach's strong statement when he said he was appalled at the decision of the British Government, announced in the most underhand way, to authorise a MOX plant at Sellafield. Now is the time for Irish people to speak with one voice on this vital issue.</P>
      <P>The plant at Sellafield is a threat to the very existence of the Irish people. A major accident at the plant would cause such devastation on this island that the future of human society here would be in doubt. Huge swathes of Britain would be similarly affected. This grim reality must be the basis of our approach to the campaign to close Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments, including this one, have not done enough to fight Sellafield diplomatically, politically and legally. All parties who participated in governments share that responsibility but now is not the time for recriminations about past failures. We must have maximum unity around the demand of the Irish people for the complete closure of this death plant, this potential Chernobyl on our doorstep.</P>
      <P>I agree with most of the Labour Party motion, in particular its demands for further action from the Government but, with respect, the Labour Party has missed a golden opportunity to unite the House around a motion that all could endorse. The Government would not ever have supported a motion which included sections deploring its actions. I note in passing that the Labour motion speaks of Irish inspectors being stationed permanently at the plant. There should be nothing permanent about Sellafield, it should just go.</P>
      <P>It is a rare moment, but I agree with Deputy McGahon when he urges a consensus approach. We need all parties and all Members of this House to come together in a unanimous commitment to comprehensive action by the Government and a united demand on behalf of the Irish people to the British Government for the closure of Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I have this evening, written to the Leaders of all parties and to the Independent members in the House seeking such a consensus for united action. I feel so strongly on this point that I am willing to support the Government amendment in a practical demonstration of my commitment to a united approach. Now is the time for united purpose and united action. It is not the time for party political point scoring. It may give us short-term satisfaction and marginal electoral advantage to have a go at the Administration for not doing enough but in this crisis it only serves to dissipate vital energy which must be used to campaign to get the MOX plant stopped and to get Sellafield closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions between the parties and the drafting of a motion could have achieved a unanimous vote. We must seek to achieve that in the time ahead so that the message goes out to the world <Col N="1573" /> that there is total unanimity against Sellafield and behind a forceful campaign for its closure.</P>
    <P>When he approved the decision to open a MOX plant at Sellafield earlier this month, the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was guilty of an act of bad faith and disregard for the Irish people on a par with anything done by his predecessors in the long and sorry history of Anglo Irish relations. Many in this House have scorned Sinn Féin when we have pointed out the delays, the failures and the bad faith of the British Government at various stages of the peace process. At the root of that bad faith is the historic disregard for the Irish people which still persists among large sections of official Britain. Nowhere is that better illustrated than in their contempt for Irish opinion on Sellafield. However, the British Government also displays a disregard for its own people. What a sad indictment of the Labour Government that it must advance the argument about the employment of the workforce in Sellafield in order to defend the plant. Does it regard the health and the very lives of the workers at Sellafield and their families as less precious than their numerical strength as a workforce when the local and national employment figures are tallied? If the British Labour Party had been true to its best traditions it would have had a plan in place even before it came into office after Major's Government to close this plant and establish sustainable employment for its workers.</P>
    <P>This grave and imminent danger to all our lives requires unprecedented action. We should establish in the Oireachtas an all-party action committee to forge a united and effective approach. The party leaders in this House and, if possible, those in the Assembly in the Six Counties should come together at the earliest opportunity, in a very public way, to lead the campaign for closure. Governments are usually very reluctant to engage in overt political campaigning which includes public protests and demonstrations. They are even more reluctant to support and participate in such campaigns in the jurisdictions of other states. However, now is not the time for diplomatic niceties. I would urge a mass public campaign in both Ireland and Britain, spearheaded by the Irish Government and Irish political parties and mobilising people power to have this plant shut down. We must deploy every possible method in this campaign, diplomatic, legal and political. We need to mobilise the wide support the closure demand enjoys within Britain itself.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government well in its legal action but it cannot and must not rely solely on this approach. Political pressure at national and international level and the deployment of people power is what will close Sellafield. Let us maximise the pressure, let us send out the demand, loud and clear, to the British Government to decommission its deadly nuclear industry now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Miss Fox Miss Fox">
      <NameTxt>Miss Fox:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about an issue which has been of interest to me <Col N="1574" /> in recent years. I am pleased it is again being debated in this House as it deserves attention.</P>
      <P>This should not be a party political issue. Sellafield has always been a matter of grave public concern, but successive Governments have failed to secure its closure despite the fact that this aim has appeared on many election manifestos. I am sure this issue will be dusted off once more in the coming months with greater urgency, particularly in light of the events of 11 September.</P>
      <P>I have had the pleasure of visiting Sellafield in the past and while I was there I visited the THORP nuclear reprocessing plant. This plant takes waste from 30 nuclear reactors located in nine countries worldwide and reprocesses it. In other words, it takes spent nuclear waste from across the world and brings it to Ireland's doorstep, all in the interests of making a profit.</P>
      <P>The safety record of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. is dreadful. It has a litany of cover-ups to its name and yet it seems to continue to thrive. BNFL is a profit-making company which has a very close relationship with the British Government, the very organ of state responsible for policing it. It has the full support of the British Government and advises it on how it should respond to Irish concerns. It has advised the British Government in the past that it should be assertive and not appear to justify or apologise for the UK nuclear industry. It has its own set of rules on how to deal with Irish people. BNFL even tells the British Government which Minister should respond to letters from Ireland, suggesting that a lower ranking Minister should reply to us lowly Independents. It has worded responses for Ministers of the British Government which, to a degree, that Administration has accepted word for word. All of these documents were uncovered and featured on Channel 4's &ldquo;Dispatches&rdquo; programme.</P>
      <P>This is not a healthy relationship between a government and a profit-making company in anybody's language, particularly a company that has been guilty of successive cover-ups. In another leaked memo, the company admitted that it was not complying with guidelines which govern the reporting of incidents. It admitted that it was doing less than it was required to do. However, what is worse is that the British Government's Department of Trade and Industry's view at that time was that it should let sleeping dogs lie. Again, those responsible for policing this facility knew that BNFL was not complying with an agreement on incident reporting. However, instead of taking action against the company it advised that nothing should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In almost every case, BNFL has had to admit wrongdoing only after it was caught red-handed. This company should not be left in charge of a nuclear facility. British Nuclear Fuels has treated the concerns of Irish people in an arrogant and dismissive manner. Its actions have been condoned by the British Government, which has now rewarded it by allowing it to extend the MOX facility at Sellafield. This is not the first occasion on which the British Government has partici<Col N="1575" /> pated in a cover-up. One need only refer to the Beaufort Dyke arms issue in that regard. We have been let down by the British Government, Europe and successive Irish Administrations, which failed to take legal action until now. If we had half the courage and conviction of the Dundalk residents' group, which fought BNFL when nobody else was willing to do so, things could be very different today.</P>
    <P>Much has been made in recent weeks of accident and emergency plans in the event of a plane crashing into Sellafield. However, not much attention has been given to the rooms full of research on the effects of low levels of radiation on people's health. Research has been carried out by Irish scientists such as Carmel Mothersill who claims a link between genomic instability and low levels of ionising radiation. The results of this research have been confirmed by the Harvard School of Public Health and other renowned institutions such as the University of California.</P>
    <P>Despite these concerns and this research, BNFL still ships nuclear fuel via the Irish Sea and along the coast from the port of Barrow to the THORP nuclear reprocessing plant. It is stored and monitored at Sellafield where it is eventually reprocessed. The result of this reprocessing is that radioactive materials are emitted into Irish air and into the Irish Sea. This may not be as dramatic as a terrorist attack but it is more than likely still detrimental to the health of residents, albeit more slowly and in an ongoing, unseen and unchecked way.</P>
    <P>BNFL is actively pursuing as many contracts as possible. There is only one other comparable facility in the region which is located in France, so it stands to reason that BNFL will increase its business and continue to thrive. At present, Tony Blair is falling over himself to hold hands with George Bush and is pontificating about respect and tolerance between nations. He should apply these ideals to the relationship between his country and that of his immediate neighbours, all of whom have signed up to the OSPAR Convention. He has conveniently ignored his obligations under this convention and he cannot be allowed to continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, on his hard work in this area. Unfortunately, the only attention he has received has been when things go wrong. However, I am aware that he has worked extremely hard on this issue. The time to reason with the British Government is long gone because it is clear that the Administration in question is not impartial. Legal action is long overdue and it is the only way to resolve this matter, once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years Sellafield has posed the most serious threat to public health and environmental well-being in Ireland and that threat has been allowed to remain in existence for far too long. The Government's position remains unchanged. We demand that Sellafield be shut <Col N="1576" /> down and we will not cease our campaign until it is closed, once and for all.</P>
      <P>I am appalled and angered by the decision of the UK Government to proceed with the MOX plant. At a time of international stress following the events of 11 September, one would presume that the UK Government would be concentrating on dealing with the threat to Britain's safety and security. Instead, it made the appalling decision to allow the expansion of this potentially deadly plant. If the British Government believes that its decision will go unnoticed or that it will pale into insignificance in comparison with the current international crisis, it is very much mistaken. This decision is significant to the Irish people and the Government will continue to fight it.</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions we have expressed our firm opposition to the opening of the MOX plant. We have provided the UK Government with detailed responses to the five consultations carried out in respect of the plant. We have initiated legal action against the UK under the OSPAR Convention. We are currently finalising consideration of further legal options against the UK under EU law, the EURATOM Treaty and the EU Treaty. If our concerns are not taken on board by the UK Government we will continue to take legal action to the fullest extent of international law. To claim this Government has done nothing is a nonsense. It is clear that the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has been relentless in his fight against Sellafield and the commissioning of the MOX plant. I commend his unyielding efforts. I was delighted to hear Deputy Fox give an Independent view of the Minister of State's view and commend him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that the House support this motion. For far too long the Irish Sea has been used as a dumping ground for Sellafield. The opening of the MOX plant will only add to this horrendous pollution, which continues to pose a threat to our public health, environment and industries such as fishing, agriculture and tourism. It is not acceptable for the Irish Sea to be used as a sewerage service for the Sellafield plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest fear of the Government and the public is of an accident at the site. Until recently the likelihood of this fear becoming a reality was quite slim if one listened to the British side. However, due to the events of last month, it is now imperative that the capacity of those nuclear plants to withstand similar terrorist attacks is seriously examined. A major accident in this plant would affect the whole of Ireland, including my county of Cork. We must stand together in our campaign to shut the MOX plant and eventually the Sellafield plant once and for all. It will not do to use this serious matter as a ploy to gain political points. It is essential to take swift action <Col N="1577" /> in our fight against the opening of the MOX plant and there is no time here for bickering and scoring points. That is why I am asking the Opposition to support the Government amendment. We cannot and will not allow this issue to rest. It is the Government's aim to prevent the opening of the MOX plant and to close Sellafield once and for all. We will not cease in our fight against this nuclear monstrosity until it is won.</P>
    <P>I commend all the organisations involved in caring for the victims of Chernobyl. That nuclear tragedy was the worst the world has ever experienced and is a reminder to all of us of the devastation and destruction a nuclear accident can cause due to radioactive material escaping into the atmosphere. A whole generation of children has been born in Belarus with serious defects in their immune systems or with limbs missing and other deformities. That is the tragedy of nuclear fallout caused by human error. Voluntary groups in Ireland have done much to bring happiness to those children, with trips to Ireland, hospital care and operations. I thank the thousands who have contributed to the mercy missions to Belarus and other areas, providing food, clothes, ambulances, workers and specialists. They have all been part of the convoys of help which have gone to the affected areas over the past ten years. On behalf of all Members I salute those who have been involved in the voluntary effort, which is wonderful.</P>
    <P>I have attended a number of functions in Cork for the Chernobyl Children's Project. Adi Roche is a Labour Party member and was at its conference but I salute her for the work she has done on behalf of the children of Chernobyl. A number of groups has formed as a result of her pioneering work and it is tremendous to see so many groups around the country involved in such work. I pay particular tribute to hospital staff who are involved in lifesaving operations for children who have suffered as a result of this fallout. The Mercy Hospital, Cork, has played a role, as has University College Hospital, St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital and the South Infirmary.</P>
    <P>More importantly, people have adopted children from Belarus who are not 100% physically. There is tremendous credit due to any adoptive parent who would show such love to children who so desperately need to be brought up in an environment where they can have some peace and happiness in their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support this motion. I wish to share my time with Deputies Wall, Bell, Upton, McManus and Rabbitte. This motion is timely, comprehensive and deserves the full support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I issued a statement about the threat posed by Sellafield a week ago. When I made that statement I had not seen a copy of a report prepared for the Committee of Petitions of the European Parliament, the so-called STOA Project Report, which gives even more cause for alarm. The Committee of Petitions undertook its study of Sella<Col N="1578" /> field and of another reprocessing installation in Cap La Hague in France following concerns about these installations expressed to the committee by Dr. W. Nachtwey.</P>
    <P>The committee investigated Dr. Nachtwey's petition over a six-year period and reached several alarming conclusions. In particular, the committee concluded that the UK and France have not complied with Article 34 of the EURATOM Treaty which grants control rights to the European Commission for the verification of operation and efficiency of monitoring equipment at nuclear facilities. The UK and France have never requested the European Commission's opinion under Article 34 concerning any of their activities at Sellafield and Cap La Hague.</P>
    <P>Another conclusion was that the European Commission spends little by way of manpower resources on the evaluation of nuclear projects. It has expended two person months on the evaluation of reprocessing plants, which is a scandal.</P>
    <P>The OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, to which the European Commission is a contracting party, is of particular relevance to reprocessing activities such as are carried out at Sellafield. Increased releases of key radionuclides from Sellafield in the late 1990s and expected future discharges are inconsistent with obligations under the OSPAR Convention.</P>
    <P>The hazard potential of liquid high-level wastes from Sellafield is very high. A serious accident might lead to large releases of radioactivity and in the long-term to over one million fatal cancer cases globally, which is a frightening statistic. The conclusion of this significant report states the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at Sellafield and Cap La Hague leads to the largest man-made releases of radioactivity into the environment worldwide. Accidental releases from Sellafield and Cap La Hague could be two orders of magnitude larger than in the case of the Chernobyl disaster, which was referred to earlier, and could lead globally over the long-term in both cases to over 1 million fatal cancers. Those are significant scientific facts in a very comprehensive report and I hope they can be taken as a basis by the Government in initiating legal action to deal with this.</P>
    <P>It is not intended in disseminating these facts and opinions to alarm people on the dangers which Sellafield represents, as people are already acutely aware of it. Several people in my constituency, which is inland, have spoken to me recently of their concerns about Sellafield but it is essential that responsible public representatives, and even more so the Government of the day, should address these issues and take the actions necessary to allay public concern and to have these facilities brought under control and closed. In that regard, it is regrettable that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have decided to divide this House on an issue which should have the support of every Member.</P>
    <P>We should be fully aware of the hazards that <Col N="1579" /> Sellafield represents to Ireland, not just to the east coast but to the whole country, which I am sure the Minister of State recognises.. As someone closely associated with the farming community I know that an incident at Sellafield has the capacity to devastate Irish agriculture and lay waste thousands of working farms. One only needs to look at the wasteland that surrounds the Chernobyl nuclear facility to imagine the destruction to our environment and agricultural economy that Sellafield could cause.</P>
    <P>Our motion is not divisive and does not seek to score political points, despite what other speakers have said. It rightly highlights the inertia that has characterised this Government's so-called campaign against Sellafield and, most importantly, outlines a ten point action plan that would harness our legal, diplomatic and political campaign against Sellafield. It is a multipronged approach and should be welcomed as such.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that the European Commission should take seriously its responsibility in this area. Its activities and role in, say, the area of competition are as nothing compared to the importance of the threat represented by nuclear reprocessing. That two of the larger member states, France and Britain, are remiss in addressing their responsibilities in this area should not deter the Commission from confronting the issues involved here.</P>
    <P>I urge the European Commission to start, even if belatedly, to assume its responsibilities for this situation. It might start applying resources to bringing its knowledge of this situation up to date as a precursor to taking firm action to protect all the peoples of the European Union, irrespective of whatever vested interests have to be tackled in following that through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has put down this motion for the House out of a genuine concern which many inside and outside this House feel about the threat that the nuclear re-processing plant at Sellafield presents to the health and safety of people in Ireland and in England, and to all the peoples of the European Union.</P>
      <P>There has been widespread public comment on this issue within the past week or two arising from the final report of the Committee of Petitions of the European Parliament on the Nuclear Reprocessing Plants at Sellafield and at La Hague in France. This alarming report reinforces the views which the Labour Party has held consistently over the years where Sellafield is concerned. Those views might best be encapsulated in the idea that Sellafield is unsafe at any speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Years ago what we now know as Sellafield was known as Windscale. When it was Windscale there was a serious nuclear accident on the site which was known at the time and has been referred to subsequently as the Windscale incident. When the reputation of Windscale had declined over time to notoriety because of failures or inadequacies of control with multiple inci<Col N="1580" /> dents, it was thought best by the British to change the name of the plant to Sellafield. However, the failures, the inadequacies and the incidents have continued, despite the protestations to the contrary of BNFL or its claim that the authors of the Committee of Petition's report are biased.</P>
    <P>The media has picked up on the nightmare scenario which would follow if an aeroplane were to accidentally or deliberately impact the storage tanks in Sellafield. That would precipitate a disaster, but the greater danger derives from an accident or explosion taking place at Sellafield due to human error.</P>
    <P>Over the years BNFL has claimed that Sellafield is safe. Sellafield was built by human beings and is subject to the flaws and failings that characterise every human activity. To say that Sellafield is safe is like saying that to drive from Dublin to Athy is safe. Notwithstanding years of road safety campaigns, there are still horrifying accidents on our roads every day. Sellafield is, likewise, subject to human failings, be they design or technical flaws, errors of judgment, errors due to fatigue, etc. While an accident arising from human error by someone driving to Athy could be serious, however, a serious accident such as an explosion at Sellafield could have catastrophic consequences which could prevail for years and affect huge numbers of innocent victims. That is the feature of Sellafield which strikes terror among the people at large.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which disturbs people about Sellafield is the insensitivity of successive British Governments to Irish feelings about the nuclear reprocessing plant and the danger it represents as viewed from this side of the Irish Sea. This matter should be addressed urgently by the Government as a major Anglo-Irish issue which can and should be dealt with between neighbouring countries who are both member states of the European Union. Surely one of the advantages of our membership of the EU is the regular contact which takes place at intergovernmental level? Can the Government, in the context of this contact, not convince our British colleagues of how seriously this situation is viewed by people in Ireland and that action needs to be taken to address our concerns?</P>
    <P>Reprocessing plants such as those at Sellafield and La Hague should be closed. I also want to see the other nuclear power plants in the UK and in the other member states brought under much tighter European control and inspection.</P>
    <P>It is shocking to discover from the Committee of Petition's report on Sellafield that the European Commission, which has statutory responsibility under the EURATOM Treaty and is a legal contracting party to the OSPAR Convention, has been utterly deficient in discharging its responsibility where reprocessing plants are concerned.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the European Parliament and, specifically, its Committee on Petitions for highlighting the shortcomings in this area. I urge them to carry through on this and ensure that sufficient resources are put in place by the European Com<Col N="1581" /> mission to guarantee the protection of Europe's peoples against nuclear discharges or accidents at Sellafield. The Parliament cannot impose on the Commission by way of a directive, but it can, in the context of approving the European Union budget, insist on budgetary provision being made by the Commission which will require the Commission to deal adequately with its responsibility in this nuclear reprocessing area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really astonished at this debate tonight. For starters, I am astonished at my good friend and colleague, Deputy McGahon, agreeing with Sinn Féin and at Sinn Féin agreeing with him. I am just wondering whether Deputy McGahon will stand again at the next election. Perhaps there might be a message in this debate tonight, but I wish him well anyway. However, when I see Fine Gael and Sinn Féin agreeing on a Labour Party motion, then I know the Labour Party is right. I thank my colleague, Deputy McGahon, for his support and I thank the Sinn Féin Deputy also.</P>
      <P>What will the Independent Deputies do? Deputy Fox supported the text of the Labour Party motion, yet she will go through the lobbies and vote against it. I cannot understand that kind of hypocrisy. Why will the Independent Deputies, who agree with the Labour Party motion, not come in and vote with the Labour Party behind my party leader and our spokesperson? It is the height of hypocrisy. There are four Independent Deputies who can put the Labour Party motion in this House on the record in the interests of the Irish people, but they will not do that because they will sell their souls again and the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, will agree with that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has done his bit on this issue, but he has been left way out at sea on this matter. He has done his best and he will do his best in the future. He is a sincere Wicklow man who has the same problems which I have in County Louth, but he realises that he is really up against it.</P>
      <P>I would have to say to my colleagues here, as members of the European socialist group, that the British Prime Minister Mr. Blair has let us down very badly. This House should give him a message collectively, that the Irish Labour Party will not support the British Labour Party in what it proposes. We will demonstrate that, nationally and internationally, led by our party leader and deputy leader. We will not accept that the actions of a Labour Party, a member of the socialist group, pose a really serious problem not only for the people of the east coast but for all the people of Ireland. We will not accept that Prime Minister Mr. Blair goes around the world looking for a coalition against terrorism and at the same time poses the biggest possible problem to the security of this Republic, and we will not support him in doing so. We should tell Mr. Blair now that the Labour Party will not support him internationally if he continues to endanger the lives of the people of this Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The events of 11 September and the decision of BNFL to announce the expansion of its nuclear reprocessing facility have coincided to remind us of the sheer arrogance and indifference of that company to the legitimate concerns of the population of this country. BNFL cannot be trusted because of the long litany of mishaps, incidents and accidents over many years. Reassurances have been given many times which have almost always turned out to be ill-founded.</P>
      <P>The ALARA principle &ndash; as low as reasonably achievable &ndash; is the underlying principle that guides the use of nuclear material. Any exposure to radiation should be balanced by the potential advantage to the public. X-rays are a very good example of the use of radiation where there is an overall benefit to the patient. BNFL and its expansion of Sellafield are clearly designed to benefit some of the British public and the British economy, but the legitimate concerns of the population of this island are arrogantly ignored. It has always been a clear argument that Sellafield brings no benefit whatsoever to Ireland. Conversely, it causes pollution of the Irish Sea and considerable stress for many people who worry about the consequences of that pollution.</P>
      <P>The inaction of the Government over the past four years is the greatest indictment of its commitment to real action on Sellafield, which has been allowed to flourish without a whimper from the Government until the recent MOX plant became a public scandal. Only then did we hear any response or see significant effort from the Government. BNFL is concerned with making money, not with the health of its neighbours or protecting the environment. For years it has been repeated that the biggest threat from Sellafield is the risk of a major nuclear accident.</P>
      <P>BNFL does not seem to understand the normal conventions of being good neighbours, nor does it care about any damage that might result from its indifferent approach to discharges into the environment. BNFL responds only to pressure and the pressure from the Government was allowed drop to the point where it was undetectable. It is now much more difficult to force a row-back, when the MOX plant has been given the green light by the British Government. The UK Government is not doing us any favours in allowing the MOX plant to go ahead.</P>
      <P>There is a tangible fear expressed by the public about the consequences of a nuclear accident or incident, or terrorist attack. If these fears were not soundly based, then none of us would be fighting to have Sellafield closed. Promises about action that might or could be taken will not satisfy the public. It wants to know the details of the plan, the timeframe on the plan of action, who will be engaged to progress it, what kind of expertise, legal and scientific, will be needed to implement it. In other words, it is no longer adequate to give vague comforting promises that something will be done sometime in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sanctioning of the scale-up of the MOX plant within weeks of the terrorist attack in New <Col N="1583" /> York is about as insensitive as one could imagine. Whether the consequences of a terrorist attack on Sellafield would be as serious as predicted by some commentators is irrelevant. The perception of a doomsday scenario through a terrorist attack, combined with a genuine fear of the consequences of radioactivity, serve to frighten an already mistrusting public. It should not be forgotten in our concern for the consequences of an accident at Sellafield that there are many other nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom that, if attacked or they were the centre of an accident, could produce a very damaging result for Ireland. The ageing reactors in Wales, close to our coastline, should not be overlooked in our concerns with the high profile now focused on Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Sellafield, or any of the other nuclear installations in the United Kingdom, offers no advantage to Ireland. It is all pain and no gain for Ireland from these installations. Why should we, in this country, carry the negative consequences of these installations, when we stand to gain absolutely nothing from them? We cannot trust the information fed to us for years by BNFL. We are not allowed to have any significant role in independent monitoring or inspections of the plants. BNFL conveniently hides behind the shield of confidentiality when requested to allow access to the plant by an independent inspectorate. On the basis that any information is better than none we acquiesce, accept and settle for a limited inspection of documentation. We all know that this is not telling anything like the full story, but it is the best offer available.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government should no longer stand for being fobbed off like this. The Labour Party has set out a clear ten point plan which, if implemented, would give the Irish public some reason to have confidence in our ability to defend our environment, tourism industry, fishing industry, the health and safety of our animal population and, most importantly, the health and safety of our people, from the consequences of radioactivity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, I represent County Wicklow, a beautiful county with an extensive coastline. It is also vulnerable. Living on the east coast inevitably means living close to Sellafield, which has been a malevolent and threatening presence in our lives for decades. The initiative to link the local authorities around the Irish Sea was sponsored originally by Bray Urban District Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the years the history of accidental discharges and deliberate cover-ups has served to deepen our anxiety. When the rainbow Government took office the anxieties expressed by people in County Wicklow and other areas were finally heeded. The Government set about the mammoth task of challenging Sellafield and seeking its closure. We all understood this was a project of great ambition and scope, but the fact the work had begun gave us all some comfort. The <Col N="1584" /> record of that ministerial group showed we were right to hope. The changes in the international marine framework came about as a result of the work of those Ministers. The then Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, in particular, must be acknowledged for his effectiveness in blocking the development of the major underground dump at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The record of this Government, by comparison, is cause not for reassurance, but for alarm. I have the highest regard for my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and his sincerity, but he is in an impossible position. Because the ministerial group was disbanded when the Government took office, the Taoiseach and his Cabinet failed to keep up the necessary pressure on the British Government. As a result, the British Government has felt free to play havoc with our security, not just in County Wicklow, but in Ireland. The decision, and its timing, to proceed with the MOX plant show how badly the situation has deteriorated. At a time when we have seen the horrific effects of global terrorism, the decision by the British Government is both irresponsible and dangerous. Even without the MOX development, Sellafield constitutes an obvious target for terrorists. If it was attacked by an aircraft, a level of radioactivity could be created which would be 40 times greater than that of the Chernobyl disaster, and result in tens of thousands of cancer deaths in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The recent EU report highlights the true nature of the threat to people and the environment. It points out that the release of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea and the atmosphere is largely unnecessary, yet we have been forced to live with the reality that this sea is the most radioactive in the world. More importantly, it points out the extraordinary threat posed by the volumes of high level radioactive waste in liquid form currently stored in tanks at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate. It reflects the concerns of the people in my constituency which are being expressed to me on a daily basis. The Labour Party is committed to ensuring the record of BNFL is exposed, but also that the challenge to close Sellafield is taken up. We welcome the recent EU report which highlights the extent of the hazards in close proximity to our shores. It has helped concentrate minds and forced the Government to cobble together a response, which, even if tardy, is still welcome. The motion being presented by the Labour Party goes much further than anything the Government has managed to do. It sets out a strategy, spelling out what must be done to counteract the potential nuclear catastrophe inherent at Sellafield. I urge the Government to support it. We all understand the challenge is immense. What is needed is an integrated approach which adopts the various elements spelled out in the motion, both on the legal front and the diplomatic front. It should also be addressed in the context of the famous relationship we are supposed to have through the Taoiseach with Tony Blair. If we do not adopt <Col N="1585" /> this strategy, there is very little chance we will see significant improvement in terms of the safety we are entitled to enjoy and which is being badly affected by developments in a country close by.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, gave quite a comprehensive response to this timely motion proposed by Deputy Stagg in the name of the Labour Party. I watched his speech with growing horror. He painted a nightmare scenario that would frighten most citizens had they heard it, and I have no doubt he was entirely justified in spelling out the full horror of living so near to this monstrous hazard. What struck me about the Minister's speech was that, having described the danger, he offered no conviction that his Government will do anything effective to deal with an issue that so concerns the people of this country and not just those resident in the east coast.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, spelled out the well known lamentable record of Sellafield concerning safety management and safety standards. He went on to explain that the severely critical report of the UK inspectorate which in February 2000 made 28 recommendations has, 18 months later, largely been ignored by BNFL.</P>
      <P>The Minister last night confirmed that the nuclear spent fuel reprocessing industry is now separating more plutonium than the nuclear industry is able to absorb. The result is that Sellafield now has a stockpile of plutonium which presents a potential risk to existing and future generations. He explains why the Government has been concerned about the risks associated with the storage of high-level liquid waste in tanks at Sellafield. He seems to say that despite assurances from the UK authorities concerning vitrification of the waste the response has been poor. No matter what lengths the Minister of State goes to in order to explain what he has done over the past five years, it is plain his efforts have been entirely ineffectual. The latest devastating proof of that conclusion is the alarming announcement by the UK Government that it has given the go ahead for the MOX plant. This announcement betrays how very little regard the UK Government has for the protestations of the Irish Government and only adds insult to injury. In the wake of 11 September it is a breathtaking decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prime Minister Blair seems to have an ambition to emulate some of his great wartime predecessors as he sees it. If we are to believe his rhetoric, it is not unreasonable to conclude that Sellafield might become a terrorist target. The Minister of State admitted as much last night. The consequences of this for the British and Irish people would be unthinkable. Can measures be put in place to secure Sellafield against terrorist attack? I do not believe there is any such thing as absolute security and most thinking citizens will conclude that if we have been consistently lied to <Col N="1586" /> about safety standards, it is probable we are being lied to about security standards.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the recent report that the Sellafield plant, together with its counterpart in France, in the course of their ordinary day-to-day operations spews out an amount of radiation equivalent to a large nuclear accident is horrifying. The consequences of a major accident at the Sellafield site is, I am convinced, a preoccupation of Irish people and the spectre of a terrorist attack is unthinkable. My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, detailed last night what might happen in these circumstances. One even has reservations about repeating such a scenario. It is clear, however, that the Minister of State does not take serious issue with the description and, in any event, the Minister concludes that the commissioning of the MOX plant increases the risk of accident. He tells us in the wake of the MOX decision that he wrote to the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Health and the Taoiseach personally contacted Prime Minister Blair.</P>
    <P>It is true that no one in the UK Administration paid too much attention to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob's, letters. I do not blame him. It is obvious the Irish Government has left him to carry the can. A junior Minister does not carry the clout necessary to reflect the deep concerns of the Irish people. The web of public relations advisers and spin doctors who follow the Taoiseach around let it be known from time to time that he has a great personal relationship with Tony Blair. Tony Blair probably does not know that the Taoiseach, of course, has a great personal relationship with everyone. The test of his special relationship with the British Prime Minister is whether he can reverse the contempt shown by the UK Government for the genuine fears of the Irish people. Dusting down his annual speech to the Fianna Fáil Ard Fhéis obviously carries very little weight with Tony Blair.</P>
    <P>I understand an initiative under the Law of the Sea is now contemplated by the Irish Government, which I welcome. However, of itself, it seems an entirely inadequate response. If we examine the Minister of State's seven point summary last night of the concerns of the Irish, with which I agree, only one, that is, the discharge of radioactive materials into the Irish Sea seems relevant to such an initiative. I ask the Minister of State to take on board the plan sketched out by Deputy Stagg in proposing this motion.</P>

    <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on one of the most serious matters to come before us in recent years. Coming from a coastal community on the Hook Peninsula in County Wexford, I understand the serious concerns expressed over the last two nights by my colleagues. Given that I share a constituency in <Col N="1587" /> Wexford with Deputy Howlin, he and I heard quite a lot about this particular aspect at meetings, particularly in recent weeks.

The Sellafield MOX plant is one of the main issues of discussion at the committee in recent months and will remain a priority until it is closed.

      <P>I recall some time ago travelling to Sellafield at my own expense to see what went on there. I am quite satisfied with what has been said here that, of course, the MOX plant should not be commissioned. Deputy Howlin in particular will be aware &ndash; I got very little support on the issue &ndash; that I was greatly concerned about the transporting of fuel to Sellafield through the Irish Sea. When I mentioned that ships used to travel <Col N="1588" /> through the Irish Sea, which was sometimes very busy with submarine traffic, some people thought it a sort of skit. Now the chickens are coming home to roost and people are beginning to see the dangers. I agree with what has been said. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is working as hard as he can. If we support him rather than ridicule him, and be serious about the issue, we might go the distance.</P>
      <P>As everyone here will know, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, comes from the bordering constituency of Wicklow. One can hear the fun going on over on the benches opposite and I wonder how serious is the Labour Party about this issue.</P>

      <P>The legal action under the OSPAR Convention, which the Government is taking against the UK in regard to the MOX plant, is an indication of its determination to prevent this plant from proceeding. The Government can see no justification for this plant. This is the first time legal action has ever been taken by any Government against Sellafield. A decision on the possible legal action under EU and UN law, in addition to the OSPAR legal action already well under way, will be taken by the Government in the next few days. The Government knows where it is going in relation to the MOX plant &ndash; it wants the UK decision reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the report commissioned by the STOA committee of the European Parliament to which a number of Deputies referred and which <Col N="1589" /> has also received coverage in the media. I understand this report is not yet in the public domain. I am aware that the Department of Public Enterprise has been endeavouring to obtain a copy of the report ahead of its publication, and I understand the Department has now received a copy of the report and, in conjunction with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, is examining it. The renewed interest by the European Parliament in nuclear affairs, and in particular the radiological impact of the Sellafield and La Hague nuclear reprocessing facilities, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The danger of a terrorist attack on Sellafield is a matter of real concern. At the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency last month, Ireland actively supported a draft resolution which recognised the need to continue to devote attention to the potential implications of terrorist attacks for the physical protection of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities. The resolution adopted by the General Conference requested the director general of the agency to strengthen the agency's work relevant to preventing acts of terrorism involving nuclear materials and other radiological materials.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government is doing everything in its power in regard to the Sellafield issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has already outlined to the House details of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. The national emergency plan, which is currently in the public domain, dates back to 1992. The plan has been undergoing review over the past two years and an updated plan will be ready for publication towards the end of the year. A summary of the updated plan will be circulated to every household in the near future. In the meantime, recognising that there is a public need for information and counter measures in the event of an accident, the Department of Public Enterprise will place advertisements in the national and provincial press giving essential advice on these counter measures which is simple, practical and effective.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to pursue all realistic and effective courses of action, legal and otherwise, to bring about the closure of Sellafield. The tragic events of 11 September have added a new dimension to this objective. The task is not easy, but we will not be found wanting. We can achieve our objectives through a combination of legal action and, where appropriate, diplomatic action. We have been successful previously in harnessing the support of other countries with similar concerns about reprocessing facilities and will continue to foster our relationships with like-minded countries towards this end.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult situation and I know Deputy Stagg, and previously Deputy Gilmore, put a great deal of effort into this question. It will be difficult to get results, but the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is doing everything he can to ensure we make progress on this issue.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my 15 minutes with Deputies Quinn and Stagg. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is leaving the Chamber but I will begin my contribution by referring to him because the opening comment in his contribution was that this was one of the most important issues to come before this House in recent times. If that is true, and I believe it to be true, it is extraordinary that no senior Minister spoke in this debate. No senior Minister even came into the Chamber to sit in support of the Minister of State in charge of this issue. If this is the most important issue or among the most important issues facing this House, what sense of urgency or importance is attached to it by a Government which does not even require a senior Minister to attend for this debate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government did not attend.</P>
      <P>Although we all salute efforts made by people like the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, that effort has been futile, pointless and a failure. It cannot be glossed up in any other terms because we have nothing to show for four and a half years of this Administration. I get annoyed when I hear people preaching, either from the Fine Gael back benches or the Sinn Féin seat behind me, for consensus on this issue and that we should rally to an ineffectual cause. The Labour Party is united in the view that we will no longer tolerate a second rate effort that has resulted not only in there being no diminution of the dangers inherent in the Sellafield plant but a significant worsening of the situation with the bringing on-stream of the MOX plant. That is in stark contrast to the record of the previous Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Administration, on my initiative, set up a Cabinet sub-committee of Ministers that I had the honour and privilege to chair. We took our business seriously and in two and a half years, we not only gathered a huge volume of scientific data and legal expertise but succeeded, for the first time in 40 years, in halting the advance of the dangers of Sellafield when the NIREX proposal to build an underground nuclear waste storage facility at Cumbria was stopped. It was not stopped by a Minister of State writing letters. It was stopped by direct intervention by me at the European Environment Council at every single meeting by tabling it as an agenda item at the Council and raising it at the broader European Environment Forum to such an extent that at one meeting I got a personal note from John Gummer, Secretary of State, asking if we could take it as read for that one Council that the Irish Government is vehemently opposed to Sellafield. It was stopped because the then Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, went to give evidence at the planning inquiry in Cumbria and a co-ordinated con<Col N="1591" /> certed effort was made that had, for the first time in 40 years, tangible results.</P>
    <P>All the work of that two and a half years was undone by a decision to dismember that ministerial committee. According to the reply to a parliamentary question, a new committee was established several months later, no longer chaired by a member of the Cabinet but by a Minister of State. That is not a serious continuity of effort, and mealy-mouthed words will not justify the inaction and failure of the past four and a half years. It is time we decided to join our forces to do everything we can, legally, to confront the greatest potential hazard this country has ever faced. That can only be done through a united approach by this House behind the solid message of the Labour Party motion. I appeal to the Minister of State to withdraw the Government amendment before he divides the House.</P>

It was particularly disturbing then, but not surprising, sadly, to read in our newspapers this morning that, notwithstanding the Minister of State's ignorance of the situation, the decisions had already been taken at a Cabinet meeting that day and would be steered through by a Cabinet sub-committee, also established yesterday and of which the Minister of State failed to inform the House last evening.</P>

      <P>The Government is already well known for its desire to inform the media of information it withholds from the House, but it is unusual to withhold information from its own <Col N="1592" /> members. We are left with a Minister of State who is responsible for the campaign against Sellafield, but out of the limited loop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State would be rightly annoyed at being ignored. The Government's campaign against Sellafield has mirrored the Taoiseach's leadership on other issues. When confronted with problems, he has been slow to act. Rather than take decisions, he has sat and watched other Ministers wither on the vine. The experience of Ray Burke and Ned O'Keeffe springs to mind.</P>
      <P>The Government has fought against Sellafield as hard as it fought for Aer Lingus &ndash; not at all. Since coming to office, it has been devoid of drive and energy. The campaign against Sellafield falters, the national development plan falls behind schedule and Aer Lingus goes to the wall. Meanwhile the captain of the ship is having his photo taken elsewhere. That is what has passed for leadership in this country in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party motion before the House this evening sets out an action plan to carry the fight against Sellafield into the international arena. The Government's amendment, now seemingly out of date, is a recipe for inaction. The Government is now establishing a Cabinet sub-committee, four and a half years after abandoning the last one. If the Taoiseach wishes to undermine his Minister of State, he could do no better job than he did yesterday. If he wishes to remove him from his post, then he should have the courage to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all contributors to this debate, from all sides of the House. I am amazed and deeply disappointed at the negative and minimalist attitude of the Government to our very constructive motion and the whole issue of Sellafield, which has been described as a disaster waiting to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate there were many knowledgeable contributions. We heard of iodine 129, carbon 14, strontium 90, cobalt 60, technetium 99 and plutonium, the raw material for atomic bombs. We also heard of the 21 tanks of highly active liquid waste at Sellafield. While it is important to have knowledge of the scientific basis of what we are dealing with, it is also important to speak of this awful threat in a manner that will be understood by the ordinary citi<Col N="1593" /> zen. All of the chemical substances I mentioned are radioactive. They are discharged from and stored in Sellafield. Radioactive substances destroy human flesh and bones. In large doses, they kill quickly and, in smaller doses, cause a variety of cancers that lead to a slow lingering death.</P>
    <P>What would be the effect on Ireland if these substances were to be released into the atmosphere, either through terrorist attack or an accident at the plant? The reality needs to be spelled out. A colossal cloud of radioactive material would rise over Cumbria, less than 100 miles from Dublin and the east coast of Ireland. It would drift at the speed of the prevailing wind away from the site. There is a 30% chance that it would drift directly towards Dublin and spread out to cover a wider area. The slower the wind, the wider the spread. Nuclear fall-out would have contaminated or killed people in the immediate vicinity of the site and, as it progressed, would contaminate the sea and everything in it. Dublin would be hit within hours after disaster had struck Cumbria.</P>
    <P>It would be virtually impossible to escape contamination. Hundreds of thousands of people would be immediately affected, some of whom would die quickly while many thousands would die a slow and lingering death from a variety of cancers. The deadly cloud of radioactivity would continue across Ireland, carried by the wind, whether north, south or west at the time. Bally-</P>
    <P>bunion would be as vulnerable as Ballymun. It would lay a lethal trail of death for men, women and children, rich and poor. It would contaminate the earth, the grass, hillsides and valleys and no animal would be safe. The deadly radioactive contamination would last for thousands of years. <Col N="1594" /> In the case of one variety it would remain active for at least 250,000 years.</P>
    <P>For the survivors of this disaster, which can be avoided, there would be a grim future. Irish agriculture would be devastated. Our produce would not be fit for human consumption for centuries. Europe's greatest agricultural nation would be reduced to a wasteland. Irish tourism would be destroyed. Apart from the occasional UN nuclear inspection team, no one in their right mind would come to our shores. In short, our economy would collapse, and there would be a mass exodus from the island. All the iodine tablets, nationwide leaflets and shelters provided by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, would make no difference at all. For those contaminated by radioactive fall-out and who survive, the future would be grim. Future generations would be born with a variety of malformations and disabilities. Anyone who doubts this need only look at the health statistics for those who survived Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>To remove this real threat to present and future generations in Ireland must be our priority. The operations at Sellafield are uneconomic and unnecessary. The plant is in breach of international law and flies in the face of common sense and logic. Why would mankind promote such a doomsday scenario for its own kind? We must resolve, therefore, to close down this deadly threat to our very existence as a nation and people. That must be our first priority. We must use every diplomatic, legal, political and economic tool available, on a permanent and relentless basis, until we are successful. We cannot rest until this threat is removed. I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving Deputy Penrose and me the opportunity to raise this important matter.</P>
      <P>On Monday of this week a number of other public representatives and I attended a meeting organised by the Westmeath Centre for Independent Living. It was pointed out to us that leaders in that group are about to lose their personal assistants for a period of seven weeks over the Christmas period. I can best describe the disappointment of this group by reading a letter from someone about their life. I do not use the real name as it would identify the person, but Members will find it of interest. She writes:</P>
      <P>My name is Patricia. I have multiple sclerosis. I am due to go into hospital on 8 November for a hysterectomy. The recovery period for a healthy individual is from three to six months. There is the possibility that this operation will have a negative effect on my MS as it is a shock to the system. I have a personal assistant that helps me to live an independent life, for example, to work, to do my own shopping. She makes up for numerous shortfalls that occur due to my illness. She is my trusted friend. I could not be the wife and mother that I am if I did not have her in my life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS has decided that it will close down the service of personal assistants in November for a period of seven weeks, which extends over the Christmas period and into January 2002. If I were to lose my PA there would be no Christmas in my home. Who would do the cooking and the decorating and the shopping and all the things that are taken for granted at Christmas? I would have trouble achieving this on my own with the MS, but trying to do it with this operation is not possible. I am not the worst case scenario. I know many others who are worse off than I am. They have been told that they too will lose their PA for seven <Col N="1597" /> weeks. This is a ridiculous situation. Why does someone have the right to tell me that I can have the independence that I need to live a productive and meaningful life and then turn on a whim and tell me that they have the right to take that independence away?</P>
    <P>The day of internment for the disabled in this country is past and yet a Government-funded operation is given permission to subject the disabled to the degrading position of having to beg for enough resources to see them through Christmas. It has taken me approximately three hours just to put this letter together. How much time are you going to spend on the problem?</P>
    <P>That outlines what is happening. Will the Minister of State please ensure that this lady and others like her have permanent PAs and do not have to put up with these ridiculous circumstances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter with him tonight. We wish to focus on circumstances at the centres for independent living. They are highly dependent upon the help of personal assistants provided under the auspices of the community employment scheme funded and operated under the aegis of FÁS. The Centre for Independent Living at Kinnegad, described by Deputy McGrath, and with which the Deputy and I are especially familiar, is an excellent facility for those with varying degrees of disability. At this critical juncture in the year, facing into Christmas and beyond, personal assistants are being taken out of the equation due to the ending of the FÁS scheme for seven to eight weeks from 23 November to 7 January 2002. This leaves the leaders and participants without personal assistants at a most vulnerable time and leaves these personal assistants and their supervisors unemployed over the eight-week period. While everyone pays lip service by saying that the service for disabled persons under the community employment scheme is classed as a priority, what astounds me and the CIL in Kinnegad is that there is no extension in the eligibility criteria for persons who are personal assistants in the CE scheme. They should be allowed to continue in the role uninterrupted throughout the year without being subjected to any break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This important service is one of those which was to be mainstreamed. It was discussed with the Department of Health and Children. Hopefully, the personal assistant service will be placed on a more secure footing whereby they will not be dependent on the whims of various schemes. If this process is under way why not permit FÁS to introduce the necessary flexibility in the intervening period to permit the current CE scheme to continue without a break? I have learned that the provision of PAs for the centres for independent living is not to be flexible. In Kinnegad 14 eligible leaders are paired with personal assistants and they need full and continual funding. They are negotiating with the Midland Health Board, <Col N="1598" /> which has indicated that it might consider providing funding to bridge the gap this year. However, that might well be taken out of the 2002 health board allocation, reducing the level of service for next year.</P>
    <P>This is the second year this problem has arisen for these vulnerable people and we should all remember that it is quite difficult for the sponsoring bodies of the centres for independent living to recruit the people to satisfy the strict eligibility criteria laid down by FÁS for participants. Recently, along with other colleagues, including Deputy McGrath, I attended a meeting at the CIL in Kinnegad and heard at first hand their deep concerns at these developments. One lady with multiple sclerosis told us that she would lose her PA and that Christmas would not happen for her. Other heart-rending stories related compel one to the view that a properly structured, well-developed and continuously funded scheme for the provision of personal assistants for these centres is the only way forward. From the perspective of a cost-benefit analysis it saves the State millions of pounds as otherwise these people might have to resort to institutional care. Their case is well made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGrath and Penrose for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of community employment as an active labour market programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. CE provides unemployed people with temporary opportunities whereby they can develop their skills and obtain a track record of work experience. The scheme is being restructured, following Government approval in 1999, to take account of falling unemployment levels and to better target available places at older long-term unemployed persons. As part of this process a decision was taken, in consultation with the social partners, to gradually reduce the numbers employed on CE from an average of 37,500 in 1999 to 28,000 by 2003. The restructuring of CE is part of an overall shift in strategic policy in favour of greater investment in training places, particularly for persons under 25 and the long-term unemployed. In line with a commitment in the PPF and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on CE are being mainstreamed. &ldquo;Mainstreaming&rdquo; in the context of CE is the term used to describe the proposed transfer of funding and the provision of services to the relevant Department with direct responsibility for the area concerned. Mainstreaming will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mainstreaming of schools services is currently under way and discussions with the Department of Health and Children on the mainstreaming of CE health services are proceeding. Tonight's question refers to health services, the <Col N="1599" /> mainstreaming of which will involve the transfer of CE funding from FÁS to the Department of Health and Children. That should place services such as the provision of personal assistants on a more secure footing. Services provided under CE for disabled persons are classified as a priority by FÁS and have been protected from the phased reductions imposed on other categories of projects after the restructuring of the programme in 1999. Audits of CE schemes undertaken in 1999, 2000 and 2001 showed an increase in the number of CE participants providing these services.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the short-term nature of participation on CE is not compatible with the needs of persons with disabilities. The proposed mainstreaming has positive implications for the provision of these services in the future by creating more permanent funding conditions for their delivery. The Department of Health and Children, which has primary responsibility for funding in this area, is supportive of the proposal in principle and the two Departments, in consultation with FÁS, are now looking at the modalities involved. I hope that these discussions can be completed as soon as possible enabling the proposed new funding arrangements to be put in place by the Department of Health and Children at an early date. Discussions with the Department of the Environment and Local Government have also been initiated recently by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the possibility of mainstreaming certain environmental services currently provided under CE. These discussions are at an early stage and will progress as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>While there are certain immediate difficulties with regard to the implementation of mainstreaming, I consider the outcome to be very worthwhile in the long-term. The areas in question stand to benefit significantly from an assured source of long-term funding which should facilitate better planning and provision of services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember my childhood days when the train ran from Dublin to Navan to Kells and from Virginia Road station to Oldcastle. Unfortunately, in the late 1950s or 1960s, that ceased. One could also have taken a train from Navan to Kingscourt via Kilberry, Wilkinstown, Castletown, Navan, Nobber, and Kilmainham Wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passenger lines to Kingscourt closed in 1947. Freight trains have continued to use the line, mainly to transport gypsum. There have been regular trains from Kingscourt, both to the Irish Cement factories at Platin outside Drogheda and Castlemongret in County Limerick. Partly as a result of the ILDA dispute, the traffic to Platin switched to road. Iarnród Éireann has decided that the line from Navan to Kingscourt is to close because of high maintenance costs. It is ironic <Col N="1600" /> given that the programme of bridge renewal on the line has been ongoing since the beginning of 2000.</P>
    <P>Closing this line will lead to 30 or 40 extra lorries using Meath roads travelling to Drogheda and County Limerick. These roads are already overburdened with traffic. They facilitate traffic going from the north and the north-west to Dublin and traffic from Dundalk going west. It is odd that Iarnród Éireann is closing the northern half of the original Clonsilla-Kingscourt railway when there are plans to reopen for passengers the now closed Navan-Clonsilla section by 2011.</P>
    <P>I understand that Iarnród Éireann is considering withdrawing from the freight rail business. The investment of recent years in our railways is only beginning to make up for the decades of under-investment. Industries should be encouraged to switch to rail through tax breaks and suitable subsidies. It was always intended that when passenger trains returned to Navan, the existing line to Kingscourt would reopen for passengers.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State not to make the mistake that was made concerning the line from Dublin to Oldcastle. When it ceased it the late 1950s or early 1960s, not only was the line closed but the land was sold back to the farmers. If that line had been left intact, a train could be running again from Dublin to Oldcastle. I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider this decision and do all in his power to keep the line open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue. I regret that a decision has been reached to cease the freight rail service from Navan to Kingscourt, County Cavan. Sadly, this will result in the closure of the last railway in County Cavan.</P>
      <P>The service conveyed gypsum from Kingscourt to the Irish Cement plants in Drogheda and Limerick. The ILDA strike resulted in a switch of freight from rail to road, and unfortunately it seems that this is to continue. Irish Cement's decision to transfer all freight to road will lead to more heavy vehicles further congesting our busy road network, as Deputy Johnny Brady has rightly stated.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that Iarnród Éireann is seriously considering withdrawing from the rail freight business. I hope this is not correct. We should provide incentives to ensure a greater use of the rail network in the conveyance of freight. This would obviously reduce congestion and the heavy vehicle burden on our road network. In recent years, Iarnród Éireann committed substantial expenditure in upgrading the rail line from Navan to Kingscourt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, is here tonight to listen to the case Deputy Brady and I have outlined. If the decision by Irish Cement to change the means of transport is irrevocable, will he give a firm commitment that the Department of Public Enterprise will instruct Iarnród Éireann <Col N="1601" /> to leave intact the existing line, which I hope will be developed in the longer term for passenger traffic?</P>
    <P>My Fianna Fáil colleagues in County Meath have actively sought the provision of a rail passenger service from Dublin to Navan. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I wholeheartedly support their efforts. I have consistently raised with the Minister the potential that exists to further develop such a passenger service to Kingscourt, which would be of immense benefit to that town and a large part of east Cavan. Similarly, Carrickmacross and south Monaghan would benefit. That rail line must remain <i>in situ</i>. With further economic development in this country, it will be of long-term value to our transport infrastructure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter. Rail freight services to and from particular locations fall within the day-to-day responsibility of Iarnród Éireann. Decisions by customers relating to rail freight contracts, as referred to by the Deputies, are a matter for direct negotiation between Iarnród Éireann and the customer. The Minister for Public Enterprise has no role in this area.</P>
      <P>As for rail services generally, the Deputies will be aware that the review group which reported to the Minister on 4 July last on &ldquo;Iarnród Éireann: The Way Forward&rdquo; indicated that there are major questions to be addressed with regard to the future of the rail freight business. The review group recommended that a special and thorough study of the issue be commissioned as a matter of urgency. It suggested that long range plans will need to be established for the rail sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister is anxious that there should be a strategic consideration of the contribution of rail services in the light of the emerging national spatial strategy and the £500 million investment programme set out in the national development plan. The future role of rail freight will be a key component of this long range review.</P>
      <P>The Iarnród Éireann review group made a number of arguments in favour of and against retaining freight services generally. At this stage, it would not be appropriate for the Minister to comment in detail on these arguments. The review to be undertaken within the Department will give comprehensive consideration to the issues raised by the review group and the forthcoming report to be made to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources by the task force on port logistics which will also deal with the subject of rail freight. The review will, therefore, have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to likely changes in freight transport, distribution, logistics and the particular contribution the rail system can make to goods distribution and the alleviation of road congestion.</P>
      <P>I assure my two colleagues that I will convey to the Minister the sincere points and proposals they made tonight.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment. It is another example of how our health services are failing our sick and how this Government seems to be totally oblivious to what is happening in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>Mary Quirke-McFarland from Listowel was diagnosed with lung cancer after being admitted to Tralee General Hospital where she works as a nurse, for tests on 10 September. She was referred to Cork University Hospital for a more detailed examination on 24 September. She had to wait a further ten days for a prognosis. She was then advised that the type of cancer she suffers from is operable and could be removed. She was scheduled for surgery at Cork University Hospital on 17 October to remove either a lobe of the affected lung or the entire organ.</P>
      <P>However, on 12 October, just five days before she was due to be admitted, Mrs Quirke-McFarland was advised that her operation had been cancelled because of the unavailability of beds in the intensive care unit. Her operation was rescheduled for this Tuesday, 23 October and she was assured that the operation would go ahead. On Monday morning, just as she was saying goodbye to her children and being driven to Cork by her husband, Peter, she received a telephone call from Cork University Hospital informing her that the operation was postponed again. Understandably, she was devastated.</P>
      <P>Eleven years ago when Mary lived in London her doctor discovered a lump in her breast. She was admitted to a hospital the following day and had it removed. Fortunately for her, it was at a pre-cancerous stage.</P>
      <P>The urgency with which her problem was dealt with in London contrasts with her treatment in Ireland. In September when the cancer was diagnosed, Mary was also warned that the lymph nodes in her chest were enlarged which indicated that the cancer was spreading throughout her body. Mary's health has rapidly deteriorated in the past two weeks as her breathing has become increasingly difficult and she has developed a cough. She is concerned about the future of her three children should anything happen to her.</P>
      <P>To be told not once but twice that no bed was available for her is unforgivable. This is no way to run a health service. The buck stops with the Minister. It is up to him to provide the necessary resources to the Southern Health Board to provide the required number of beds in the intensive care unit in Cork University Hospital so that urgent cases, such as Mary McFarland, can be dealt with. I understand Mrs. McFarland received further notification today that she will be admitted on Wednesday, 31 October. For her sake and that of her family, I hope the unacceptable delay in carrying out the required operation will not affect her chances of recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment experienced by Mary McFar<Col N="1603" /> land is unacceptable in a country which claims to look after its sick. This story was featured on the Gerry Ryan programme and was reported in <i>The Kerryman</i>. It is wrong that a woman felt that the only course open to her was to go public with her case to get justice and have the necessary treatment provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this issue on the Adjournment. As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of surgical services in Cork University Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board. I am advised by the Southern Health Board that the person mentioned was seen by a surgeon on 5 October last and was initially issued with a provisional appointment for surgery on 17 October, subject to confirmation. Unfortunately, it was not possible to arrange treatment for that date and the patient was scheduled to be admitted on Monday, 22 October last for a procedure to be carried out on 23 October for which a post-operative intensive therapy unit bed was deemed necessary. I am informed that, over the weekend, the hospital experienced a significant demand on its intensive care beds and, regrettably, due to clinical demand, an ITU post operative bed was not available for her and surgery could not proceed on that date.</P>
      <P>It is most regrettable that any patient's scheduled treatment should have to be postponed. It is a matter of particular concern that a patient in these circumstances should have an operation of this nature postponed. However, the Southern Health Board has indicated that the postponement was unfortunately unavoidable given the exceptional pressure placed on ICT facilities over the previous weekend. The board has informed me that the patient is scheduled to be operated on next Wednesday, 31 October, which is the next operating date of the surgeon who is treating her.</P>
      <P>It has been a concern of the Government in recent years to improve the quality of cancer services available nationally. In this context, since the commencement of the implementation of the national cancer strategy, £5.4 million of dedicated money has been allocated to the Southern Health Board specifically for the development of oncology and related services. This funding has enabled a range of developments under the national cancer strategy, including new consultant appointments in the Southern Health Board in the areas of oncology, histopathology and haematology. The board has also received approval for a consultant surgeon with a special interest in gastro-intestinal surgery and a consultant surgeon with a special interest in breast care.</P>
      <P>The pressures on the acute hospitals generally are of concern to the Government and, for that reason, we have examined the adequacy of bed capacity in the system. This is one of the issues to be dealt with in the forthcoming health strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation the Deputy has raised is unfortu<Col N="1604" /> nate and is obviously a cause of great concern to the Minister, Deputy Martin, to me and to the patient concerned. The Southern Health Board will be asked to address this issue as soon as possible.</P>

    <Title>Strategic Planning Guidelines.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I acknowledge the competence of the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, I regret the Minister for the Environment and Local Government could not be present. I believe he may have tried to side-step me on this important and pertinent issue.</P>
      <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area were published in March 1999 and set out an integrated land use and transportation framework for sustainable development in the greater Dublin area which encompasses Dublin city and county along with counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow. I will deal with one specific aspect of those guidelines which were incorporated into law as part of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The people who drew them up and certainly the politicians involved in drawing them up did not see them becoming law at the time.</P>
      <P>The guidelines identify both areas for growth and what is called the metropolitan area. With respect to Wicklow, the areas of Bray, Greystones and Delgany are within the metropolitan area. Outside that, Wicklow town is identified as a primary growth centre and Arklow as a secondary one. The guidelines state that growth in these areas would be for the overflow from the Dublin city area, so to speak. For want of a better description &ndash; Dubs could live in these areas. Outside these areas, growth would be limited strictly to local growth. The guidelines do not define what this meant.</P>
      <P>In Wicklow we drew up development plans for Kilcoole and Newtownmountkennedy. The amount of land zoned exceeded what was interpreted as being required for local growth. The Minister intervened and requested that the plans be changed to allow for downsizing of the population estimate given that it would deal only with local growth.</P>
      <P>In recent months Wicklow County Council, following the advice of the manager, has introduced a variation to the county development plan based on an interpretation by management of the strategic planning guidelines which, in essence, means that people outside Wicklow cannot buy a new house outside Bray, Greystones, Delgany, Wicklow or Arklow. This decision was made on the basis of a literal interpretation of the strategic planning guidelines. I have sought to establish from the Minister if this is a correct interpretation. To the best of my knowledge neither Dublin city nor county nor Meath nor Kildare have followed suit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have serious concerns about this interpreta<Col N="1605" /> tion because one of the main reasons for it is that it would make houses cheaper for locals. More than 60% of the population of County Wicklow lives in Bray, Greystones, Delgany, Arklow and Wicklow. These are the only places in County Wicklow in which people from outside it will be allowed to live. This means competition for housing in these areas will be greater and house prices will increase while, in the remainder of the county, houses will not be built because developers will move to neighbouring counties where there will be no restriction on the people who can purchase houses. It has been a condition of the granting of some planning permissions in Wicklow that the local authority more or less vets the applicants.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that I would have a difficulty with the principle, given that there is enough division in society without creating more man-made ones, it will give rise to stagnation in many towns and villages in County Wicklow. The interpretation of Wicklow County Council is either right or wrong. If it is wrong, the Minister should let the council know and, if it is correct, he should ensure Dublin, Meath and Kildare follow suit. I tabled a parliamentary question on this today and the Minister said in reply that the development plans for Meath and Wicklow have since been adopted. My understanding is that Meath has not followed suit. Permission has been granted for houses in Trim which anyone can purchase.</P>
    <P>This is an anti-social, divisive and unworkable measure. I seek some guidance from the Minister rather than efforts to side-step the issue. I have tabled questions on this, the responses to which have been unclear. I have also written to the Minister and have not received a clear response. I do not know if the Minister, Deputy Jacob, can help me, but it is a matter I will pursue until I obtain a correct answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue which I will address as the Minister is unable to attend this evening. I know that he has pursued this in the past and the Minister wanted to be here to discuss the matter with him.</P>
      <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, published in March 1999, set out an integrated land use and transportation framework for the sustainable development of the greater Dublin area. They were commissioned by the constituent local authorities in the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities. The Department of the Environment and Local Government also participated in the preparatory process. The guidelines were prepared with the full and active involvement of all the local planning authorities in the region. It is important to stress this point to dispel any suggestion that they were prepared by outside interests and imposed on the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> The strategic planning guidelines set out a coherent strategic planning framework for local authority development plans and for the provision of major transportation, sanitary services and other infrastructure. They set out separate development strategies for the metropolitan area and the hinterland area, as defined in the guidelines. The metropolitan area, that is, the built up area of Dublin and its immediate environs, is to be consolidated through development at higher densities, redevelopment of brownfield sites and intensification of uses. In the hinterland area, growth is to be concentrated in identified development centres of Naas-Newbridge-Kilcullen, Navan, Balbriggan, Wicklow and Drogheda. These centres are to develop as self-sufficient towns and housing development is to be matched by similar growth in employment and service provision. Outside the metropolitan area and the hinterland's development centres, development is to be primarily to meet local, rather than regional, need.</P>
    <P>In advance of new legislation to give statutory force to the guidelines, in April 1999 the Department requested each local authority in the greater Dublin area to ensure that its development plan was aligned with the strategy set out in the strategic planning guidelines. A further letter of 14 August 2000 also asked local authorities to advise the Department as to progress to date in this regard. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, the relevant provisions of which commenced on 1 January 2001, now require planning authorities to have regard to the guidelines when making and adopting a development plan.</P>
    <P>In accordance with its role as statutory consultee for development plans, the Department examined draft development plans which were prepared in 2000 by Kildare, Meath and Wicklow county councils and wrote to each of those councils between December 2000 and January 2001 raising a number of issues of concern in relation to compliance with the strategic planning guidelines. The development plans for Meath and Wicklow have been adopted.</P>
    <P>The future arrangements for strategic land use planning in the greater Dublin area are being considered in the context of legislation being prepared on the institutional arrangements for land use and transport in the area. In the consultation paper issued jointly in March 2001 by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Public Enterprise, it was proposed that a new Dublin strategic land use and transportation policy should, <i>inter alia,</i> take over responsibility for the review and updating of the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, overseeing the implementation of the guidelines to ensure that the land use planning policies and individual planning decisions of local authorities are consistent with them. The intention in assigning responsibility for strategic <Col N="1607" /> land use planning to the proposed strategic land use and transport body is to ensure that there is an effective and integrated strategic planning framework for land use and transport in place which is regularly reviewed and updated by that body. The proposed body has the power to ensure that the strategic planning framework is complied with at local level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> Extensive consultation has taken place on the proposals and I assure the House that the ensuing legislation will take account of the submissions received in response to this process.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 October 2001.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As a small open economy with a high degree of integration into the global economy, economic conditions and living standards in Ireland are essentially determined by our ability to trade in international markets and to capture an adequate share of mobile investment with its associated high productivity jobs. The current downturn in the domestic and global economies will require everyone to adjust to the new economic conditions to sustain Ireland's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In this context, responsible cost developments must be a first priority. The terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness must be adhered to and business must contribute to lowering inflation by avoiding margin-building. Social partnership provides the best foundation for economic stability and social progress during the current uncertain economic environment and into the future. Since the first of the current agreements came into effect, total employment has risen by 600,000, or 55%, and disposable incomes have also risen very significantly in real terms.</P>
      <P>Tackling the existing infrastructural deficit will also improve competitiveness over the medium term. Transport and other infrastructure-related deficiencies impose significant additional costs on the economy. In this regard, it is important that these key elements of the programme of capital expenditure set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 be kept on course. This must be achieved, however, within a sustainable fiscal framework, a crucial factor in maintaining confidence of investors and consumers.</P>
      <P>At a micro level, measures aimed at increasing productivity can also boost competitiveness, by reducing the unit cost of producing goods and services in Ireland. We must continue to implement measures which boost productivity at the firm level, and more generally, for example, by continuing to improve the skills of the population through education and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulatory reform must also remain a priority. Promoting competition, eliminating barriers to market entry and reducing red tape can all boost <Col N="1610" /> competitiveness by reducing inflation, enhancing efficiency, increasing innovation and reducing costs faced by firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a short meeting with the president of Irish Bankers' Federation, Mr. John Collins, on 5 July last. I gave a brief update on the state of play on the proposed new financial regulator, the Asset Covered Securities Bill, 2001 and the Dormant Accounts Bill, 2001. The substantive issue discussed at our meeting was the code of practice on branch restructuring, customer communications and relations, developed by the IBF and the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association. I would remind the House that I have no statutory function in regard to decisions relating to the location or size of bank branch networks, which are the prerogative of credit institutions themselves. They must be free to make decisions on the maintenance, closure or opening of branches based on their own commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>The key elements of the code of practice in relation to branch restructuring include a minimum notice period of two months before bank branches would be closed and, in the interest of good customer and community relations, a commitment to give an explanation of the reasons for closing individual branches. The code was published on 16 July and copies are available from banks and from the IBF website. Retail banks and building societies have agreed to be bound by the code. I welcome the code of practice as a positive step towards alleviating some of the difficulties which arise when local banks close.</P>
      <P>I accept that banks must react to changing commercial circumstances and the opportunities offered by new technology, such as telephone and internet banking. However, despite the commitment under the code of practice to begin a process of familiarising customers with alternative banking facilities, the way in which certain changes have recently been introduced by some banks is to be regretted. It is imperative that financial institutions have regard to the needs of all their customers but, in particular, the needs of vulnerable customers such as older people and those with disabilities. This point is one I intend to raise again with the banks and their representative bodies when I next have that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> It is my intention that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will have a strong focus on consumer issues and, in that context, it would be appropriate for the new authority to monitor and report on access to banking services.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it is not customary for the Minister for Finance to indicate in advance what measures, if any, will be taken in the budget. It is not my intention to break with this tradition.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the national climate change strategy, a cross-departmental climate change team has been established to ensure early implementation of the strategy. The team is chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A number of support groups have also been established to assist the team including an economic analysis sub-group. Taxation issues arising from the work of the climate change team are considered by the tax strategy group which is chaired by an official from my Department.</P>
      <P>As I have said in the past, taxation can play a part in attaining environmental goals. However, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that tax measures take into account the effect on Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the position in relation to the treatment of mileage expenses under the income tax system is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an employee uses his or her car in the course of his or her employment, he or she is entitled to claim a tax deduction under section 114 Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 in respect of expenses that are &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necess<Col N="1612" /> arily incurred&rdquo; in the performance of the duties of the employment. No relief is due for the cost of travelling to and from the place of employment.</P>
    <P>Where the employer reimburses the employee for such expenses, these expenses are in strictness taxable in the hands of the employee under section 117 of Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, subject to a claim for relief under section 114. In practice Revenue allow for the making of payments without deduction of tax where the employer uses rates of reimbursement which do not exceed the schedule of Civil Service mileage rates. The Revenue practice is based on the premise that the Civil Service mileage rates do no more than reimburse employees for tax allowable expenditure, without providing any personal gain to them.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no revenue foregone by the Exchequer arising from treating these payments as expenses like any other.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as income earners are not required to include mileage allowances in their tax returns, there is, therefore, no statistical basis on which they can provide an estimate relating to the amounts involved.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's inquiry about the number of miles claimed in relation to each category of engine size, this information, which relates not only to bodies in the Civil and Public Service but in the private sector as well, is not centrally compiled by the State. It could involve a disproportionate effort to collate this for the public sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 require financial institutions to take reasonable measures to identify their customers. This involves verification of a prospective customer's name and address. The recommended procedures used for this purpose are set out in guidance notes issued by the money laundering steering committee which includes representatives of the financial institutions and of the regulatory authorities and is chaired by the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Although the guidance notes give banks discretion to take account of the circumstances of customers who may not posses the recommended forms of name and address verification, I am aware that certain groups, including immigrant workers have experienced difficulties in this area. To deal with these problems revised guidance notes have been drawn up which give banks more specific guidance on the documents they should seek and should help to deal with the difficulties experienced by certain groups in opening bank accounts. These revised guidance notes are expected to be issued within the next few weeks and should be implemented by banks over the coming months following training of their staff in the revised procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that, although the revised guidance <Col N="1614" /> notes should reduce the difficulties referred to by the Deputy, banks currently have discretion to deal with such difficulties and in the particular case of immigrant workers these are often resolved by an approach by the employer to a bank. If, however, the Deputy is aware of situations where immigrant workers have not been able to open bank accounts I would be happy to take the matter up with the Central Bank if he provides me with the details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget day forecast for tax revenues, implied an increase of 12.5% in receipts in 2001 over the 2000 out-turn. This compares with an increase of 2.2% for the first nine months of 2001 over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The tax forecast was predicated on economic growth of 8.8% in GDP terms and assumed the broad pattern of income and expenditure, which was observed in the recent years of strong growth in taxes, would continue in 2001.</P>
      <P>Since last December, a number of occurrences have combined to reduce expected growth in the economy. There has been a very dramatic slowdown in the global economy. Last autumn, the European Commission forecast EU economic growth for 2001 at 3.1% and US economic growth at 3.3%. By April of this year, the Commission had revised its 2001 forecast for EU growth to 2.8% and had halved its forecast for US growth to 1.6%. In the six months since April, the economic outlook has clearly deteriorated further.</P>
      <P>As would be expected, the international downturn is having a negative effect on domestic economic growth. At the time of the publication of the Economic Review and Outlook in August, the forecast for 2001 GDP growth had fallen to 7.2%. The impact of the attacks of 11 September in the United States will have a further negative impact on this forecast.</P>
      <P>The restrictions which were put in place earlier in the year, to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease also had a dampening effect on economic growth and a significant impact on tax revenues. The nature of the restrictions had a more detrimental impact on some sectors of the economy, particularly in the areas of tourism, leisure and entertainment. They were also at least partly responsible for the sharp increase in the number of Irish people holidaying abroad this year. VAT receipts and excise duties were particularly badly hit by the restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of new cars registered to end September 2001 had fallen by 29% over the same <Col N="1615" /> period in 2000. Because of the high tax content of new cars, this reduction has resulted in a reduction in the level of excise duty in 2001 over 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, tax concessions of approximately £100 million, over and above those given in budget 2001, were made in the Finance Act earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The methodology to estimate the level of tax receipts in 2001 is similar to that used in recent years and is detailed in the report of the tax forecasting methodology review group, which is available on my Department's website. The forecasting methodology is kept under constant review by my Department. It is clear however that the relationship one observes between tax revenue and economic growth at high levels may not be as robust when economic growth suddenly and sharply deteriorates. This factor will have to be taken account of when framing future forecasts.</P>

      <Quest>the main features of the recently launched Civil Service Gender Equality Policy; the steps being taken to implement the objectives of the policy within his Department and the public service generally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25358/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Gender Equality Policy for the Civil Service Policy was formally launched by the Taoiseach and myself on Tuesday, 25 September 2001.</P>
      <P>The policy is designed to bring a more strategic focus to the achievement of gender equality in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, it clearly restates the commitment of the Civil Service to gender equality and the principles under which the policy operates. These key principles state that equality of opportunity directly or indirectly affects all aspects of everyone's working life, that inequality of opportunity is illegal, that it is morally and socially unjustifiable, and is wasteful of the main asset of the Civil Service, namely, the people who work in it. As part of the new approach, the policy requires individual Departments to set strategic objectives and equality goals for increasing women's representation at all levels. However, there is a problem at management levels. There are very few women at higher management in Departments, although they are the majority in the clerical and executive grades and in the Civil Service as a whole. Women form 69% of staff in the lower grades, but make up only 23% at management grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy requires Departments to implement a programme of affirmative action to deal with obstacles to career progression for women identified in their own organisations. These initiatives will be taken in the main human resource man<Col N="1616" /> agement areas of recruitment, placement and mobility, training and staff development, promotion, work and family issues, language and harassment.</P>
    <P>To give a particular focus to Departments' planning, the Government has set a target for the key assistant principal grade. Departments must work to ensure that, by 2005, 33% of assistant principal posts are filled by women. At present, women fill 27% of these posts. By increasing the number of women at that grade, there will be a larger number of women who can be promoted to the more senior levels.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of strategic objectives and equality goals for assistant principals and other grades in each Department's statement of strategy is a key to the achievement of gender equality in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Under the strategic management initiative for the modernisation of the Civil Service, each head of Department is required to report annually to his or her Minister on progress in relation to all the strategic objectives, goals and action plans specified in the Department's strategy statement. These annual reports are presented to Government and laid before the Oireachtas. Progress on gender equality in the Civil Service will therefore be monitored on an annual basis and at the highest level.</P>
    <P>The policy documents also sets out the responsibilities of everyone involved in achieving gender equality, from the head of Department to individual staff. Detailed guidelines on accountability for the policy are also provided.</P>
    <P>Within the Department of Finance, targets have been set which, over the next five years and subject to the number of vacancies arising, should see the representation of women increasing from 28% to close to 35% in the assistant principal grade and from 14% to close to 25% at the principal grade.</P>
    <P>A policy is being prepared for the Department which will address a wide range of equality issues in accordance with the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>Other Departments are adopting broadly similar strategies.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank Autumn Bulletin 2001 contained forecasts of 6.25% and 5% for GDP growth in 2001 and 2002 respectively. Growth in GNP terms was forecast at 6% in 2001 and 4.5% in 2002, with employment increasing by 45,000 in 2001 and by 34,000 in 2002. These forecasts were made prior to 11 September and as such do not take into account the economic implications of the US terrorist attacks on the Irish or global economies. <Col N="1617" /> The press release accompanying the autumn bulletin stated that if world trade volumes were reduced by the order of 2% to 3% that this would reduce the Central Bank's GNP forecast for the next year to less than 3.5%.</P>
      <P>It is difficult, just a month after the event to assess the full economic impact of the attacks on Ireland's growth and employment prospects. Obviously much depends on the effect on the world economy as a whole and on reactions to the ongoing military response. Estimates by market commentators for Ireland's GNP growth next year vary between 1% and 6%. This illustrates the degree of uncertainty in the current global economic environment. My Department will as usual publish its estimates for economic growth when the budget is being delivered. Policy at this juncture must be geared towards ensuring that, when the international economy recovers, Ireland is positioned to benefit fully from that recovery.</P>
      <P>I am confident that in the medium term, as the global economic environment recovers, we can achieve satisfactory levels of growth which will benefit us all.</P>

However, it confirmed that it was not in a position at present to undertake a project of this scale, having regard to its present and ongoing commitments. I also understand that the Mount Falcon property is under consideration to be deemed a protected structure in the next development plan for the county.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their <Col N="1618" /> Ansbacher review team has been carrying out detailed investigations since October 1999.</P>
      <P>The investigation has essentially two elements. There are Ansbacher-type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</P>
      <P>Revenue has indicated there are 182 Ansbacher-type cases consisting of 121 cases named by the authorised officer and 61 similar cases discovered by Revenue. Of these, a total of 153 are under active investigation. Inquiries have not yet commenced in the remaining 29 because of insufficient identity information, non-residency or the 1993 amnesty being claimed. The investigation includes examining the tax position of disclosed entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in relation to core cases under investigation is now more than 600.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility for training and development of Civil Service staff rests with each Department. Under the public service modernisation process, <Col N="1621" /> it is the responsibility of each Department to develop an integrated human resources strategy which includes provision for staff training and development.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness sets out a number of basic objectives for enhancing training and development for management and staff at all levels in the Civil Service. It set a basic target spend on Civil Service training and development of 4% of payroll to be achieved by 2003. Progress towards achieving this target has been made with average expenditure on training and development increasing to 2.45% of payroll in 2000, with some Departments having already exceeded the target.</P>
      <P>Implementation by Departments of the new performance management and development system, PMDS, which was designed in consultation with staff and unions, is generally progressing well. PMDS provides a comprehensive framework to ensure that the training and development needs of the individual are identified and links those needs directly to the business and strategic objectives of the Department or office.</P>
      <P>The quality assurance groups set up under the PPF are required to take into account the extent to which the increased commitment to training and development is contributing to greater organisational capability and flexibility in the delivery of customer needs and preferences.</P>
      <P>My Department's centre for management and organisation development, CMOD, recently circulated to Departments a consultative policy document, Towards Learning, on a strategic approach to human resource development in the Civil Service in the medium term. CMOD will be consulting with Departments over the coming months with a view to putting in place, in partnership with them, a strategy to address the full range of learning needs emerging in the service.</P>
      <P>As regards partnership, a consultancy study entitled, Partnership at Work in Ireland &ndash; An Evaluation of Progress under Partnership 2000, by consultants O'Donnell and Teague found that there has been significant progress on partnership in the Civil Service. Partnership committees have been established in every Department or office and most have formulated action programmes to implement their Department's strategy in a partnership mode.</P>
      <P>The General Council Agreement on partnership provided for a review of partnership after a period of time in operation. A review of the partnership process is under way in accordance with the terms of the PPF. This will, among other things, consider the support needed to further develop the partnership structures.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of compensation payable when there is a default on client funds or stocks, held by stockbrokers; and his views on whether a comprehensive scheme similar to the Law Society Compensation Fund should be introduced.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Investor Compensation Company Limited, ICCL, was established in 1998 under the Investor Compensation Act, 1998. Its main function is the establishment and maintenance of compensation arrangements for making compensation payments to clients of investment and insurance intermediaries, including stock exchange member firms and banks providing investment business services. The 1998 Act transposed the EU Investor Compensation Directive into Irish law </P>
      <P>Under the legislation, ICCL is required to establish or maintain a fund or funds out of which payments are made in accordance with the Act. The industry is responsible for funding the compensation scheme. The scheme provides that compensation paid to eligible investors is the lesser of 20,000 &ndash; £15,751 &ndash; or 90% of the net losses suffered through the default of the investment entity in question. This is the minimum level of compensation required by the directive.</P>
      <P>The Law Society Compensation Fund to which the Deputy has referred was established in 1954 at the instigation of the profession and was put on a statutory basis under the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994 and is intended to provide compensation for loss due to the dishonesty of a solicitor or the clerk or servant of a solicitor. The maximum amount of compensation available under the scheme is £350,000 or 444,408. The Law Society's scheme covers dishonesty only, and this would be narrower than the ICCL scheme, which would also cover negligence. However, the Law Society requires all its members, as a condition for obtaining their annual practising certificate, to also hold professional indemnity insurance.</P>
      <P>While, as indicated above, there is a wide divergence between the maximum level of compensation available under the two &ndash; 20,000 <i>vis-à-vis</i> 44,408 &ndash; there are a number of important considerations underlying the ICCL scheme.</P>
      <P>First, it is important to establish a level of compensation which is within the capacity of the investment sector and insurance intermediary sector in this country to finance. The scheme was only established in the latter part of 1998 and it was difficult to gauge at the outset what level of compensation might be required and what the scale of contributions might be. Schemes such as this need time to get established and to build up their reserves. In fact, there have already been a number of demands on the scheme where various investment entities failed and the impact on contributing firms over the next two years or so could be significant. In the circumstances, I would not be disposed to increasing the level of compensation provided under the ICCL scheme at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, investor compensation is a form of insurance protection. The industry will inevitably seek, where possible, to pass this cost back to the <Col N="1623" /> investor. It is difficult to gauge what level of funding the investor or the industry can reasonably bear until the scheme has been up and running smoothly for a number of years.</P>

      <P>At the informal ECOFIN in Liége on the 21 September 2001, I and my fellow economic and finance Ministers issued a statement on the &ldquo;Economic Impact of the Terrorist attacks on the US&rdquo;. The statement included a commitment to pursue sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms aimed at fostering growth, employment and competitiveness and maintaining price stability. The statement made clear that this together with the fall in inflation, recent tax reductions and favourable financing conditions will create conditions for a gradual strengthening of domestic demand in the EU as a whole.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above statement, the finance Ministers also announced in Liége a list of &ldquo;Actions to combat the financing of terrorism&rdquo;. I will make a copy of both statements available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards what we in Ireland can do, we need to remain committed to implementing the full terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, in order to avoid any weakening of Ireland's international competitiveness. We must sustain investor and business confidence through continued responsible management of the public finances and ensure the full implementation of the national development plan, NDP, which will help ensure that our infrastructure, both physical and human is able to meet the considerable challenges of the new economic environment after 11 September. I am confident that in the medium term, as the global economic environment recovers, we can achieve satisfactory levels of economic growth which will benefit us all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the monthly returns to date made by the qualifying savings managers under the new savings scheme, the total tax credits claimed by the <Col N="1624" /> institutions so far amount to some £31.9 million or 40.5 million in respect of deposits of £128.7 million or 163.4 million. The number of special savings incentive accounts in operation will not be available until after 28 February 2002, when the first comprehensive annual returns giving details of individual accounts are furnished by the qualified savings managers. As I have indicated before in replying to Parliamentary Questions regarding, <i>inter alia</i>, the likely cost of the scheme, it is difficult to estimate the Exchequer cost of the special savings incentive scheme because of its very nature. It is new and innovative and the size of the Exchequer contribution will depend on take-up by participants in the scheme. When the question was being looked at prior to the publication of the Finance Bill, my Department considered various ranges of costs based on different assumptions. As I said on 20 February in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 36 from Deputy Jim Mitchell, a tentative estimate is for a full year cost of around £100 million &ndash; 127 million &ndash; for the savings scheme. In so far as the take-up turns out to be very strong, then this figure may have to be revised upward. The more successful the scheme is, the more relief it will entail. Figures to date indicate that the cost to the Exchequer for the first five months of the scheme is some £32 million or 40.6 million.</P>
      <P>However, it is not possible to extrapolate reliably from these figures what the 12-month cost to the Exchequer of the SSIA scheme will be. It is likely, however, that the £100 million or 127 million figure that I have already referred to will be reached.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the circumstances under which the home caring spouse tax allowance is payable; and if he will ensure that it is available in all cases of disabled spouses where the other spouse is the sole earner in the household.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25278/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The home carer's tax allowance, now converted into a tax credit, amounting to £3,000 or 3,810 at the standard rate of tax, was introduced in the Finance Act, 2000, in respect of those spouses of married one income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons. It may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed to tax and where one spouse, the home carer, cares for one or more dependent persons.</P>
      <P>A dependent person is defined as a child in respect of whom child benefit is being paid, a person aged 65 years or over, or a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental of physical infirmity. The definition of a dependent person does not include a spouse as the allowance was never intended to cater for such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum tax credit due for a tax year is £600 or 762. Where the home carer has income <Col N="1625" /> in his or her own right, the tax credit may still be due. The tax credit is due in full where the home carer's income is less than £4,000 or 5,080. Where the carer's income is between £4, 000 or 5,080 and £5,200 or 6,604, the tax credit is reduced by £1 for every £2 of income so that where the income exceeds £5,200 or 6,604, no tax credit will be due. These figures are reduced proportionately for the short tax year, 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Deputy that an income tax relief is available in respect of the cost of employing a person to care for a permanently incapacitated person, including one's spouse. The carer may be employed on an individual basis or through an agency. The amount of the relief due for a full tax year is the cost of employing the carer subject to a maximum of £10,000 or 12,700 &ndash; this equates to £7,400 or 9,398 for the short tax year. Relief can be claimed at the individual's marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to extend the home carer's tax credit as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>On 8 August last, a torrential downpour took place in Dublin which put extreme pressure on the cast iron rainwater pipes in the Leinster House basement, not in LH 2000, resulting in a major fracture in an old pipe. This <Col N="1626" /> led to the flooding which knocked out the phone system.</P>
      <P>The cost of plugging the pipe and mopping up, which was carried out by on-site Office of Public Works personnel, assisted by contractors, was negligible. Repairs to the wiring of the phone system cost £49,278.61 which will be borne on the Oireachtas Vote. The cause of the incident was not due to the actions of any construction company.</P>
      <P>A programme of surveying and clearing all drains in Leinster House had been under way for some time prior to 8 August. Access for contractors to do this type of work was restricted to times when the Dáil, Oireachtas Committees, etc., were not in session. The programme continued throughout the summer recess and will continue on a regular basis into the future. Further works to improve drainage are also planned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I must begin by saying that the brutality and wickedness of the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 were an affront to humanity. These attacks were such a human tragedy, it may seem somehow inappropriate to discuss their economic implications. However, there is no denying that the economic impact of these events will be felt all over the world.</P>
      <P>The exact extent and duration of the economic impact on the United States will very much depend on the ongoing military response and whether or not this leads to further terrorist activity. It will also depend on the reaction of consumer confidence in the United States to these unfolding events.</P>
      <P>As far as the economic implications of the attacks for Ireland are concerned, because we have an open economy heavily reliant on trade and foreign investment and on international travel and tourism, they will obviously have unfavourable implications for us too.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult, just over a month after the event, to assess the full economic impact of the attacks on Ireland's growth and employment. Estimates by market commentators for GNP growth next year vary between 1% and 6%. These estimates are lower than previous forecasts. This illustrates the degree of uncertainty in the current global economic environment. My Department will as usual publish its estimates for economic growth when the budget is being delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent events underline the need for a prudent approach to the public finances, particularly over <Col N="1627" /> the coming months, in order to ensure that the economy weathers the present stormy conditions. Looking slightly further ahead, I have no doubt that in the medium term with the right approach, we can pass through these short-term difficulties and achieve satisfactory levels of economic growth which will benefit us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI's medium term review provides a useful framework for analysing the likely economic conditions over the medium term. The latest MTR contains two broad scenarios &ndash; the benchmark forecast and a slowdown scenario. Under the benchmark forecast, the economy slows gradually to trend growth with annual GNP growth averaging 4.8% over the period 2000-2005. Annual employment growth under this scenario averages 2% over this period.</P>
      <P>Under a less benign slowdown scenario, which the ESRI suggests may be closer to reality in prevailing circumstances, it is assumed that the economy is hit by a shock which causes output and employment growth to decelerate more rapidly over the short term. While unemployment is seen to rise, both output and employment growth recover over the medium term.</P>
      <P>I also take the view that, with the right approach, the Irish economy can pass through these short-term difficulties and, as the global environment recovers, achieve satisfactory levels of economic growth. In line with current practice, my Department will publish revised forecasts for the period 2002-2004 on budget day, 5 December.</P>

      <P>On 29 May 2000, the EU Commission requested information from the Irish authorities relating to two tax provisions in the Irish tax code relating to foreign income, i.e. the tax reliefs for certain repatriated dividends, formerly section 41 of the 1988 Finance Act, now section 222 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, and for certain branch profits, formerly section 29 of the 1995 Finance Act, now section 847 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.

      <P>The Commission examined the information supplied and decided on 11 July 2001 to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty. Under this procedure, the Commission gives notice to the member state concerned to submit its comments and if the Commission subsequently considers that the aid granted by the state is not compatible with the common market having regard to Article 87 of the treaty, it shall decide that the state concerned should abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The Commission accordingly wrote to the Irish authorities on 11 July asking them to submit their comments and a detailed reply was sent to the Commission on 4 October last. It should be noted that section 86 of the Finance Act, 2001, effectively abolished the relief for dividends repatriated to an Irish parent company from its foreign subsidiaries by providing that the exemption can only apply to dividends certified by the Minister for Finance before 15 February 2001. Furthermore, section 89 of the Finance Act, 2001 provides that no company may avail of the relief for foreign branch profits unless it holds a certificate issued by the Minister for Finance before 15 February 2001.</P>

The Marine laboratories will be located at Oranmore, County Galway, on a site that was previously occupied by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the costs of acquiring it are expected to be minimal. The estimated construction cost of the new laboratories in Galway is £31 million, 39 million, including inflation, fees and VAT.</P>

      <Quest>the progress of the HIPC and other initiatives in order to alleviate the burden of Third World debt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The HIPC initiative provides a comprehensive framework aimed at reducing the external debt stocks of heavily indebted poor countries to sustainable levels. The resources thus released are expected to support sustained economic growth and poverty reduction in these countries. The initiative covers both multilateral and official bilateral debt in roughly even proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> The up-to-date position on HIPC is that a total of 23 countries have reached their decision point and are benefiting from debt relief. Two of the 23 have reached their completion points and are finalising their poverty reduction strategy papers. Fifteen more countries are expected to reach decision point by the end of 2002. It is expected that about 38 countries could ultimately qualify for debt relief under the HIPC initiative. I am conscious that individual countries, at completion stage, may need to be examined on a case by case basis with a view to ensuring that they are not left with unsustainable debt.</P>
    <P>It can be seen that considerable progress has been made in the implementation of the HIPC terms. It remains to be seen, however, whether the existing terms will be adequate for all of the countries concerned or whether further enhancements of the initiative will be required in order to bring about true debt sustainability. My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are keeping the progress of HIPC under close review and I take every opportunity to urge the maximum degree of flexibility and generosity on the part of the creditor countries.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the HIPC initiative delivers on its aims and that countries are not left with unsustainable debt. We cannot have a situation where countries that are committed to good governance and tackling poverty reduction are, after full HIPC relief, still spending an undue proportion of their budget on debt servicing or more on this than on their social programmes.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the overall aim of development in which debt is only one element. Both the Department of Foreign Affairs and my Department are working closely in preparing for the upcoming UN conference in Mexico next March on financing for development.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the very high level of proof required to sustain a criminal prosecution and that prosecutions can only be taken where such evidence is available. Sentencing is a matter for the courts taking all aspects of a case into account.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are satisfied with the progress being made by Revenue under their more active criminal prosecutions programme for serious tax evasion and their proposal to set up a specialised prosecution division to further enhance progress in this area. I understand that the number of cases being advanced to the courts is in line, on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, with corresponding cases in the UK.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in addition to the above cases of serious tax evasion, Revenue obtains in excess of 1,000 convictions each year for failure to file tax returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is an ongoing high level of inquiry and contact with them about the arrangements. The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioners indicated publicly last week that with a month still to go to the deadline, amounts actually paid to them under the arrangements total over £10 million, 12.8 million, in respect of some 300 cases. The Commissioners have stated that previous experience of deadlines suggests that most of those availing of the benefits, offered until 15 November, will wait until that deadline arrives to pay up. Revenue's media campaign and comments last week were designed to remind people that, even if they do not pay until the deadline, they have work to do in advance if they are not to miss out.</P>
      <P>For those who pay up by 15 November, Revenue has publicised the very real benefits in terms of anonymity, interest and penalties capped at 100% of the tax due together with no investigation for prosecution. Revenue has also warned those thinking of &ldquo;lying low&rdquo; that it will be using its strong new powers which require banks and building societies to provide information about all bogus non-resident account holders. Banks and building societies have advertised that they will be co-operating fully with the use of those powers.</P>
      <P>Revenue have stressed that each identified bogus non-resident account holder who has not paid up by the deadline will be individually investigated no matter how long it takes and that they will be exposed publicly as tax evaders and made to pay much more in interest and penalties than they would pay now. Some will be investigated for criminal prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>From estimates supplied to my Department in respect of Departments and relevant bodies, the cost to the Exchequer of the changeover to the euro is estimated to be of the order of £100 million, 127 million. Changeover costs are of course one-off, whereas economic and monetary union confers ongoing benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the basic facts about the euro are now widely known, thanks to the extensive public information activities undertaken to date. A national survey of public awareness of the euro was conducted in July 2001 on behalf of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland. The results showed that 87% of people know that euro cash will arrive on 1 January 2002, and 84% know that <Col N="1633" /> the euro is made up of cents. A total of 79% know what a pound is worth in euros and 46% are generally aware of the length of the dual circulation period. The survey also revealed that people now want to know how the changeover will work, how to convert and what euro cash will look like.</P>
    <P>Since July the ECBI has intensified its public information campaign and is currently distributing a 24-page colour handbook on the euro changeover to every household in the country. The handbook explains what the euro is, what it is worth and how to get ready for it, how the changeover to euro cash will work, what we can all do to help the changeover, what euro notes and coins will look like and what the key organisations will do for the changeover.</P>
    <P>The handbook also explains how to convert from Irish pounds to euro and from euro to Irish pounds, shows conversion tables for standard amounts and gives contact points for further information. In addition to the handbook, the board is distributing over half a million information items a month otherwise and is running an extensive advertising campaign. Finally, the board aims to distribute an electronic converter to every household in November.</P>

      <P>Since before the FOI Act came into force in 1998, procedures have existed to support its implementation and to review its operation on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Briefly, these include the FOI central policy unit, which supports FOI officers and decision-makers in all bodies that are covered by the legislation and maintains regular contact with the main FOI user networks. In addition, there is an interdepartmental working group in place which meets regularly under the chairmanship of an officer of Assistant Secretary rank to review the operation of the Act and to consider developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Information Commissioner has statutory functions in relation to the operation of FOI. In a recent report prepared by the Information Commissioner in performance of his function to examine compliance with the FOI Act, he found that the procedures and practices adopted for the purposes of handling requests under the Act are generally satisfactory. Overall, the Information Commissioner gave a positive report on the first three years of the operation of FOI, expressing the view that the Act had brought about major gains in openness and transparency in the public <Col N="1634" /> service. Over 40,000 requests have been made since FOI came into force in 1998, during which time it has been extended from 67 to more than 300 bodies.</P>
    <P>Of course, there will always be areas where public bodies can do things better and the Information Commissioner made a range of recommendations identifying certain areas requiring attention. The main general criticism related to where information is refused, in some bodies, the proper statement of reasons failed to meet the requirements of the Act. These recommendations will need to be examined very carefully. In order to address the issues raised, a special subgroup of the interdepartmental working group has been established to consider the Information Commissioner's recommendations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Act itself, a report was prepared on technical and procedural issues relating to the Act and its operation by the Civil Service users' network in December 1999. Consideration is being given at official level to the issues identified in that report.</P>

      <P>In Exchequer terms, the budget day forecast was for a surplus of 3,222 million, or £2,538 million, which was equivalent to 3.3% of GNP. The end of September forecast was that the Exchequer surplus would be at least 1.9 billion, or £1.5 billion lower than the budget day forecast and possibly significantly more. These Exchequer figures exclude the proceeds from the new voluntary disclosure scheme and the sales of the TSB and the ICC.</P>
      <P>Last December, the forecast for 2001 economic growth, published in conjunction with the budget, was for an increase of 8.8% in GDP and of 7.4% in GNP. My Department's most recent forecast for 2001 economic growth, published in economic review and outlook, is for an increase of 7.2% in GDP and an increase of 6% in GNP. This forecast was prepared in August 2001 and, therefore, does not take account of the impact of the events of 11 September in the United States on global and domestic economic activity. It is very difficult, just a month after the events to assess the full economic impact of the attacks on Ireland's economic growth. Obviously much depends on the effects on the world economy as a whole and on reactions to the ongoing military response. My Department will as usual publish its estimates for economic growth with the budget.</P>
      <P>The economic environment has clearly altered radically compared to this time last year. Obviously a reduced tax base has implications going forward for increased tax revenue, for surpluses and for debt. These factors are being examined in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>Policy at this juncture must be geared towards ensuring that, when the international economy recovers, Ireland is positioned to benefit fully from that recovery. I am satisfied that in the medium term, as the global economic environment recovers, we can achieve satisfactory levels of growth which will benefit us all.</P>

      <P>My Department is the designated managing authority for two of the operational programmes under the national development plan. These are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme. My Department is also responsible for a number of measures under the regional operational programmes. Measures in the operational programmes are administered by the State-agencies under the aegis of my Department. Expenditure broken down at county level is not available.</P>
      <P>Under the productive sector operational programme the agencies involved in implementing measures are IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. The allocation of spending in the southern and eastern region by these agencies for the full year 2001 is 477 million and provisional returns from the agencies indicate that 78.6 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>
      <P>While expenditure under the productive sector operational programme by the development agencies has been less than forecast their expenditure on investment and other programmes overall is on target. There are a number of reasons for the low expenditure on the productive sector operational programme. Expenditure was still continuing in 2001 in respect of commitments made up to the end of 1999 under the industry operational programme 1994-99. In addition there was a considerable delay in a number of measures in obtaining State aid approval from the European Commission. Also with new schemes there is an inevitable time lag from the launch of schemes to the receipt and evaluation of proposals and the incurring of expenditure. It is anticipated that the level of expenditure under the programme will come on target over the next two years.</P>
      <P>Under the employment and human resources development operational programme the agencies involved in implementing measures are FÁS and Enterprise Ireland. The allocation for spending in the southern and eastern region under the operational programme by these agencies in 2001 is 636.67 million and provisional returns from the agencies indicate that 285.931 million has been spent to end June 2001.</P>

      <P>Only one work permit can issue for each full-time job. A second work permit for a part-time job cannot issue. A work permit will not issue unless the work entails at least 20 hours per week. If an employee does part-time work without a work permit they are working illegally.</P>
      <P>The Government announced last year a new labour market immigration policy designed to meet the skills requirements in the Irish economy over the next six years. A new work visa system now applies in respect of people coming from non European Economic Area countries to take up employment in Ireland in three specific sectors, i.e. information and computing technologies, construction professionals and nurses. The scheme allows the prospective employee to apply to the Irish embassy or consulate in their home country to have the relevant authorisation placed on their passport there. The working visa scheme is being extended shortly to include medical professionals.</P>
      <P>With reference to the Deputy's question concerning employment on a self-employed basis for non-EEA nationals, he/she would require business permission from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>Experience has shown that a small number of individuals continue to have difficulties in getting jobs following their participation on community employment. This is usually due to barriers such as age, health, literacy, numeracy or a lack of suitable jobs locally. In recognition of this, I have <Col N="1638" /> removed the three year limit on participation for people over 50 years of age in certain cases. In future, people over 50 who, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment, may have their participation in the programme extended. For such participants FÁS will have discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>FÁS has also been given the flexibility to offer a further period of participation of up to one year for those in the younger age groups who are also experiencing difficulty in obtaining employment. This flexibility will apply in those cases where it is clear that an extension would be of benefit to the participants in terms of improving their prospects of progressing to a job in the open labour market. The new arrangements will not apply in schools projects which are in the process of being mainstreamed. However, such participants may be facilitated in non-school projects.</P>
      <P>The following guidelines on the operation of the changes in CE policy have been issued to FÁS by my Department: over 25s on part-time integration option &ndash; current FÁS discretion to give participants an extra year is increased from 10% to 20% to meet the needs of individuals who would clearly benefit from such extension in terms of their future employment prospects; 35s to 50 years on part-time job option &ndash; FÁS will have discretion to give 20% of participants in this age group extensions of up to one year to meet the needs of individuals who would clearly benefit from such extension in terms of their future employment prospects; over 50s on part-time job option &ndash;  FÁS will have discretion to give 20% of participants in this group a further year on CE, with provision for review at the end of that year &ndash; further discretion will apply to extend participation beyond this on a case by case basis, subject to continued annual review; FÁS discretion to provide extensions on a case-by-case basis will be applied only to those participants, who on reaching the end of their period of normal entitlement, still experience difficulties in getting jobs, whether due to age, health, literacy, numeracy, or a lack of suitable jobs locally.</P>
      <P>The new rules for the operation of CE will be applied strictly within existing budgetary constraints and the overall target for restructuring the programme, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

    <P>It is not possible at this time and within the time available to provide a breakdown on a south and east county basis of expenditure to date by my Department under the NDP. My Department is at present rolling out the installation of an NDP computerised reporting system which will, among other matters, provide details of expenditure on a county basis. In any event, much expenditure, such as that on marketing, training and RTDI, can only be attributed indicatively on a regional and county basis.</P>
    <P>I have, however, arranged, in respect of the fishery harbours and coastal protection programmes, for details of actual public expenditure in 2000 and the 2001 approved programmes on a south and east county basis to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

Until the scheme is launched and formal application forms and guidelines are available applications cannot be accepted. However, all parties who have expressed an interest in the scheme, including those in Youghal, will be sent details and an application form as soon as they are available. Once the grant scheme is in place and a formal application received from the promoters of these projects, they will be assessed in accordance with the procedures laid down under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for an investment of £2 billion &ndash; 2.5 billion &ndash; to enhance public transport in the south and east region.</P>
      <P>To the end of June, 2001, almost £386.77 million &ndash; 491.10 million &ndash; has been spent on public transport projects in the south and east region. It is not possible at present to provide a breakdown of the expenditure to date on a county by county basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objectives of the investment is to upgrade the mainline rail infrastructure, rolling stock and facilities, upgrade the suburban rail and DART network, develop the light rail network, develop bus services in Dublin, in the major provincial cities and towns and to develop and improve rural bus services. These combined objectives will be achieved through: mainline rail investment in safety and renewal; enhanced suburban rail services through increased capacity on the DART and outer suburban rail services; increased frequency of suburban rail services; the introduction of the Luas services in 2003; regional bus improvements &ndash; provincial cities, rural and main routes from and to Dublin; Dublin city bus <Col N="1643" /> improvements; ongoing fleet replacement and re-equipment by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath; and accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities.</P>
    <P>The NDP monitoring committee established by my Department which includes representatives from the CIE group and the Department of Finance, is responsible for overseeing progress, both financial and physical, of the public transport projects.</P>
    <P>Under the airports measure of the national development plan, a sum of £3 million &ndash; 3.8 million &ndash; at 1999 prices, has been allocated to assist with necessary infrastructural upgrades and improvements at the two regional airports in the south and east region at Farranfore, Kerry, and Waterford.</P>
    <P>There has been no expenditure to date of this amount. However, my Department is currently examining and assessing the projects which have been submitted for support under the NDP by the two regional airport authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Aside from the funds provided for under the NDP, my Department also provides support for marketing activities and for safety and security measures at the regional airports. Over the two year period, 2000-2001, a total sum of £1.155 million &ndash; 1.467 million &ndash; has been allocated and expended under the scheme to the two airports in the south and east region as follows: Kerry airport £800,000 &ndash; 1.016 million, and Waterford airport £355,000 &ndash; 0.451 million. This allocation has been spent. In addition, my Department supports the operation of public service obligation air services on the Kerry-Dublin route.</P>
    <P>Under the sustainable energy priority within the framework of the national development plan £113.7 million &ndash; 144.4 million &ndash; is earmarked for investment in the south and east region. My Department has overall responsibility for the administration of this funding and the Irish Energy Centre which operates under the aegis of my Department, is the main conduit for implementing this priority. While expenditure to date in 2001 of £2.35 million &ndash; 2.99 million &ndash; has been incurred in the south and east region this would also have an impact in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>Under the e-commerce and communications measure of the NDP, there has been an allocation of £24.4 million &ndash; 31 million &ndash; by my Department. To date, there is no expenditure. Projects are cross-county undertakings. The breakdown by county will only become apparent when expenditure is reported.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 43 of 17 October, Iarnród Éireann has undertaken to carry out a feasibility study on the potential for re-opening the rail line to Midleton and for developing rail services to Blarney on the adoption by the local authorities of the Cork area strategic plan. The study has not yet been put out to tender and so the information requested by the Deputy is not yet available.</P>

When the evaluation process has been completed, I expect to receive formal proposals from the company for approval. The timescale from placing an order to delivery is likely to be approximately two years.</P>

      <P>The cattle headage scheme has been replaced in 2001 by the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. A condition of the new scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing.</P>
      <P>The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000 and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum stocking density. My Department will be in contact with the person named shortly with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to area-based compensatory allowance will then be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a period where the incidence of brucellosis was relatively stable at a low level, the situation deteriorated in the period 1996 to 1998. As a consequence I introduced a number of additional remedial measures to the brucellosis eradication programme. These included a statutory one sale, 30 day pre-movement test, the monitoring of cow slaughterings at meat plants, and the replacement of the serum agglutination test on blood samples by the elisa test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the milk ring test is in the process of being replaced by a whey eliza test in the brucellosis laboratory. These additional and improved tests are helping to identify brucellosis <Col N="1647" /> breakdowns at an earlier stage, allowing for earlier intervention in herds and reducing the risk of contiguous spread. The current regime was reviewed during 1999 by an EU food and veterinary office mission and its report broadly endorsed the measures in place.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that as a result of the various initiatives a number of positive factors are emerging to indicate that the incidence of this disease is declining and it is intended that the current level of testing and other control measures be maintained until such time as total eradication is achieved.</P>

    <P>The livestock unit value of dairy cows is obtained by dividing the producer's milk quota in respect of a given calendar year by the national average yield per cow for that year, or by the recorded average milk yield per cow for the year where the producer is in an official milk recording scheme. After taking into account the milk quota of 23,473 gallons in respect of the person named, the livestock unit entitlement available for special beef premium in 2000 is 3.63 livestock units. In 2000, the person named applied for special beef premium on 14 animals with a livestock unit value of 0.6 each. He was paid in respect of the full entitlement of 3.63 livestock units. Animals applied on that are in excess of the applicant's stocking density limit are deemed paid and passports are stamped and punched accordingly, in line with the EU regulations under which special beef premium is paid.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 28 cows and five heifers under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme on 6 February 2001. The herd of the person named was inspected on 2 August 2001 and it was found that two of the cows he had applied on were in fact heifers at the date of application. This meant that his application was in respect of 26 cows and seven heifers. Under clause 20(i) of the terms and conditions of the scheme the number of heifers applied on must not exceed 20% of the total number of animals for which premium is requested. An applicant with 26 eligible cows may apply on up to six heifers under the scheme. Consequently, one of the heifers must be rejected as it exceeds the 20% heifer allowance and a reduction penalty of 3.13% must be applied to the grants due on his remaining eligible animals in accordance with clause 33 of the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named joined REPS in 1996. To remain in the scheme he would have had to submit an application for his second annual payment before the end of his second year, namely by 31 January 1998. However, he did not do so and he was, therefore, deemed to have withdrawn from the scheme. My Department then had to recoup the payment he had received. He was first notified of the debt, which then stood at £5,008.13, in March 1998. My Department has since recovered £1,187.02 from direct payments to which the person named was entitled under other schemes, but as he had not offered or consented to any repayment arrangements my Department was obliged by EU regulations to levy interest on the balance and, as of 1 June 2001, the net amount that he owed stood at £5,163.04.</P>
      <P>In May 2001 the person named wrote to my Department offering to pay off the balance by instalments at the end of each year. In June, my Department replied offering him the option of monthly repayments and pointing out that if he agreed to this and made an initial repayment no further interest would be applied. He has not responded and arrangements have been made to continue recouping the debt from other payments to which he would be entitled. My Department is prepared to accept quarterly payments if the balance of the debt is repaid within four years. The person named should now contact my officials to confirm the arrangement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted his application under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme after the closing date for receipt of applications. In normal circumstances, applications received after the closing date incur a 100% late application penalty. However, the herd of the person named had been depopulated under the disease eradication scheme in September 2000. While it was derestricted in February 2001 animal movement restrictions were in place due to foot and mouth disease and he was, therefore, unable to purchase replacement animals until July 2001. I am, therefore, prepared to accept his application in what were exceptional circumstances.  </P>
      <P>The person named may retain his full suckler cow quota of 16 premium rights for the year 2002. Under EU regulations, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven are required to use at least 90% of the quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>

      <P>The person named claimed a total of 9.48 hectares on his 2000 area aid application. When his application details were entered on the Department's electronic database one parcel overlapped with that of another herdowner and one other parcel was overclaimed. An area of 7.78 hectares was determined which is a difference of 1.94 hectares or 21.85%. Under article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92 when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied in respect of the 2000 beef premium and sheep headage schemes.</P>
      <P>Payments totalling £1,437.42 under the 2000 ewe premium/rural world premium, special beef premium, slaughter premium and sheep headage schemes had issued prior to the area aid over declaration coming to light. As the person named had an entitlement to his ewe premium/rural world premium of £493.85 and slaughter premium of £68.04 only, the difference of £875.53 must be recovered. To date a sum of £786.86 has been recovered from entitlements under the various 2001 schemes leaving a balance of £88.67 to be recovered.

      <P>In 2000 the State Laboratory received approximately 1,500 samples for analysis under the Coroners Acts. Indications are this figure will be exceeded in 2001. The main analyses carried out include ethanol determination, drug screening, quantification and confirmation for prescribed drugs, drugs of abuse and carbon monoxide determination. Samples are also analysed for solvents in cases of suspected volatile inhalation &ndash; toluene and butane &ndash; and in cases of accidental inhalation of gases. The prescribed drug screen can detect over 250 drugs, including methadone and specific analyses are available for cocaine, amphetamines, including Ecstasy, opiates and cannabinoids. These drugs must be quantified and confirmed to a level that will satisfy the scrutiny of a court of law.</P>
      <P>Samples frequently require several different analyses to be carried out due to the prevalence of polydrug use in both the drug abuser and the prescription drug populations. The average number of analyses per sample in 2000 was three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> Post-mortem samples from autopsies are analysed to assist the coroners to establish the cause of death in cases of sudden death. The results of such analyses can indicate if the deceased was taking medication at the time of death, whether a drug overdose was taken or if the deceased was under the influence of alcohol or drugs in cases of fatal road traffic accidents or suicides.</P>
    <P>In the case of simpler analyses, for example, where samples have only to be analysed for Ethanol, the samples are usually returned to coroners, and copied to hospital pathologists, within two to three weeks.</P>
    <P>In the case of more complex analyses, because of the number of discrete steps which must be taken sequentially the average turn around time is now three to four months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is an ongoing high level of inquiry and contact with them about the arrangements. The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioners indicated publicly last week that with a month still to go to the deadline, amounts actually paid to them under the arrangements total over £10 million &ndash; 12.8 million &ndash; in respect of some 300 cases. The Commissioners have stated that previous experience of deadlines suggests that most of those availing of the benefits, offered until 15 <Col N="1656" /> November, will wait until that deadline arrives to pay up. Revenue's media campaign and comments last week were designed to remind people that, even if they do not pay until the deadline, they have work to do in advance if they are not to miss out.</P>
      <P>For those who pay up by 15 November, Revenue have publicised the very real benefits in terms of anonymity, interest and penalties capped at 100% of the tax due together with no investigation for prosecution. Revenue have also warned those thinking of &ldquo;lying low&rdquo; that it will be using its strong new powers which require banks and building societies to provide information about all bogus non resident account holders. Banks and building societies have advertised that they will be co-operating fully with the use of those powers.</P>
      <P>Revenue have stressed that each identified bogus non resident account holder who has not paid up by the deadline will be individually investigated &ndash; no matter how long it takes; and that they will be exposed publicly as tax evaders and made to pay much more in interest and penalties than they would pay now. Some will be investigated for criminal prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The brutality and wickedness of the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 were an affront to humanity. These attacks were such a human tragedy it may seem somehow inappropriate to discuss their economic implications. However, there is no denying that the economic impact of these events will be felt all over the world.</P>
      <P>The exact extent and duration of the economic impact on the United States will very much depend on the ongoing military response and whether this leads to further terrorist activity. It will also depend on the reaction of consumer confidence in the United States to these unfolding events.</P>
      <P>As far as the economic implications of the attacks for Ireland are concerned, because we have an open economy heavily reliant on trade and foreign investment and on international travel and tourism, they will obviously have unfavourable implications for us too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult, just over a month after the event, to assess the full economic impact of the attacks on Ireland's growth and employment. Estimates by market commentators for GNP growth next year vary between 1% and 6%. These estimates are lower than previous fore<Col N="1657" /> casts. This illustrates the degree of uncertainty in the current global economic environment. My Department will as usual publish its estimates for economic growth when the budget is being delivered.</P>
    <P>Recent events underline the need for a prudent approach to the public finances, particularly over the coming months in order to ensure that the economy weathers the present stormy conditions. Looking slightly further ahead, I have no doubt that in the medium term with the right approach, we can pass through these short-term difficulties and achieve satisfactory levels of economic growth which will benefit us all.</P>

      <P>The national development plan is a £40.6 billion &ndash; 51.6 billion &ndash; investment programme in 1999 prices over seven years. Investment is being concentrated on economic and social infrastructure, human resource development, productive sector investment and regional development and rural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investment in economic infrastructure will improve competitiveness and foster more balanced regional development through reducing differences in transport costs and other costs of production between different regions within the State. Investment in social infrastructure, particularly housing and health capital, will contribute <Col N="1658" /> to improvement in the supply of social housing and in the health services for all and reduce social exclusion.</P>
    <P>Investment in employment and human resource measures will increase the quality of the labour force and make it more adaptable through the provision of further education and training; this is essential to achieving the objective of sustainable development and improved competitiveness. Investment in employment and human resources is also being targeted at the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed and is thereby promoting social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Productive sector investment is primarily aimed at consolidating and improving Ireland's competitiveness. This is being achieved through investment in research and development so as to aid the production of higher value added products and services and through support for marketing, foreign direct investment and indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>While all of the investment programmes in the NDP contribute to the objective of balanced regional development, the two regional programmes are specifically targeted on development in the regions. Measures for local infrastructure, local enterprise and social inclusion, including child care are being funded under these programmes. These measures will complement those at national level and will provide a local focus to economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Rural development is being supported through investment measures in the regional programmes and the Common Agriculture Policy rural development programme. These measures will help sustain the rural economy and rural population.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total number of income earners on tax record whose main source of income is from PAYE sources is estimated at 1,613,100 in the current year. This number includes some 107,000 who are also required to complete self-assessment income tax returns in respect of income derived from sources other than employment subject to PAYE. A further 222,000 income earners whose main source of income is derived from self-employment or investments are also subject to self-assessment. The figures for the numbers of PAYE and self-employed taxpayers given are projected estimates and are subject to revision. A married couple that has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
      <P>Revenue are satisfied that there has been a significant improvement in tax compliance since the introduction of self-assessment, and particularly in recent years. Revenue is working hard to continue that improvement with my full support. In the 1999 Finance Act I brought forward a major package of powers to underpin Revenue's audit effectiveness and I understand it is actively using those powers to tackle non-compliance. I have also recently sanctioned a major increase in its staffing resource. I understand that some 200 additional Revenue auditors have been appointed in recent months.</P>
      <P>Revenue has also put in place improved arrangements to ensure that early and effective action is taken in relation to taxpayers on self-assessment who fail to file their returns and pay their tax liabilities on time. While there is no reason to be complacent about tax compliance there have undoubtedly been real improvements in recent years. The self-assessment system, by allowing Revenue staff to be moved from processing activities to audit and enforcement, has contributed significantly to that improvement.</P>

Public transport should be used wherever possible and use of private cars by civil servants for official business should be used only where, in the particular circumstances, no suitable public transport is available, public transport is available only at equal or greater cost or the use of public transport would result in the loss of official time which it is necessary to avoid.</P>

The mileage rates are set following consultation and agreement with the Civil Service unions under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.

      <P>As evidenced by our record to date, and continuing efforts in this regard, this Government has given a consistently high priority to tackling poverty. <Col N="1661" /> Actions have been taken, and continue to be taken, over a number of fronts. These include continued strong growth in employment, total employment increased by 21% between 1997 and 2000. This increase has been associated with a 53% fall in the unemployment rate over the same period which reduced from 10.3% in 1997 to 4.3% in 2000. By the second quarter of 2001, it had further decreased to just 3.7% with a long-term unemployment rate of 1.2%. Employment is expected to continue to grow, albeit at a lower level than in recent years; the introduction of a minimum wage which was increased in July of this year to £4.70 (5.97) per hour and will be further increased to £5.00 (6.35) per hour from 1 October next year; personal/PAYE allowances/credits have been increased and standard rated; as a result of the increases, the threshold below which no income tax is paid has been increased over the past four years from £71 (90.15) per week to £144 (182.84) per week. The increases also mean that the number of income earners outside the tax net now stands at 32.6% of all income earners as compared with a figure of 24.9% before the 1998 budget, that is, tax year 1996-97. There are now almost 613,000 outside the tax net as compared with 346,000 before the 1998 budget. The standard rating has equalised the value of personal allowances for all taxpayers regardless of their income, thereby increasing the equity of the system; a PPF commitment that, over time, all those on the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net. As already stated, the present threshold is £144 (182.84) per week. There have been unprecedented increases in social welfare payment rates. For instance, the personal rate of old age contributory pension has already increased by 36% since 1997 from £78 (99.04) per week to £106 (134.59) per week now &ndash; more than achieving the commitment in our action programme of reaching £100 (126.97) per week by 2002. Over the same period, the lowest rates of social welfare have increased by 28% from £65.40 (83.04) per week to £84 (106.66) per week with a commitment in the PPF for substantial progress towards a figure of £100 (126.97) per week. There has been a major programme of investment in child benefit, widely acknowledged as the most effective means of tackling child poverty. Current commitments mean the rate of payment of child benefit will have almost quadrupled to £117.50 (149.19) and £146 (185.38) per month by 2003 compared to the position in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These and other actions across the key headings identified in the national anti-poverty strategy of educational disadvantage, unemployment, income adequacy, urban disadvantage and rural poverty have contributed to a real improvement in the living standards of all in our society. This is evidenced by the very dramatic progress which has been made in reducing the levels of consistent poverty. The most recent data published by the ESRI indicate that the numbers experiencing consistent poverty at the 60% income line, that <Col N="1662" /> is, having less than 60% of average household disposable income and experiencing enforced basic deprivation, had fallen from 15% in 1994 to 8% by 1998. In light of the progress in improving living standards across the board since then and, in particular, the continued increase in employment, it is expected that the position will have further improved in the intervening years. Clearly, we are well on the way to achieving our target of reducing levels of consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004 and, indeed, this target will again fall to be considered as part of the ongoing review of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total Revenue debt as at 31 May 2001 amounted to £1,176 million &ndash; 1,493.2 million &ndash; which is an increase of £121 million  &ndash;  153.6 million &ndash; in absolute terms over the previous year's debt. The debt as a percentage of net collection remained at the same level as the previous year at 6%. The increase in the debt results primarily from the substantial increase in the volume and value of Revenue's business in recent years &ndash; gross Revenue receipts increased by almost £10 billion &ndash; 12.7 billion &ndash; or 53% between 1997 and 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> Given this increase it follows that more tax will be in the course of collection at any particular time. The current nature of the increase in the debt is borne out by the fact that Revenue estimate that more of the total debt will be collected &ndash; £744 million, or 944.7 million &ndash; 63% &ndash; out of the total of £1,176 million, or 1,493.2 million, as at May 2001, as against £559 million, or 709.8 million &ndash; 53% &ndash; out of the total of £1,055 million, or 1339.6 million, in 2000. The balance of the debt on record which is not expected to be collected is old or estimated debt or relates to firms that have gone out of business.</P>
    <P>While the outstanding debt on record does not represent an increase in tax evasion, it is the case that there have been significant disclosures of tax evasion in recent years. Revenue have assured me that they are using the new powers given to them in the Finance Act, 1999, and additional staff to pursue vigorously all the investigations they have launched to deal with this evasion.</P>
    <P>Revenue's Statement of Strategy 2001-2003 published in July of this year sets out a comprehensive programme of action that will be undertaken by Revenue to maintain the significant progress they have made in recent years in curbing the debt over the next three years. The debt has fallen from £3,500 million &ndash; 4,444 million &ndash; in 1988 to £1,176 million &ndash; 1,493.2 million &ndash; as at 31 May last. Revenue has set itself the objective of eliminating debt more than six years old, except where it is subject to proceedings that cannot be brought to a rapid conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate to compare the numbers of prosecutions for serious tax evasion with those in the social welfare area. Prosecutions for serious tax evasion are normally criminal prosecutions demanding a very high level of proofs. Since 1996 16 such prosecutions have been completed and prison sentences &ndash; some suspended &ndash; were handed down in seven of these cases. Revenue are increasing their efforts to secure prosecutions in appropriate cases and a new prosecutions division is being set up for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Social welfare prosecutions are more akin to Revenue summary prosecutions for non-filing of tax returns. In the year 2000 Revenue issued warnings of such prosecutions in 8,190 cases. Legal proceedings were initiated in 2,676 cases. There were 1,017 convictions in non-filing cases in 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, I made significant changes to the stamp duty regime on transfers of residential property arising from the recommendations of the third Bacon report into the housing market. These resulted in reductions in stamp duty rates for first-time buyers in respect of houses up to £300,000 &ndash; 381,000 &ndash; in price, while other owner-occupiers also benefited from the rates revision at the lower end of the market.</P>
      <P>That Act introduced a three-tiered stamp duty structure for first-time buyers, owner-occupiers other than first-time buyers, and investors. I increased the exemption from stamp duty from £60,000 &ndash; 76,200 &ndash; to £150,000 &ndash;  180,500 &ndash; in the case of first-time buyers and for other owner-occupiers to £100,000  &ndash;  127,000 &ndash; and reduced the stamp duty rates on transfers of residential property at the lower end of the market for first time buyers and other owner-occupiers in excess of these thresholds. In particular, the revised regime is structured to facilitate those who are trying to buy their first home and who are faced with particular difficulties in the market at the present time. Many first time owner-occupier buyers are now either exempt from stamp duty or pay at a reduced rate. However, owner-occupiers, who are not first-time buyers, also benefit generally from the revised stamp duty rates, as I have already indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act introduced a flat 9% stamp duty rate on all categories of investors buying new or second-hand residential property. This did constitute an increase in stamp duty payable by those persons in respect of new property and in respect of second-hand property over £500,000 &ndash; 635,000. However, in the light of developments in the housing market since last year, the Government decided to reduce the rate of stamp duty for investors in new property from this flat 9% and an amendment to this effect was introduced on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001, which applies to conveyances made on and from 27 February 2001. However, the investor rate for second <Col N="1665" /> hand properties remained at 9%. This change to the stamp duty regime leaves the investor rate unchanged in the second-hand market while reducing it for new property, thus providing a supply incentive in this area. Limiting the concession to new housing maintains the relative advantage of first-time purchasers in the second-hand market which accounts for two-thirds of first-time purchaser transactions.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the tax treatment of the private rented accommodation sector is that the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, abolished the deductibility of interest for borrowings in respect of private rented residential accommodation purchased on or after 23 April 1998, subject to certain transitional provisions. The Act represented a significant part of the Government's package of measures aimed at addressing problems in the housing market. This approach was adopted on the basis of the report on house prices prepared by Peter Bacon and Associates. The measures in the Act were framed to address the situation identified in the report that investors were to some extent replacing first time buyers in the market, a development which was contrary to the thrust of housing policy over recent decades.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to introduce any further changes to the stamp duty structure, nor in the provisions relating to interest deductibility on borrowings by investors. However, the position is being kept under continuous review in the light of developments in the housing market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for income tax relief at the marginal rate of tax for expenditure incurred on health care. This includes expenditure incurred, net of any amounts received or receivable from any public or local authority, for example, health board, or any insurance policy, or any other source, on the supply, maintenance, repair of any medical, surgical, dental or nursing appliance used on the advice of a medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>A remote control bed purchased on the advice of a medical practitioner would fall into this category. Relief may be claimed by an individual in respect of such expenditure incurred in respect of the individual him/herself, or incurred on behalf of a dependant. A dependant includes a spouse, child or other relative.</P>
      <P>In the case of a relative, for the years up to and including the tax year 2000-01, the claimant is only entitled to claim relief in respect of health expenses incurred in respect of a relative for whom he or she is entitled to the dependent relative tax allowance under the provisions of section 466 for the relevant year(s). For 2001 and following years, this condition no longer applies. Once the relative is a dependant of the claimant, that is, a relative of the individual, or of the individual's spouse, who is incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself; the widowed father or widowed mother of the individual or of the individual's spouse, whether incapacitated or not, or a son or daughter of the individual who resides with the individual and on whose services the individual, by reason of old age or infirmity, is compelled to depend, he or she can claim relief in respect of health expenses incurred on behalf of the dependent relative.</P>
      <P>It is not clear from the Deputy's question when or by whom the expenditure was incurred. If the expenditure on the purchase of the remote control bed was incurred by the elderly couple themselves and they are paying tax, then income tax relief under section 469 Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, may be claimed by the couple.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, the expenditure was incurred by the couple's daughter, and she pays tax, she may be entitled to income tax relief under section 469 of Taxes Consolidation Act. If the expenditure was incurred prior to 6 April 2001, she would have to have been entitled to the dependent relative allowance in respect of her mother in order to qualify for income tax relief on the expenditure. A claim form has been forwarded to the individual mention by Deputy.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 has as the following main objectives: continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth; consolidating and improving Ireland's international competitiveness; fostering balanced regional development; promoting social inclusion.</P>
      <P>The NDP is a seven year plan which is being delivered through three national programmes &ndash; economic and social infrastructure, employment and human resource development and productive sector investment &ndash; two regional programmes and the peace programme. In addition, there is the Common Agricultural Policy rural development programme which is being co-funded by FEOGA guarantee funds.</P>
      <P>With less than two years of a seven year plan completed it is too early to measure the specific contribution of the plan to the above objectives. However there has been very good progress in the areas of investment which are central to the achievement of these objectives. In particular investment in infrastructure under the economic and social infrastructure programme is well on target; this programme contributes to all of the above objectives through major improvements in our transport and environmental infrastructure, public housing investment and health services capital.</P>
      <P>The employment and human resources programme is also generally on target; this programme is contributing to the development of our human resources which are essential to sustainable development and improved competitiveness. The human resource development programme is also targeting the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed and is thereby promoting social inclusion.</P>
      <P>Progress under the productive sector programme has been slow reflecting a general slowdown in the international investment climate with a consequential adverse effect on private sector investment. The two regional programmes are making good progress despite the problems which foot and mouth disease created for the delivery of the agriculture measures in the programmes. The measures in these programmes for local infrastructure, local enterprise and social inclusion complement those in the national programmes and are contributing to all of the objectives of the NDP and particularly those of balanced regional development and promotion of social inclusion.</P>

This sum is comprised of the net receipts of the Telecom Éireann flotation and a contribution of 1% of GNP in 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>A slightly broader measure of debt which is used for the purposes of international comparison is the general Government debt-GDP ratio. By this measure, our debt stood at 38.6% at end 2000 compared with 49.3% at end 1999. The most recent projection for the general Government debt-GDP ratio at end 2001 is 34.2%. This projection was prepared for the European Commission at end August in the context of the excessive deficit return required under the stability and growth pact. However, due to the reduced budget surplus, the outturn is now expected to be slightly higher than this. A revised projection will be published on budget day.</P>

      <P>At the informal ECOFIN in Liège on 21 September 2001, I and my fellow Economic and Finance Ministers issued a statement on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks on the US. The statement included a commitment to pursue sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, aimed at fostering growth, employment and competitiveness and maintaining price stability. The statement made clear that this together with the fall in inflation, recent tax reductions and favourable financing conditions will create conditions for a gradual strengthening of domestic demand in the EU as a whole.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above statement, the Finance Ministers also announced in Liège a list of actions to combat the financing of terrorism, I will make a copy of both statements available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards what we in Ireland can do, we need to remain committed to implementing the full terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in order to avoid any weakening of Ireland's international competitiveness. We must sustain investor and business confidence through continued responsible management of the public finances and ensure the full implementation of the national development plan which will help ensure that our infrastructure, both physical and human is able to meet the considerable challenges of the new economic environment post 11 September. I am confident that in the medium term, as the global economic environment recovers, we can achieve satisfactory levels of economic growth which will benefit us all.</P>

      <P>The fundamental requirement for relief from tax under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax <Col N="1673" /> Concessions) Regulations, 1994, is that the disabled person meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for relief without the issue of a primary medical certificate. In cases where the issue of a certificate is refused, it is open for the applicant to appeal this refusal to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the administration of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, that the number of applications processed by them is as follows:</P>

    <P>1,132 of the applications processed so far this year are from first time applicants. It is estimated that the number of applications processed during 2001 will be of the order of 3,800.</P>
    <P>Application for relief in respect of a vehicle can be made only at intervals of two years or more. Based on the number of persons who are claiming relief from excise duty on fuel on an ongoing basis, it is estimated that some 7,500 people with disabilities are currently actively participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to others who may be seeking admission to the scheme I have no indication as to the number of applicants involved. While definitions of disability vary, I have been informed that there are up to 360,000 in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with less severe medical conditions than those which are covered by the scheme and persons with medical conditions which are not covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme.</P>

      <P>Funding has been indicated by my Department under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, to each of the health boards. This takes account of the regional requirements reflected in the overall plan in relation to the S&amp;E and BMW regions. As the health services are primarily <Col N="1674" /> administered on the health board structure, the allocation and expenditure of NDP funding to individual counties is a matter for each board.</P>
      <P>In strategically managing the NDP, my Department approves with each board major or medium projects on an individual basis. Smaller projects or other capital expenditure relating, for example, to equipment, refurbishment or health and safety works are normally agreed with boards on a more global funding approach within individual healthcare programmes. My Department does not routinely collate funding or expenditure details by county.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I have referred the Deputy's query to the chief executive officers of the health boards within the S&amp;E region and have asked them to supply the information requested direct to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>The removal of persons from waiting lists may be due to a number of factors such as ongoing validation exercises by health agencies, as recommended by the review group on waiting lists in 1998, removal due to medical or other circumstances and the impact of procedures funded under the waiting list initiative.

      <P>I am delighted to inform the Deputy that since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children at the end of January 2000, there have been significant developments in the area of primary care and additional resources have been provided for this purpose. These developments will continue in the context of the new Health Strategy and associated Primary Care Strategy which are due to be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The pilot out-of-hours project, CAREDOC, in the South-Eastern Health Board, was already under way at that time and a similar project in the North-Eastern Health Board also started in that year. Both projects have been independently evaluated and the report shows that they are providing appropriate additional out-of-hours general practitioner services to the regions they serve. The recommendations highlighted in the report have been incorporated into the operation plans for the North-Western and Southern Health Board projects &ndash; the Southern Health Board project commenced last week. These co-operatives provide significant benefits to both patients and doctors concerned.</P>
      <P>Further, in recognition of the role that information and communications technology can and should play in general practice and primary care I have supported a number of initiatives in this area. These include further funding for the National GPIT Group, the roll out of a national IT training programme, and the further development of the national electronics Healthlink project. I have also provided extra funding to the Irish College of General Practitioners to enable them undertake additional education and training programmes which will ultimately translate into better patient care.</P>
      <P>From April 2001 all medical card holders are eligible for free nicotine replacement therapy. From 1 March 2000 the second phase of the doubling of the income limits for persons aged 70 years and over in respect of the granting of medical cards came into effect. The third and final phase was effective from 1 March 2001 and, with effect from 1 July 2001, all persons in this age category have an automatic entitlement to medical cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the strategic planning and development of the health service. I am continuing the development and reform of health services begun by my colleague and predecessor in this Government. The following is an outline of some of the key developments in acute hospital services since this Government came into office.</P>
      <P>This Government has overseen significant increases in hospital activity levels. In particular there has been a 29% increase in day care activity in hospitals since this Government came into office. The hospital system has continued its high productivity performance in January to June 2001 by recording an overall rise of 5.1% activity increase, including almost 11% growth in day cases. This translates into an extra 22,000 cases treated over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Some £1 billion, 1.27 billion, has been provided under the national development plan for the development of hospital infrastructure. This will allow for the provision of major developments in the acute hospital sector in every region of the country.</P>
      <P>I provided a £32 million, 40.631 million, investment package in 2000-2001 which targeted a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants and the contracting of additional private nursing home places.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase of about 25% in the numbers employed in the health service since this Government came into office. We now have about 83,000 wholetime equivalent staff working in the health service. This includes an additional 250 consultants, 4,000 nurses, 2,000 paramedical workers and support staff for these professionals in our health system.</P>
      <P>Over £60 million, 76.184 million, has been allocated under the National Cancer Strategy since 1997 and an additional 57 consultants, together with support staff, have been approved. Funding has also been provided in the current year to enable a number of health agencies to develop centres of excellence for the care and treatment of symptomatic breast disease. These developments are in addition to the services being provided by BreastCheck, which was launched in October 2000. Up to 30 June last, over 43,000 women had attended for screening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now spending an additional £38 million, 48.250 million, on cardiovascular and cardiac surgery services. Some £34.5 million, 43.805 million, has been allocated this year to provide additional procedures to those on waiting lists. Significant decreases have taken place in the number of patients waiting in the target specialities since June 2000; the number awaiting cardiac surgery is down by 52%, gynaecology is down by 35%, ophthalmology is down by 23%, ortho<Col N="1681" /> paedics is down by 14% and ENT is down by 30%.</P>
    <P>I have provided for additional investment in areas such as anaesthetics, renal services, ambulance/pre hospital care, heart/lung transplant service, laboratory services and hospital accreditation.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review has focused primarily on the emerging needs to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The review of bed capacity will inform the forthcoming Health Strategy.</P>
    <P>The Health Strategy will provide a framework for growth and development of our health services over the coming years. In addition to issues of capacity of services, the strategy will address issues relating to reform and modernisation of the health system. The strategy will outline the direction and scale of development planned in a number of service and professional areas for example acute hospital bed capacity, primary health care, medical manpower, nursing etc. In addition, the strategy will include a plan covering the actions required for its implementation in the short, medium and long-term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, launched in July 1999, provides a strategic framework to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases in Ireland. The implementation of its 211 recommendations has commenced and will ultimately lead to a reduction of the incidence of premature death from cardiovascular diseases in Ireland from the position in 1998 of twice the EU average. At the launch of the strategy the Department set a medium-term objective to bring our levels of premature death from cardiovascular diseases in line with the EU <Col N="1683" /> average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the EU by 2010.</P>
      <P>As a measure of the Government's commitment to the implementation of this report, structures were put in place at national, regional and local level to drive the implementation process, including the establishment of a heart health task force, an advisory forum on cardiovascular health, and an interdivisional working group within my Department. These structures have further been complemented by regional co-ordinating committees under each health board to give overall direction and impetus to the planned and structured implementation of the report. A total sum of £27 million, 34 million euros has been allocated towards the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy, £12 million, 15 million euros in 2000 and £15 million, 19 million euros, in 2001. This funding has supported a wide range of additional regional services, initiatives and a total of 288 posts were filled in the year 2000. I will shortly publish a detailed progress report setting out national and regional developments since July 1999, under the strategy. The main national developments to date include a national media campaign &ldquo;Ireland needs a Change of Heart&rdquo;, which includes an all-island physical activity campaign, &ldquo;get a life, get active&rdquo;, and other health promotion campaigns such as NICO, an anti-smoking initiative, were developed and launched.</P>
      <P>Nicotine replacement therapy, was introduced to GMS patients from April 2001. Some £3 million has been set aside under GMS for this initiative in 2001. A steering group has been established to advise on the first phase of a secondary prevention programme in general practice. The National Ambulance Advisory Council has been replaced, on a statutory basis, by the Pre-hospital Emergency Care Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A joint working chaired by Comhairle na nOspidéal produced an interim report in May 2001 on additional consultant cardiologist requirements for 2002 so that funding could be sought to fill the first of these posts during 2002. Specific developments included extension of the catheterisation laboratory in Cork University Hospital, a pacemaker service in the South-Eastern Health Board region, angioplasty services in the Mid-Western Health Board and provision of diagnostic coronary angiography at Sligo General Hospital on a sessional basis. Chest pain assessment facilities were considerably enhanced in the ERHA region. All boards have begun developing cardiac rehabilitation in acute hospitals. An additional £5 million &ndash; £4.5 million to the ERHA for adult and paediatric surgery and £500,000 to the Southern Health Board &ndash; for additional cardiac activity in Cork University Hospital, has been provided in 2001 to continue and progress the reduction of cardiac surgery waiting lists. The objective is to guarantee public hospital patients access to cardiac surgery within an average waiting period of six months from <Col N="1684" /> diagnosis. An additional £2.58 million, £2.08 million to the ERHA and £500,000 to the South Victoria Hospital, Cork, has been provided to address cardiovascular disease and to enhance the provision of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1994 and 1999, the latest date for which mortality figures are available, there has been a significant decrease in cancer deaths in both men, 3.5%, and women, 3.6%.</P>
      <P>More than £60 million, 76.184 million, has been allocated under the National Cancer Strategy since 1997 including £18.549 million, 23,565 million, in the current year. Among the developments made possible by this additional funding has been the approval of the appointment of an additional 57 additional consultant posts in key areas, such as medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care, together with support staff.</P>
      <P>Phase one of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was launched in October 2000 covering the functional areas of Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards. This programme is currently available to all women living in the phase one areas aged between 50 and 64 years. It is estimated that there are approximately 140,000 eligible women living within the phase one area of the programme and up to the 30 June 2001, BreastCheck had invited 43,283 women to attend for screening. BreastCheck is currently in consultation with the other health boards concerning the roll out of the programme nationwide. I will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to national coverage as soon as is practicably possible, having regard, in particular, to the experience gained in putting phase one of the programme in place.</P>
      <P>Funding totalling £4.35 million, 5.52 million, has been provided this year to enable a number of health agencies to commence the development of centres of excellence for the care and treatment of symptomatic breast disease in line with the recommendations of the report on the &ldquo;Development of services for Symptomatic Breast Disease&rdquo; which was published in March 2000. These developments are in addition to the services being provided by BreastCheck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening Programme was launched in October 2000, covering the Mid-Western Health Board area. As with BreastCheck, the experience gained from phase <Col N="1685" /> one will facilitate the planning and organising of the roll out of this programme. Currently, the chief executive officers of the health boards are involved in an examination of the feasibility of extending the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Research projects are also being funded under a tripartite agreement between my Department, the Health Department in Northern Ireland and the National Cancer Institute in the USA. In addition, an all-Ireland cancer incidence and mortality report was launched on 1 May 2001.</P>
    <P>I will continue to be advised by the National Cancer Forum regarding the planning, development and co-ordination of cancer services for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is currently a wide range of structures in place to monitor and evaluate productivity throughout the health sector at both national and health board levels. These structures include a variety of mechanisms such as health strategies, programme expenditure reviews, service plans with performance indicators and audits by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The delivery of health care services is under continuous review and evaluation through a variety of mechanisms by my Department. One such mechanism is the Casemix Programme. The Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, whereby public hospitals record and report on their activity levels, together with the specialty costs programme, form the basis for the Casemix programme which now operates in over 30 hospitals and continues to grow. The purpose of Casemix is to assist hospitals to define their products, measure their productivity, and assess quality. Services cannot be planned and managed without knowing who the customers are, what they want and what the cost of providing such services is. Casemix is one of the best management tools available for monitoring and evaluation of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collection of relevant, accurate and timely information is critical to assessing productivity in the health sector. There is an ongoing development of information communications technology aimed at enhancing the delivery and cost effectiveness through integrated care processes. These developments are contributing to the efficiency of service provision and the provision of better management information to assist in the pursuit of further cost effectiveness. The national development plan provides for increased investment and development of these systems. In <Col N="1686" /> addition, my Department is currently preparing a national health information strategy.</P>
    <P>In order to realise the full potential of the information being collected throughout the health sector, systems and processes need to be in place to ensure that it is utilised for planning and accountability purposes. Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996, health boards are required to submit an annual service plan to my Department setting out the level of service that they will deliver for the financial determination they have received. The service planning discipline and structures now in place in health agencies and the ongoing developments in this area continue to enhance the delivery of health care services. Service plans are not just about financial accountability in the narrow sense but also provide an opportunity to show how we are progressing towards our goals.</P>
    <P>Health is a very expensive commodity, and it is incumbent on my Department to ensure the best possible use of public funds in the pursuit of health and social gain. An important ingredient in health care costs is the materials and supplies which are required in the operation of the health care system. The Healthcare Materials Management Board was established to ensure that the strategies outlined in the report of the materials management advisory group are implemented in the most effective and practical manner. This structure aims to guide health agencies in adopting best practice in this area to ensure that value for money is being achieved in each agency and through the combined purchasing power of all the health agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government decision of 25 March 1997, approved proposals for a process of expenditure reviews aimed at providing a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme and providing a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between expenditure programmes. Reviews of the intellectual disability programme, the dental treatment services scheme and the nursing home subvention expenditure scheme have been completed.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, you will be aware that I have initiated the development of the new National Health Strategy which is being informed by the Value for Money, VFM, audit of the health services. Following on from the Government's review of its Action Programme for the Millennium, consultants were appointed to carry out a comprehensive VFM audit of the health services. The consultants were asked to look back on the provision of health services over the past ten years so as to examine, among other things, trends in demand, resource inputs and outputs and differentials across health boards and hospitals over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>A special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on &ldquo;Internal Audits in the Health Boards&rdquo; was presented to Dáil Éireann in 2001. The report made recommendations on how the boards internal audit function should change. <Col N="1687" /> Arising from this report a review group was established by the chief executive officer's of the health boards-authority to address the issues raised by the report. This involved an Comptroller and Auditor General's examination of how the function of internal audits would be enhanced and to develop an outline structure, role, strategy and standards.</P>
    <P>My Department has welcomed both reports and will actively promote continuing development and best standards in the area of internal audits.</P>
    <P>The new Health Strategy is expected to be completed shortly. It will set out how we see the health services developing over the next seven to ten years. It will set out our new health goals and how we intend to pursue them. The strategy will have regard to the need for an effective and productive health care system that is truly people centred.</P>

An extra £1 million, 1.2697 million, in 2000 &ndash; and £2 million, 2.539 million, in 2001, was made available in support of carers. A portion of this funding would have been used to supply home-based aids.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have initiated a wide range of measures to improve our Accident and Emergency services. This includes the provision of a £32 million investment package aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. The investment package has been targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of additional Accident and Emergency consultants to ensure that patients have improved access <Col N="1688" /> to a prompt senior clinical decision making service.</P>
      <P>Funding has also been provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted more than 700 beds under the initiative last winter and this helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospital. Funding has also been allocated to the ERHA and each health board for the contracting of private nursing home places for the final three months of this year.</P>
      <P>I have also provided funding to the ERHA and the health boards to support a further range of initiatives in Accident and Emergency departments. These include £5.19 million towards the development of Accident and Emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital, the provision of minor injuries units in Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St. James's and Tallaght hospitals, the development of the Accident and Emergency department at the Mater Hospital, the extension to the Accident and Emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital, the development of pilot services for deep venous thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital, the provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital, the provision of a pilot discharge lounge in Beaumont Hospital, the recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel at Accident and Emergency sites in the eastern region, the development of a new Accident and Emergency department at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, the development of a new Accident and Emergency department at The Children's Hospital, Temple Street, the planning of a new Accident and Emergency department for Cork University Hospital, the development of the Accident and Emergency department at Galway University Hospital, the development of the Accident and Emergency department at Castlebar General Hospital, the development of the Accident and Emergency department at Tullamore General Hospital, the development of a new Accident and Emergency department at Portlaoise General Hospital, the appointment of a design team for the development of a new Accident and Emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital, the upgrading of Accident and Emergency facilities at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Monaghan General Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to undertake a review of the structure, operation and staffing of Accident and Emergency services and departments with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. The review, which is at an advanced stage, will inform future policy decisions on the further development of Accident and Emergency services. I am satisfied that the initiatives which I have outlined will help <Col N="1689" /> to relieve pressures on Accident and Emergency services. I accept that there is still a need for additional targeted investment to the service and this will be addressed as a priority in the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Programme, commenced in February 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. BreastCheck is currently in consultation with the health boards concerning the roll out of the programme nationwide. I will support BreastCheck in moving to national coverage as soon as is practicably possible having regard, in particular, to the experience gained in putting phase one of the programme in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase one of the National Cervical Screening Programme was launched in October 2000 covering the Mid-Western Health Board area. As with BreastCheck, the experience gained from phase one will facilitate the process of planning and <Col N="1690" /> organising the roll out of this programme. Currently the chief executive officers of the health boards are involved in an examination of the feasibility and implications of extending the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the techniques used in screening for cancer are proved to be medically effective and accurate before screening programmes, covering large segments of the population, are introduced. Reliable screening techniques for breast cancer and cervical cancer are now well established internationally.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the question of introducing screening programmes for other forms of cancer under review, having regard to the most up to date advice on the medical effectiveness of the available screening techniques. In this context, the National Cancer Forum, which advises me on all aspects of cancer services, has recently established a sub-group on cancer screening. This sub-group will examine the issues and ensure that all relevant research is taken into account before making recommendations on the introduction of new screening programmes and techniques.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that as a first step in the donor selection process the Irish Blood Transfusion Service elicits a detailed donor history to detect any underlying disease or illness which may prevent a person from donating. A range of tests is conducted on donations in line with leading transfusion services internationally. Where test results indicate a possible health problem, the donors are contacted and provided with information concerning test results and where appropriate they are referred to their own medical advisers.</P>
      <P>My Department has not asked the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to conduct additional screening of the kind referred to by the Deputy. If the IBTS were to provide such a service, persons who consider that they may have a medical condition or illness might donate in order to obtain a medical diagnosis and this could have detrimental implications for the safety of the blood supply.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement has now been reached at the <Col N="1692" /> Health Employers' Service Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, an accord has been reached between the Dental Council, the two dental schools and hospitals in Dublin and Cork and the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry to establish specialist dental training in this country on a sound footing. The Dublin Dental Hospital, Trinity College and health boards have advertised a specialist training programme in orthodontics and six dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training this month. Furthermore three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics. This brings the total number of dentists in orthodontic specialist training to nine and discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following progress with their developments under the initiative: two additional consultant orthodontists, four specialists in orthodontics, one dental team and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited. Interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board, ECAHB, have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised. A competition to fill the post of dental hygienist in the ECAHB has been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidate is currently in train. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future. A six surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational. Three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards. My Department has recently approved a proposal from the Mid-Western Health Board to engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork Dental School to facilitate <Col N="1693" /> the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have also funded the development of a new regional orthodontic unit at Dundalk, recently operational, and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed earlier this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of AIDS cases in all transmission categories has declined since the mid 1990s. This reduction can be primarily attributed to the use of the highly effective anti-retroviral treatments or triple therapy, which prevents or delays the onset of AIDS in HIV positive patients. The most recent data published by the National Disease Surveillance Centre shows that the total number of AIDS cases declined to 21 cases in 2000 compared to 41 in 1999. This brings the total number of reported AIDS cases to 707. There were 13 AIDS related deaths reported in 2000 compared with 17 in 1999. This brings the total number of reported AIDS related deaths to 362.</P>
      <P>HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, is now seen as a chronic rather than a fatal illness. However, there is no room for complacency given the recent increase in the reported number of HIV cases. These statistics show that 342 new HIV cases were reported during 2000, an increase of 64% over the previous year. Increases were recorded in all at risk groups.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to giving HIV and AIDS high priority. Since the publication of the first National AIDS Strategy Committee's report in 1992 significant additional funding has been provided to health boards for the development of services. As well as providing primary and hospital care for those infected health boards also fund a range of voluntary agencies involved in HIV-AIDS prevention and care. Since I came into office a programme for antenatal testing for HIV has been introduced. Treatment is available to pregnant women which greatly reduces the chances of their baby being infected with HIV. The programme is being monitored and evaluated to ensure an uptake rate of at least 90%. Preliminary results show that some health boards have already achieved this target while others need to improve the uptake rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National AIDS Strategy Committee, which is chaired by my colleague Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, published &ldquo;AIDS Strategy <Col N="1694" /> 2000&rdquo; in June 2000. This document sets out a number of recommendations for action over the next five years. The committee has three sub-committees &ndash; education and prevention, surveillance and care and management. A multi-sectoral approach has been adopted by the committee and its sub-committees, which are representative of the main statutory and voluntary agencies working in the HIV-AIDS area. They also include people who are HIV positive. These committees will drive the implementation of the recommendations. The three sub-committees meet regularly and progress has been made in all areas. Case based reporting was introduced in July of this year and this will improve surveillance of HIV. New consultant appointments in the Western Health Board and in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area will be made in the coming year. Education and prevention initiatives will continue.</P>
    <P>HIV is a preventable illness and education and awareness are the most effective tools in the fight against infection. The links between strategies to combat HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections are important because of STIs being recognised as co-factors in the transmission of HIV. Despite the information available to young people, however, the incidence of all major sexually transmitted infections is increasing and this is obviously of serious concern. The National AIDS Strategy Committee has broadened its remit to cover policy in relation to STIs and it is working on improving the present systems of surveillance and management of these conditions. One of the main messages in education and awareness programmes is that the use of condoms can significantly reduce the risk of infection and transmission.</P>
    <P>The education and prevention sub-committee is developing a position paper on the actions required to improve education and awareness and on who should be targeted by these actions. The committee is examining the settings for action including schools, leisure, out of school and any other locations where young people, in particular, may be targeted. This paper will be prepared by the end of the year and it will be the basis for the development of further focused actions. In the meantime, programmes which have been evaluated as having a positive impact will continue. This would include &ldquo;convenience advertising&rdquo; which involves placing specific messages in toilet and washrooms areas of third level colleges, pool halls and STI clinics. Leaflets and brochures giving the facts about AIDS and how it is transmitted will continue to be distributed. Programmes especially aimed at the gay community will continue to create a greater awareness among these groups of the fact that unprotected sexual intercourse is one of the main routes through which HIV is transmitted. Methadone substitution programmes will also continue as a major part of the strategy aimed at reducing the incidence of HIV among injecting drug users. In addition, through the national youth health <Col N="1695" /> programme, the health promotion unit of my Department continues to support training for youth leaders in the HIV-AIDS education resource pack &ldquo;knowledge is power&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>An annual &ldquo;Activities Report on the Irish Psychiatric Services&rdquo; is produced by the Health Research Board. The latest published report is for 1999. This report states that the number of long stay psychiatric patients &ndash; defined as in excess of five years &ndash; in 1999 was 1,842. The number of long stay patients who were discharged from psychiatric hospitals in 1999 was 286. This figure also includes some long stay patients who may have died in this period. The number of long stay patients who were readmitted to hospital is not available. In 1998 the number of long stay patients was 2,054 and the number of long stay patients discharged, including deaths, was 255.</P>
      <P>More than half the patients who are in psychiatric hospitals longer than five years are over 65. As part of the Government's commitment to improving health services for older persons, the number of psychiatric teams specifically concerned with later life psychiatry has been increased in recent years. In 2001, £1.87 million is being provided towards the provision of additional consultants in old age psychiatry. Integration of community and hospital-based psychiatric services with geriatric medicine to provide comprehensive and appropriate packages for older people is progressing. Other steps being taken to improve services for this group of patients include rehabilitation, retraining and the reinstatement of life skills, de-designation of wards and transfer to more appropriate care settings.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remaining group of long-stay patients, those under 65, each health board plans to transfer such patients to community-based or other alternative facilities appropriate to their needs as part of the modernisation of the mental health services.</P>

      <P>Negotiations between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation covered a range of issues including their opposition to the principle of granting medical cards to persons without consideration of their means. Agreement was reached under several headings which covered fees payable in respect of various patient categories and allowances in respect of practice support, both in the areas of staff and equipment.</P>
      <P>The capitation rate now payable is a negotiated figure which reflects the outcome of the industrial relations discussions between the two parties. The differing capitation rates reflect the workload expected for the various patient groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In examining life expectancy rates for males and females, it is important to recognise that health status and mortality rates are influenced by several factors. These include people's natural endowment; the physical and emotional nurturing they receive, the lifestyle they adopt, the degree to which the health services and the wider environment support and complement their attempts to prevent disease and to improve their health as well as the access they have to quality health and personal social services in times of need. A high proportion of mortality and morbidity rates in Ireland are caused by chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. A range of measures are in place to improve health status and mortality rates. These include strategies on cancer, cardiovascular health and health promotion.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently developing a national health strategy which will be completed shortly. The new national health strategy will build on the current strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future (1994)&rdquo; and will provide a blue-print for the strategic development of the health services over the next seven to ten years. All of these strategies together with the Government's programme of investment will contribute to the improvement in life expectancy rates in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall objective of the Government's strategy in relation to drug misuse is to significantly reduce the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. With regard to treatment the objective is to provide a range of options to encourage and enable drug misusers to avail of treatment with the aim of reducing dependency and improving overall health and social well-being, with the ultimate aim of leading a drug-free lifestyle. The Merchant's Quay report broadly welcomed the new national drugs strategy and it also noted that a framework involving all relevant Departments, health and education services and the community and voluntary sector, can work to reduce the harm caused by problematic drug use. The national drugs strategy team and local drugs task forces are comprised of such a framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, which was published in May 2001 by the Taoiseach, is the result of a comprehensive review initiated by my colleague Deputy Eoin Ryan, Minister of State with responsibility for national drugs strategy in April 2000. The strategy has been developed around the four pillars of supply, prevention, treatment &ndash; including rehabilitation and risk reduction &ndash; and research. This approach incorporates, more or less, the full range of activities which are the hallmarks of modern drugs strategies in other jurisdictions. The strategy sets objectives and key performance indicators against which progress may be monitored. Some 100 individual actions have been identified which the rel<Col N="1699" /> evant bodies have to carry out in order to implement the strategy and meet its objectives. A group has been established, chaired by the deputy secretary general to drive the implementation of those actions relevant to my Department and the health boards.</P>
    <P>Services for drug users which include education, treatment and rehabilitation, continue to be expanded in all boards and significant additional funding has been made available to the boards in recent years for this purpose. The national drugs strategy team continues to work closely with the local drugs task forces to empower local communities to respond positively to the drugs issues in their own areas. Regional drugs task forces will be established in all health boards in the coming months which will also consolidate and co-ordinate existing services.</P>
    <P>There is, in every drug policy an element that requires a justice response. This is the case in Irish policy also. However, I believe that our overall policy is a balanced one which is also a strongly health focused one. A number of actions aim to broaden the range of treatment and rehabilitation options, including harm reduction measures. Health boards will continue to work with voluntary groups such as Merchants Quay to develop effective responses to the problem and through regular monitoring of the overall implementation of the strategy I am confident that the actions undertaken will have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of all the population, but particularly on those who are misusing drugs.</P>

The overall funding available each year also encompasses initiatives relating, for example, to re-equipping, refurbishment and health and safety issues across all healthcare programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A cost per cubic metre is not a normally used indicator of capital cost and my Department does not monitor expenditure on capital projects in this manner. Monitoring of capital cost, for budgetary purposes, is undertaken on a rate per square metre and on a functional unit cost basis. Both of these indicators vary greatly, depending on the type, size, functional content, complexity and duration of the particular project in question. In the light of these wide and changing variables, <Col N="1701" /> it would be difficult to calculate in a meaningful way for expenditure comparison purposes the per cubic metre cost, or the square metre cost, of different projects over time.

      <P>In 1999 my Department asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre to evaluate the problem of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland &ndash; of which antibiotic misuse is a contributing factor &ndash; and to formulate a strategy for the future. The NDSC gave detailed consideration to these issues and have drawn up a strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, which I launched on 19 June last. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance, including a strategy to control the inappropriate use of antibiotics. The SARI recommendations can be grouped into four categories: surveillance of resistance and antibiotic use; hygiene and prevention of infection; judicious use of antibiotics in hospitals and the community; and education of health care workers, patients and the general public.</P>
      <P>Tackling the problem of antimicrobial resistance is a multi-faceted issue which will require action on a number of fronts. Implementation of the strategy will take place on a phased basis over the next two to three years. As a first step, in the current year £2 million has been provided to the health boards for antimicrobial resistance measures, taking into account the recommendations in SARI and in the north-south study of MRSA in Ireland 1999.</P>
      <P>The boards have been asked to address in particular infection control strategies and staffing in both hospitals and the community, the development of surveillance systems for the collection of antimicrobial resistance data and information on antibiotic prescribing in hospitals.</P>

The Adoption Board is an independent statutory body with responsibility for the administration of the Adoption Acts 1952-1998, including the making of adoption orders and the regulation and recognition of foreign adoptions.

      <P>In line with a preceding High Court judgment, new regulations made in November 2000 do not place or authorise any restriction on the numbers of new taxi licences which may be granted by local licensing authorities. I believe that this new regime is already bringing signifi<Col N="1706" /> cant benefits to the public through the increased availability of taxis.

I anticipate that this study will provide more broadly based and up to date information on the level of taxi services in Dublin under the new regime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 249 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the Government commitment in &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;, the existing ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in Dublin and Cork was extended to Arklow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick and Wexford in 1998 and to Celbridge, Galway, Leixlip, Naas and Waterford in 2000. These areas were chosen on a precautionary basis following annual reviews of national air quality monitoring results. All areas have shown a significant improvement in terms of recorded smoke levels since the bans were introduced. The reviews preceding the ban extensions indicated relatively low smoke levels in Bray; in compari<Col N="1707" /> son, smoke levels in Arklow before the ban were twice as high as those in Bray.</P>
    <P>However, I am now of the view that it is timely to consider moving from area specific bans to extending the ban nationally given the potential for lower acidifying emissions and benefits for public health and air quality. Last week I launched a consultation paper on possible national bans on bituminous coal and petcoke. A copy is available in the Oireachtas Library. I have no proposals to extend the ban to any specific area before the completion of the consultation process.</P>

      <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, published in March 1999, set out an integrated land-use and transportation framework for the sustainable development of the area. They were commissioned by the constituent local authorities in the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities. My Department also participated in the preparatory process.</P>
      <P>In advance of new legislation to give statutory force to the guidelines, my Department requested each local authority in the greater Dublin area, in April 1999, to ensure that its development plan was aligned with the strategy set out in the strategic planning guidelines. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, the relevant provisions of which commenced on 1 January 2001, now require planning authorities to have regard to the guidelines when making and adopting a development plan.</P>
      <P>In accordance with its role as statutory consultee for development plans, my Department examined draft development plans which had been prepared during the year 2000 by Kildare, Meath and Wicklow county councils and wrote to each of those councils, between December 2000 and January 2001, raising a number of issues of concern in relation to compliance with the strategic planning guidelines. The development plans for Meath and Wicklow have since been adopted.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2001-2006 provides for a total investment of £4.7 billion &ndash; 1999 prices &ndash; in national road improvement and maintenance over the period 2000-2006, a threefold increase on the 1994-1999 period. The NDP also sets out a strategic framework for the development of the national roads network over the coming seven years. It is a matter for the NRA, within the NDP framework, to promote detailed programming of the work required and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the planned expansion of the national roads programme, my Department has approved a range of staffing proposals, both at <Col N="1709" /> NRA and local authority levels, designed to ensure adequate organisational capacity to deliver the greatly expanded national roads programme envisaged by the NDP. While, in common with many other organisations, NRA and road authorities may experience some difficulties in recruiting staff for their purposes, good progress is being maintained with the development of the national roads network as mandated in the NDP, including on the five key inter-urban routes.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority, in conjunction with local authorities, has promoted awareness abroad of the employment opportunities in the national road planning area and has succeeded in securing personnel in this way. Similar efforts will be pursued in the future, as appropriate, having regard to staffing levels in road design offices.</P>
    <P>Extensive use is being made of private consultancy firms for road planning purposes as part of the strategy to meet the NDP objectives for national roads. Design offices play a key management function in respect of firms engaged on this basis. The approach is proving effective in advancing the national roads programme through the planning process.</P>

      <P>School meals are funded by my Department using two different avenues at present. One is the school meals scheme, which has been operated in conjunction with certain local authorities for over 80 years. The other is the school meals community programme which I introduced last year. The school meals scheme provides financial assistance to local authorities, except county councils, for the provision of school meals for national school children who are &ldquo;unable by reason of lack of food to take full advantage of the education provided for them&rdquo;. In most cases, the local authorities provide participating schools with a sandwich or a bun and milk for each eligible child. My Department meets half of the food costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school meals community programme meets the food costs of the voluntary and community based groups that are currently operating innovative school meals projects outside of the scope of the statutory school meals. This funding is provided to initiatives known as breakfast or lunch clubs at local level, that are targeting areas of disadvantage or children with special needs. The type of meals provided is decided by the <Col N="1710" /> local groups that design and run the projects. The amount of funding given by my Department depends on the type and number of meals provided.</P>
    <P>The schools in the Dublin mid-west constituency that participate in the schemes are listed in the attached tabular statement. Schools that participate in the school meals scheme are listed in Table 1, while those that participate in the school meals community programme are listed in Table 2. As the Deputy may be aware, I have established an interdepartmental working group to review the school meals scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of school meals provision. I expect to receive the working group's report towards the end of this year, following which I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government regarding a reformed school meals scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received correspondence from the community development agency in question. This regional support agency is funded by my Department to work with community development projects and family resource centres in the Wicklow/Kildare/Meath area. The Family Support Agency Bill was published on 13 July 2001 and is at present before Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>The new agency will bring together the main programmes and pro-family services introduced in recent years in line with the Government's &ldquo;Families First&rdquo; approach &ndash; to support families, promote continuity and stability in family life and prevent marital breakdown and foster a supportive community environment for families at local level. Some £12 million has been allocated this year by the Government for the development of family services in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Family Support Agency will: provide a family mediation service; support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationship counselling, and other family support services; support, promote and develop the family and community services resource centre programme; provide information on these services and parenting issues; and undertake research and advise me as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs about family matters.</P>
      <P>Thus the Family Support Agency will provide a comprehensive and coherent response for families in need of these services and for families generally. The legislative initiative will involve the transfer of these schemes and programmes from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to the new agency, which reports to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. It is my view and that of the Government that the establishment of the Family Support Agency affords the opportunity to bring coherence into this complex area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> The Family Support Agency will be an important resource to the work of Family Resource Centres, enhancing the role and capacity of these local community initiatives in responding to the needs of families at neighbourhood level.</P>
    <P>The regional support agency in question is one of a number of support agencies which has been invited to meet officials of the Department to discuss these details and the matters raised in their letter to you. To date, the organisation has not been in a position to take up this invitation. However, I understand that further contact has been made with the support agency and it is hoped that they will be in a position to respond to the invitation to meet officials at an early date.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the number of recipients in receipt of the free fuel allowance; the total annual cost of the scheme; and if there are plans to increase the weekly allowance.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional £3 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to £8 per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the £3 per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.</P>
      <P>The average weekly number of recipients of the fuel allowances in the 2000-01 fuel season was 287,400. Approximately 175,000 of these received £5 per week, over 112,000 received £8 per week and less than 3,000 received £3 per week. Total expenditure on the scheme in the 2000-01 fuel season was £49.9 million.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, the increases in primary payments that I introduced in the three budgets since the scheme was reviewed have provided for a substantial real increase after fully compensating for inflation, including fuel price inflation. The increases in primary payments of £8 to £10 per week that I brought into effect in April of this year are the largest ever implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1713" /> Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, I believe it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs. Any further changes in the scheme would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others. I would also point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. These facilities are considered to be a more appropriate mechanism for meeting heating needs outside the fuel season.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> The Deputy will notice the considerable difference between the allocation and actual expenditure in this year to date. A number of factors have brought about this situation, not least the foot and mouth scare which affected progress in many of the projects, particularly those based in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Also, the projects to benefit under the ACCESS scheme have recently been selected, so it is likely that expenditure in respect of these projects will increase significantly in 2002 and in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>In the case of County Dublin, a number of major projects, such as those involving St. Stephen's Green and the Palm House at the National Botanic Gardens, have had to go through lengthy tendering and planning processes respectively, so major expenditure should come on stream in 2002 and subsequent years in the County Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Note 1 &ndash; The above figures do not incorporate the allocation and expenditure under the NDP in 2001 of the Film Board or Screen Training Ireland, both of which are funded by my Department. It was not possible to break down the figures by county in the time available. However I have instructed that the breakdown be provided and I will arrange for the material to be sent to the Deputy shortly.</P>
    <P>Note 2 &ndash; Waterways Ireland &ndash; Plant and Machinery Allocated 2001 £220,000. Spent to date 2001 £190,000. In the case of Waterways Ireland, it is not possible to allocate Plant and Machinery by county as this equipment is used on an inter county basis as the work demands. The amount spent (£190,000) is not included in the overall totals provided.</P>
    <P>Note 3* &ndash; This allocation of £5.005 million referred to in the above table was provided by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department on a national, rather then county-by-county, basis in respect of programmes such as Land Purchase, SAC Compensation, and Improvement of Visitor Facilities at Parks and Nature Reserves, and thus could not be included in the county-by-county totals. However, expenditure from this allocation has been incorporated into the county-by-county totals, with the exception of £114,000 referred to in the above table, which is in respect of the Parks and Nature Reserves Visitor Facilities programme in 2001 for which a county-by-county breakdown is not available, given the cross-county nature of the expenditure in question.</P>

      <P>Tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta gur cheannaigh an <Col N="1715" /> tÚdarás Coláiste Íosagáin i 1998. Ina dhiaidh sin, chuaigh siad chun cainte le húdaráis Choláiste na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh chun na féidearthachtaí maidir le hIonad Seachtrach Oideachais 3ú Leibhéal a chíoradh. Aontaíodh go bhfostódh an tÚdarás agus an Ollscoil comhairleoirí seachtracha chun na roghanna éagsúla a fhiosrú. Chuir na comhairleoirí sin, Deloitte &amp; Touche, tuarascáil ar fáil i 1999 agus léiríodh réimse leathan féideartheachtaí sonracha le riachtanais mhaoinithe shubstaintiúla. I rith na bliana ina dhiaidh sin (1999-2000) rinneadh teagmháil agus plé le hinstitiúidí agus eagrais éagsúla maidir le cuid de na príomhthograí a bhí luaite sa tuarascáil (m.sh. lárionad oiliúna spóirt, lárionad oiliúna/oideachais nuatheicneolaíochta) ach ní raibh aon spéis acu dul ar aghaidh lena leithéid.</P>
      <P>Faoi lár na bliana 2000 thosaigh an tÚdarás ar phlé le húdaráis Choláiste na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh arís maidir le hIonad Seachtrach Ollscoile a bhunú i gColáiste Íosagáin. D'eascair an plé seo as Plean don Ollscolaíocht trí Ghaeilge atá curtha i dtoll a chéile ag ceithre cinn d'Ollscoileanna &ndash; Corcaigh, Gaillimh, Má Nuad agus Béal Feirste. Tá an Plean sin á bhreithniú ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta faoi láthair. Tá soláthar de bhreis ar £600,000 ceadaithe ag an Údarás chun díon nua a chur ar an gColáiste. Tá conraitheoir ceaptha agus tá tús curtha leis an obair.</P>
      <P>I 1999, dhíol an tÚdarás suíomh i gcomharsanacht an Choláiste leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta mar shuíomh d'Ionad Oideachais agus tá an próiseas pleanála ina leith sin idir lámha ag an Roinn sin.          </P>

    <P>In addition, an amount of activity under this measure will have national application. This includes support for the National Framework Committee to develop family friendly initiatives at the level of the enterprise. Individual projects in the S &amp; E region have yet to be identified under this strand and under the strand for gender proofing of personnel policies.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in 2001 on the measure in the S &amp; E region is IR£409,081, 519,426. It is anticipated that expenditure in all areas of the measure will increase in the second half of 2001 as the projects commence activity.</P>
    <P>The NDP gender equality unit: under the employment and human resources development operational programme, the NDP gender equality unit has been allocated IR£4.22 million, 5.36 million, for the period 2000-06. This funding is allocated to the southern and eastern region as a whole and not to any particular county. The unit has been established to promote equal opportunities between women and men, in particular, through a gender mainstreaming approach. This unit's spending has a nationwide effect. Each county in the southern and eastern region has been represented at various training events which the unit has organised. In 2001, out of 250 people who have attended training courses, 176 have been from the S &amp; E region. Spending to the end of June 2001 by the unit was IR£91,717.00, 116,456.</P>
    <P>The crime prevention measure: funding allocated to prisons services training for the S &amp; E region for 2001 was IR£5.88 million, 7.47 million. A total of IR£1.65 million, 2.1 million, has been spent to date. All of this spending was in County Dublin. The full roll-out of the prisoner training programme throughout the region is under way.</P>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service has been <Col N="1718" /> allocated £975,635, 1,238,801, for the S&amp;E region under the NDP for 2001. A total of £141,325, 179,446, has been spent up to 30 June 2001. To date there has been no capital expenditure in this region.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure by the Probation and Welfare Service under the NDP provides for new interventions such as pre-employment training and education for offenders, referrals for substance abuse treatment and programmes for sex offenders. It is not possible to specify spending to date in each county as there are no pre-determined allocations for specific counties. It may be that offenders will avail of some of these services who are now resident outside of their county of origin, for example in hostels, or who have come before courts in other counties, or who are serving custodial sentences in prisons and places of detention not located in their home county.</P>
    <P>The Garda youth diversion programme: the expenditure allocated at county level to date under the Garda youth diversion programme is set out in the following table. A further allocation may occur in respect of these projects during 2001 subject to submission of detailed accounts.</P>

    <P>I have been informed by my Department's equal opportunities child care section that an application form for a capital grant was received from the person in question on 29 June 2001. Funding was sought towards the cost of constructing and equipping a new pre-school facility. I understand that this application was forwarded to Area Development Management Limited on 4 July 2001.

    <P>I have requested an update from ADM Limited and have been advised that the assessment is nearing completion and the application is expected to be considered by the appraisal committee in the near future.

      <P>Section 5 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986, as amended, provides that, without prejudice to the law as to contempt of court, any person having the actual custody of a child who has been given or shown a copy of a custody or access order relating to that child and who fails or refuses to give up the child to the person who has been granted custody or to allow the person entitled to access to have such access, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, open to the guardian of a child to apply to the District Court or Circuit Court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child and the court may make such order, including an access order, as it thinks proper. The court is required to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>Family law is kept under review in my Department and I will be happy to consider any specific suggestions which the Deputy has to make.</P>

    <P>*The money allocated under the Social Inclusion measure includes funding of £122m in respect of the National Drugs Strategy which will be expended by a range of Government Departments and agencies included in the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>No actual expenditure has yet been incurred from the IR£64 million (81million) allocated to the S&amp;E Regional Operational Programme under the tourism sub-measures 1 to 3 of the Local Enterprise Development Priority as the Tourism Product Investment Scheme, the vehicle for the expenditure, has had to be notified, for the first time, to the European Commission, in line with the rules on State aid. Once clearance is secured, the scheme will be launched and project proposals will be invited by Bord Fáilte Eireann, who will administer the scheme.</P>
    <P>No expenditure has been incurred to date also from the £59 million (75 million) allocated to the S&amp;E Regional Operational Programme for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities under the Culture, Recreation and Sports Measure of the Local Infrastructure Sub-Programme. Locations have yet to be identified and will be decided in the context of the National Spatial Strategy currently being undertaken by the Department of Environment and Local Government and scheduled for completion by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The amount of money spent to date in 2001, according to the latest figures supplied by the management authorities to my Department, in each of the S&amp;E counties under the National Development Plan is set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>Under the Swimming Pool Programme 2000-2002 which is administered by my Department, an application has been received in relation to the provision of a new swimming pool in Greystones and two applications were submitted by Bray Urban District Council; a refurbishment proposal from Presentation College and a second in relation to a proposed new pool in the town. To facilitate my Department's assessment of these three applications, the local authority recently indicated its priority requirement in the context of its policy as to how the swimming pool needs of the North Wicklow area can be best met in a viable and sustainable manner. This priority requirement is under consideration by the Department at present.</P>
      <P>Grants of up to £3 million are available under the swimming pool programme towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.</P>
      <P>In general there are four stages in a swimming pool project under the programme. In order of progression, these stages are: Preliminary Report; Contract Document; Tender and Construction. The Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grants are not allocated until such time as tenders for a project have been received.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) region was designated in 1999 as an Objective One region in transition. In general, programmes in the education sector are delivered on a national basis. My Department has provided provisional expenditure returns in respect of all national development plan measures, for both regions, to the respective operational programme managing authorities. The provisional expenditure return in respect of NDP measures, in the S&amp;E region, for the period January-June 2001, is £247.5 million (314.3 million).</P>
      <P>As regards the specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to allocations/ expenditure at county level under the NDP due to the wide range of programmes in the education sector, it would require an inordinate amount of official time to answer the question in the detail requested. However, if the Deputy has any queries regarding a specific measure, I will be happy to seek to obtain the information for him.  </P>

      <P>The Government has placed a high priority on increasing funding to schools. I have increased capitation and brought into being a new concept of a support services grant. In addition, schools with disadvantaged status receive further <Col N="1728" /> capitation of £30 per pupil each year. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. In my view this is, in general, a preferable approach to increasing grants for specific purposes, such as orchestra grants.</P>

      <P>On 30 July 2001, I announced the appointment of Ms Carmel Naughton as chair of the governing authority of IAPA.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office, the Government has made very substantial capital investment in the education sector. Over £200 million (254 million) was allocated for primary and post primary school capital projects in the year 2000. This was increased to over £220 million (279 million) in 2001. The equivalent figure in 1993 was £46.5 million (59 million) and in 1997, £72.3 million (93.2 million).</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to assess projects for funding having regard to priority issues such as the need for schools in rapidly developing areas, the accommodation requirements of children with special needs, the provision of accommodation to facilitate amalgamations, the need to upgrade the existing stock of schools and the stage of architectural planning a project has reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of progress to construction depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being <Col N="1730" /> dealt with by design teams and my Department's building unit, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors.</P>
    <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of projects in 2002 will be taken in the light of the foregoing and the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming estimates. The specific information on all building projects on a county by county basis and the stage each project is at is not readily available in my Department and would require an inordinate amount of official time to compile. If the Deputy has any queries regarding specific projects I will be happy to obtain the information for him.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that the <Col N="1732" /> student in question, who is an independent mature candidate, is in receipt of the non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant, from City of Dublin VEC, under the grants scheme for students pursuing post leaving certificate courses. He was assessed by the VEC for the purpose of determining eligibility for the special rate of maintenance grant, usually referred to as the top-up grant. He was, however, deemed to be ineligible. </P>
      <P>On the recommendation of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education, the special rates of maintenance grant is available to eligible mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over, but subject to specific conditions, in this case, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year, namely: he, or she, must qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants; total reckonable income, after allowances are applied, in the tax year to 5 April 2000, must not exceed £6,600; as at 1 April 2000, the applicant's spouse or partner must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments and be in receipt of full-rate Qualified Adult Allowance, or similar entitlement, in respect of the applicant, or the applicant, him/herself, must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that the student in question was in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance, which, in respect of the applicant himself, is not an eligible payment under the terms governing the special rates of grant. Similarly, a mature independent candidate who was in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance and is currently in receipt of a back to education allowance from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is not eligible for the special rate of maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>My Department understands from City of Dublin VEC that the reckonable income of the student in question exceeded the income threshold for purpose of the special rate of grant. As indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 490 of 16 October, my Department has now forwarded to the Deputy full details of the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department gives assistance to parents where children are suspended indefinitely or expelled from schools. In cases when its assistance is sought, my Department endeavours, through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate, to secure a suitable school placement.</P>
      <P>As suspension and expulsion from school are matters for each school authority, my Department has no centralised information on the numbers of pupils who may have been suspended indefinitely or expelled from primary and second level schools. Consequently the information requested by the Deputy is not available.</P>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998 provides that each school board of management must publish the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school, including the policy of the school relating to the suspension or expulsion of students.</P>
      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of expulsion only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Under the rules of national schools, no pupil can be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>The Education Act has also made provision for new appeal procedures, which provide for appeal to the Secretary General of my Department, in order to address grievances at school level, including suspension for more that 20 school days in any school year, or expulsion. These procedures will bring a greater transparency to decisions by schools in relation to long-term suspensions or expulsion and also promote fair procedures at school level. In particular, the right to appeal to a national appeals committee in relation to such decisions by schools will bring a better balance to the rights and obligations of all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education <Col N="1734" /> (Welfare) Act to address, generally, issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a countrywide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second level schools.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act provides that where a student is either suspended for a period longer than six days or misses more than a cumulative total of 15 days in a school year or displays what the school principal considers to be irregular attendance patterns, the principal shall inform the local educational welfare officer.</P>
    <P>The Act also requires schools to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any student. In such instances, the role of the educational welfare officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to try to identify a mutually agreeable solution to provide for the education of the student concerned.</P>

      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate, it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible. A psychologist from the NEPS has been involved in the case referred to by the Deputy. My Department has sanctioned seven hours per week home tuition in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to progress this case further, my Department has issued a questionnaire to the child's parents, which will help identify his edu<Col N="1735" /> cational needs and provide my Department with their written permission to contact schools on behalf of the child.</P>

      <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis, as the FÁS school-based Community Employment schemes (CE) come to an end. In the discussions that took place in connection with the transfer of funding, I agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment, CE, schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress on the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £100 &ndash; 126.98 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash;<Col N="1737" /> 50.79 &ndash; to £60 &ndash; 76.18 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or fewer will increase from £2,400 &ndash; 3,047.37 &ndash; to £4,800 &ndash; 6,094.74 &ndash; while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 &ndash; 25,394.76 &ndash; to £40,000 &ndash; 50,789.52 &ndash; per annum.</P>
    <P>My Department provides funding to the Marino Centre in respect of the special school which forms part of the centre and I am increasing the funding to all special schools over and above the increases that will apply to mainstream schools as outlined above. The rate of grant for special schools will increase from its current level of £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; per pupil per annum to £130 &ndash; 165.07 &ndash; per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 &ndash; 50.79 &ndash; to £80 &ndash; 101.58 &ndash; per pupil. This will be further increased to £105 &ndash; 133.32 &ndash; per pupil in January.</P>
    <P>My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash; 2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    <P>Schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from the special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, Co. Westmeath.</P>

      <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of projects, including Ballykilmurry National School, will be taken in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming Estimates.</P>

    <P>Architectural planning for the new three class<Col N="1740" /> room school is at an advanced stage. Because the long-term enrolments of a school are the main factor in determining the extent and type of accommodation to be provided, my Department is undertaking an assessment of the enrolments at present.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department has authorised the school to undertake essential repairs to the temporary accommodation at the school. My Department is also prepared to consider grant-aid in respect of any necessary repairs to the permanent structure.</P>
