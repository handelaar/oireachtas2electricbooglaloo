    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Those authorised in my Department to speak to the media on my behalf are the Government press secretary and the press officers in the Government Press Office. From time to time political and background briefings may be given by special advisers. Inevitably, in the absence of the Government press secretary, the same people may be drafted in as the occasion demands to brief the media on my behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government Press Office provides a comprehensive information service on Government policy to the public through the national and international media on my behalf on behalf of the Department and the Government. Through regular contact with departmental press officers, the <Col N="902" /> Government press secretary ensures there is a co-ordinated approach to media matters. The Government press secretary and his staff are in daily contact with news desks and political correspondents and are briefed on a daily basis by him and the deputy Government press secretary.</P>
    <P>Press releases, statements and speeches are faxed simultaneously to news desks daily and all important speeches and policy documents are posted on the GIS website. Staff of the Government Press Office and departmental press officers are available after hours and at weekends to answer media queries. The Government press secretary and his staff always strive to ensure the business of implementing Government policy is communicated accurately, speedily and efficiently to the media.</P>
    <P>The programme manager at my Department is the principal special adviser appointed by the Government. The role and duties of special advisers are described in section 11 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. In summary, these are providing advice; monitoring, facilitating and securing the achievement of Government objectives that relate to the Department, as requested; and performing such other functions as may be directed.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 29 of 10 March 1999, the terms of reference and the job description of my programme manager-special adviser are no different than that of his predecessors. He advises me on a wide range of matters including political, administrative, business, social, financial and economic issues.</P>
    <P>Special advisers are subject to the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and this is reflected in their contracts which contain the following paragraph in relation to duties:</P>
    <P>You will be required to perform any duties that may be assigned to you from time to time as appropriate to your position. The position will be whole-time and you may not engage in private practice or be connected with any outside business which would interfere with the performance of official duties.</P>
    <P>The nature of their duties requires officials and advisers from time to time to have contact with Members of the Oireachtas. I am confident my advisers apply the highest professional standards in those contacts as with all business conducted on my behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach direct his programme manager to brief the press on 16 February to the effect that the Taoiseach intended to deal with the matter if the then Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, did not resign when in fact Deputy O'Keeffe had already tendered his resignation earlier that day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, my programme manager did not give any briefing that day. The Government press secretary gave a briefing in accord<Col N="903" /> ance with my instructions to the effect that I was dealing with this matter. Deputy Quinn is incorrect in saying that Deputy O'Keeffe resigned earlier that day; he had informed me of his intention to consult his family and resign in the afternoon of the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the media coverage in the various newspapers &ndash; I am referring to one newspaper in particular but the coverage is much the same across the board &ndash; clearly conveyed the impression that the Taoiseach intended to exert pressure on the then Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to resign if he did not volunteer to do so at a time when the Taoiseach was already aware that was Deputy O'Keeffe's intention? Does the Taoiseach agree he allowed his spokesperson to mislead the public through the media?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree I did that on the day in question or on any other day. Unfortunately, I do not write newspaper headlines. I do not believe anyone was misrepresented. Members of the media covered this issue for a number of days prior to 16 February and they all correctly reported that I would deal with this issue which I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach's programme manager speak directly to the then Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, advising him to resign? How does the Taoiseach explain the discrepancies between his and Deputy O'Keeffe's version of events?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My programme manager did not speak to Deputy O'Keeffe at that stage although he did speak to him a week previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>To what end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme manager spoke to Deputy O'Keeffe by telephone regarding questions which arose about letters which the programme manager had heard were written by the then Minister of State in relation to the Environmental Protection Agency. He discussed these letters and other matters with Deputy O'Keeffe at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the discussion between the programme manager and the then Minister of State occur in the context of Deputy O'Keeffe's future as a Minister of State or was it simply in the context of allegations which were being made in regard to practices in the Deputy's family business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has ruled that allegations or charges can only be made by way of substantive motion. These are questions of a general nature and we cannot go into&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any allegations. I was simply going to say suggestions were made <Col N="904" /> that practices on Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's farm were not up to best practice. Was the context of the conversation between the Taoiseach's programme manager and the then Minister, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, possible resignation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was some time previous to that. My programme manager, on my instructions, was checking information about letters which had been written by the Deputy to the Environmental Protection Agency regarding a neighbour.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied there is a written record of that conversation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is. I had asked my programme manager to make the call because I was at another event. He took a note of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it available or will I look for it under the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave the note to me. I remind the House that in the case of Ministers of State, the House does not have any role in their appointment, resignation or removal. The matter is exclusively a function of the Government in the case of appointments and removals, and in the case of resignation, it is a matter for the Taoiseach. That has been and still is the practice in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Would the Taoiseach agree that anonymous media briefings by the Taoiseach or his Government under cover of &ldquo;Government sources&rdquo; or &ldquo;reliable Government sources&rdquo; is a dishonest way of communicating with the public? Would he agree that this means can by cynically used by the Government or Ministers to test the air, to fly kites, to see how some Government proposal might be received, but allowing the Government to back away without accepting responsibility? Would he also agree that this practice should be stopped and that when the press is briefed on the instructions of the Taoiseach or the Government, it should be done openly on behalf of the Taoiseach or the Government, by a named servant of the Government, and put out for public discussion in an open and honest way, rather than by way of the underhand manipulation, so-called spinning, that is the practice of so many governments in western Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very wide ranging question. There was no spinning involved in the matter we are talking about. The person who gave the briefing acted on my behalf. The media reported what he said, that I was dealing with the matter. It was carried on the front pages of all the newspapers the following day. People flying kites or spinning are not always welcome, because the Government does not always know who is at it or from what side of the House it comes. I agree with the Deputy on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone who is the subject matter of this question is quoted as saying that the Taoiseach intended to deal with an issue when in fact, by virtue of the Taoiseach's own statement to the House today and earlier, the issue had been dealt with. The net point is that the Minister of State was going to resign, the matter had been resolved, he was just waiting for time to inform his family. If it was not the programme manager who briefed the media, it was someone who as a civil servant was asked to spin on behalf of the Taoiseach in a particular way designed to be misleading. Does the Taoiseach accept that he gave instructions to that person to mislead the media in the way in which&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Charges of misleading should not be made against the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to establish whether an instruction was given. Does the Taoiseach not agree that a deliberately misleading spin was put out on his behalf?  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask a question, not make an allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a deliberately misleading spin was issued on his behalf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that there was no spin attached to these statements. The Government press secretary asked what he was to say in his daily briefing to the media and he said precisely what I asked him to say. It is an oversimplification to say that the matter had been dealt with because it had not. It was not the final contact. There was to be further contact. It would have been much better if there had been nothing about it, but that is not possible in the normal workings of life. However, what I said did not have a spin put on it and was reported. I have no argument with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the interest generated by Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, which, in the main, appear to centre on the resignation of the former Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, will the Taoiseach give a full account to the Dáil of the exact circumstances surrounding the resignation&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions do not relate to a specific case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent: Mr. Sargent:">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or are these questions as good as it will get in explaining matters to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question lies in the rules of procedure and precedence in the House. What I said on 20 February went much further than what should have been the case. To reiterate, the rule states that on no occasion or precedent is the Taoiseach of the day required to divulge details to the House of dis<Col N="906" /> cussions and other dialogue which always accompany the appointment, resignation or removal of Ministers in circumstances where the House has a constitutional role in approving the nomination of a Taoiseach or Ministers of a Government. That has been the practice since the 1930s. The House does not have a role in the appointment, resignation or removal of Ministers of State. These are matters exclusively for the Government in the case of appointments or removals and the Taoiseach in the case of resignations. Similar considerations apply to similar matters which are proper to Government. As always, I try to be helpful and have probably said enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach if he could reconcile the difference in opinion between his programme manager and Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. I wish to return to that question because the Taoiseach did not answer it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has advised on many occasions that the matter can be dealt with by way of substantive motion. That is the only way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a serious doubt about the precise functions of programme managers when a particular programme manager refuses to confirm or deny that he asked for a Minister of State's resignation and when, on the previous day, the said Minister of State indicated that the programme manager had not only looked for his head, but his whole body. This is damaging to democracy. Will the Taoiseach reconcile these differences? There is a straight contradiction between the former Minister of State and his programme manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Taoiseach asked the former Minister of State to resign earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it did not relate to that matter. They did not have a conversation during that period. The Deputy asked what issue they discussed at that stage. I have answered that question and have no more to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconcile the difference between the former Minister of State and his programme manager?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Minister of State said that he was asked to resign and the Taoiseach's <Col N="907" /> programme manager will neither confirm nor deny that he asked him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 187 freedom of information requests were received in my Department during 2000. A further 65 applications were received in January and February 2001, making a total of 252 applications received in the 14 months ended 28 February 2001. A decision was taken to grant the request in 100 cases and to part grant it in 46. Of the remaining 106 cases, 18 were refused, no records were held in respect of 46, 18 were transferred, 12 were withdrawn and 12 are ongoing.</P>
      <P>I do not have an exact average of the time taken to process and adjudicate on applications. However, in most cases the statutory 28 days are required to process a request. The number of requests made by journalists in 2000 was 99 or 53% of total applications. Requests received by my Department are processed in accordance with the Act, the implementation of which in my Department is reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>This question relates to the Freedom of Information Act and to what matters should be held as coming under the Act so that it is fully complied with. I do not recall the details concerning the destruction of diaries last April. If the Deputy wishes, I will consult on what action has been taken. The personal diaries of civil servants are not available under the Act. The departmental diaries&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking whether I issued a directive that departmental diaries or records be maintained. The answer to that is yes in relation to the Freedom of Information Act, which is complied with. Last April it was said that departmental diaries should be maintained. I can confirm that for Deputy Noonan if he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the concerns expressed on a number of occasions by the Information Commissioner regarding the serious backlog in processing requests under the Freedom of Information Act, not only because of the increase in applications but also because of the chronic shortage of staff? Is the Taoiseach aware that within the Information Commissioner's office there is now a two-year delay in processing and dealing with appeals due to staff shortages? What measures are to be put in place to ensure that this matter is rectified? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only answer for my own Department, but this does not seem to be the case. The Department of the Taoiseach has only two cases where the standard 28-day period has elapsed. This delay has occurred where the officials dealing with the matters have had to consider the implications for third parties of the release of material in accordance with the requirements of the Act. If the difficulty which Deputy Naughten refers to arises elsewhere, it does not do so in the operation of the Act in my Department.</P>

      <P>In relation to the information commission, does the Taoiseach believe the ongoing delays of up to two years in dealing with appeals are acceptable? The commission deals with all Government Departments, including the Department of the Taoiseach, if an appeal is made. What measures will be put in place to ensure appeals are dealt with swiftly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be as much haste as possible in dealing with appeals. I am not aware that delays are arising. That is not the information I have in relation to my Department where only two cases went outside the 28 days limit and there are no appeals. The number of staff in the information commission office was substantially increased last year. I would be disappointed if that increase was not ensuring that cases are addressed. The problem does not arise in my Department but, to be helpful to the Deputy, I will have the position checked to ascertain whether there is a difficulty. The staffing problem last year was dealt with through the recruitment of additional staff and I hope that is having a considerable effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem persists. Does the Taoiseach agree that such delays negate the <Col N="910" /> reasons people apply for information in the first place and contradict the principle of the Freedom of Information Act? Will he ensure the issue is resolved?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been drawn to anecdotal evidence that hand-written records are not being kept in various Departments because of the threat that this information may be sought under the Freedom of Information Act? As a result, some people cannot access information that could be valuable to them in terms of appeals they may lodge or other matters.</P>

      <P>E-mails to the Department are replied to as quickly as possible and in accordance with the quality customer service standards for my Department as set out in our customer action plan. As part of these standards, my Department aims to provide a substantive response to 70% of correspondence within 15 working days of receipt and in the case of the Government press service, within seven working days. Where it is not possible to issue a full reply within 15 working days, it is my Department's policy to advise the correspondent as to when it will be possible to issue such a response. In practice, however, most e-mail queries received by the webmaster in my Department are responded to on the same day.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the article in <i>Magill</i>. I read the article on this matter in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on 27 February. In that case the biographical details sought were on the website but there was an oversight in replying to the e-mail. It was believed the facts were already on the website but the e-mail should have been replied to. There are now approximately 24,000 or 25,000 e-mails sent per year, almost 6,000 per quarter. The website is being redesigned to tighten up the procedures, many of which existed when only a few hundred were sent each year. Electronic mail is now widely used and the policy is to answer as many queries as possible within 15 days, which is not always possible. The website is being redesigned to make the system more workable for the staff concerned.</P>

      <P>The Information Society Commission set down the ground rules in this regard, which are being followed. All the Departments are working with their e-strategies and action programmes to deliver this. The quality customer service lays down the procedures for answering e-mails, including targets that should be set for answering them. All arms of Government are reaching out in this respect. There is a long list of developments across the public service covering the e-Government and e-Cabinet projects, on which I answered questions previously. These were cleared last April and we are working on them. All those developments are having an effect. I am not saying the system is perfect, but officials are working to make the e-public service broker system more efficient. It will require a fair amount of resources and effort to make it perfect, and that will take some years to achieve.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to carry out an audit on the progress to date not only in his Department but in other Departments and in the public service generally on the level of training available to public servants and Ministers on how to carry out business on the Internet and through e-mail? Is he satisfied that more than a year can elapse between the delivery of equipment and the provision of training to secretarial assistants, which indicates that considerable time is wasted and resources are not being properly used to provide training in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties is that a large number of the people, when they reach a high standard in the public service, are recruited by outside bodies at very substantial salaries. We have lost many of the good people who were trained in the use of the system. Training provision, the training models in place and the out<Col N="919" /> side companies engaged in that work have improved greatly.</P>
      <P>I have a long list of what the information society has done, which is set out in its booklets and is on its website. It is an impressive list and it is also related to the customer action plans in the Departments and State agencies for dealing with these matters.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right that technology in this area is constantly improving. Since the guidelines on technology were published in 1998, the equipment and the ability to use it has improved considerably. While it is not easy to keep abreast of those improvements by way of staff training, an enormous effort is being made by the Information Society Commission, in terms of its advice and its various groups involved in training inside and outside my Department and on the new website, on which an outside group is advising, as that speeds up matters. Many private sector companies are engaged in this kind of work and the system is working relatively well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to improvements, but I asked two specific questions. Does he propose to carry out an audit to measure the extent of the improvements he mentioned, and is it satisfactory &ndash; even if it an improvement &ndash; that more than a year may elapse between a civil servant taking delivery of equipment and being trained in its use? Does he declare that to be an improvement? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In my Department, some of the new equipment is in place and staff have already undergone training through an outside company. Therefore, I am not too sure what the Deputy is talking about. Perhaps he would give me that information.</P>
      <P>On the audit standards, I already answered that and I apologise for not repeating myself. The quality customer service standards involve an on-going assessment and examination of the procedures to make sure the staff are not only trained and are using the systems but that they also monitor their effectiveness. That is part of the procedure.</P>
      <P>I am not saying all these procedures are prefect because there is an enormous amount of change and there are also staff changes. Earlier I gave the figures for my Department. It is an enormous change from the position even two or three years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>A section within the Taoiseach's Department, the CSO, could take a leaf out of the Revenue Commissioners' book. What plans are in place within the CSO to improve access to information on the website? Will he ensure returns can be made to the CSO in a manner similar to that used by the Revenue Commissioners? Although he may not be aware of this, the Tánaiste would be aware that the huge amount of red tape involved in making returns <Col N="920" /> to the CSO is putting immense pressure on small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I will look at that. The Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are way ahead of other Departments in their capacity to deal with their customers in this way. I am not aware of what is necessary to put in place those standards in the CSO but, as Deputies will be aware from having dealt with those offices, the quality and standard of the service and the speed with which both the Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs deal with these issues is commendable. I will ask the Minister of State to raise the matter with the CSO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply and with particular reference to the substantial increase in the number of queries arriving in his Department and others in the form of electronic mail in recent months, has he looked at the manner in which this matter is being addressed in the European Parliament? There has been an explosive increase in the amount of contact between citizens of the EU and the European Parliament and other European institutions. Has he examined the manner in which the European Parliament and the European Commission has addressed this real problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not looked at that but we are well served by an excellent Information Society Commission, which, even though its membership is changing, involves some of the top people across the industries who are not only aware of these schemes but are involved in designing most of them. This does not have to do with a lack of knowledge but with our ability to have websites which include all of the modern customer action plans and standards.</P>
      <P>The Deputy correctly stated that the number of electronic mail queries is increasing. The number of electronic mails received by my Department would have been very small three years ago but it is approaching 25,000 this year. The way the public is doing business has changed totally. A recent survey showed that half of the households in an area of this city have access to technology. There is obvious growth in this area. It is the way people of all ages, but particularly young people, are communicating. That survey showed that three quarters of our young people use electronic means to convey their messages.</P>
      <P>This does change the system greatly. It shows the success of the Information Society Commission, which has been putting forward the ways in which we should operate business in this country. Such change involves a cost on the State and necessitates training, but these changes are taking place and they are proving to be very effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach impress on his colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment and <Col N="921" /> Local Government, the need to ensure improvements in this regard in local authorities and health boards because the number of people attempting to make inquiries and representations and seeking information <i>via</i> electronic mail is increasing significantly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring that matter to its attention. The interdepartmental committee has developed a strategy for e-procurement across the public service, including central government, local authorities and the health service. It has also developed recruitment services for the Civil Service Commission and Local Appointments Commission. It has, at least, dealt with some of these areas. I will bring the Deputy's views to the attention of the Ministers concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the report of the Information Society Commission, the targets set by the Government in relation to e-government and the £30 million spent to date, does the Taoiseach agree that his Department should be leading by example and not dragging the CSO behind the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and that e-mails should be responded to more quickly? The Taoiseach signed the electronic signatures agreement with the United States. Does he believe that it is unacceptable that someone can download his signature from the website? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only have I signed that agreement, I have signed many other documents since in the same way. I remind the Deputy that the first phase of the Revenue on-line service was introduced last summer, that further phases are due to be introduced this year and that the Electronic Commerce Bill with which the Tánaiste was involved has been enacted. In most of these areas this country has been classified and recognised as being way ahead of other countries, although the CSO and others still have a lot of work to do. The challenge is to bring everyone up to the same level. It will take much more than £30 million to do this. Where equipment or training is required, the Minister for Finance has given priority to such schemes and programmes. He has not allowed the availability of resources to hold back the advancement of any of the Government proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>According to estimates made by Bord Bia, exports of agri-food products amounted to approximately £5.4 billion last year. Although figures for the full year are not yet available, it is expected that total exports of merchandise goods last year will have exceeded £60 billion. Exports in the period January to October 2000, the latest period for which figures are available, reached £59.3 billion, an increase of 25% on the same period in the previous year. The CSO initial estimate of exports in December is an additional £6.26 billion.</P>
      <P>An outbreak of foot and mouth disease would affect primarily the agri-food industry and have knock-on effects in other sectors of the economy. It is estimated that each job in the agri-food industry supports up to four others. The food industry employs about 47,000 people in addition to the number of farmers. The best way to protect those jobs and all businesses which might be affected by an outbreak is to prevent this dreadful disease from entering Ireland. As the Deputy is aware, the Government is taking every possible step to do that. The implications of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the agri-food industry are a matter primarily for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

How many lay-offs have there been in the past ten days as a result of the foot and mouth scare?

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has established an expert committee of biologists and microbiologists to advise on the appropriateness of control measures in place and on the level of risk posed by certain events or activities, particularly in the context of the tourism industry and what changes might be made in that regard. All decisions are made on the basis of clear expert advice.</P>

      <Quest>the anticipated consumer and employment implications of the foot and mouth situation for our consumers and economy; the measures she has taken to address this; if she is satisfied that consumers have adequate access to information and advice regarding foot and mouth disease; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear what anticipated consumer implications the Deputy has in mind. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has put in place a number of helplines to answer queries from individual members of the public in addition to press and television advertisements. Information is also available on the Department's website. The advice from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is that there are no serious human health implications and that humans do not become infected by eating meat from infected animals. I understand retailers have been notified through the Food Safety Authority of Ireland of any products that need to be removed from their shelves. Members of the public who have concerns about particular products should contact one of the Department's helplines or the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
      <P>If foot and mouth disease were to enter Ireland, the most serious implications for employment would be in the farming and agri-food sectors. It is difficult to predict what impact there would be for other sectors of the economy. It has been estimated that for every job in industry there are four jobs elsewhere in the economy and, therefore, the wider implications could be greater than the direct impact. The development agencies are in close contact with clients to ensure key companies have contingency plans. It is crucial that we all remain vigilant in following the procedures that have been put in place to ensure this disease does not enter the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is united in trying to ensure the disease does not enter the country but the Minister of State seems to be trapped in the paradigm that only agriculture is affected. The question seeks to establish the employment implications. The Minister of State must know that hundreds of conferences, for example, have been abandoned and serious grief is being caused to various elements of the tourism industry. Is he unaware of the impact outside the agriculture industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. There is no doubt we are very much aware of the impact on other sectors. Many sectors of the tourism industry, in <Col N="925" /> particular, are suffering. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has met various tourism interests and is conscious of their concerns. No decision has been made regarding compensation. That issue has emerged and the Government's position is that it is imperative we proceed with strong, stringent measures to keep the disease out. There are many jobs in the food industry. A total of 47,000 people are employed in the industry and the implications for employment are greater in the beef, pigmeat, lamb and dairy sectors. There are clear needs in the food sector but that is also the case across a wide range of other areas. The Government's position is to be steadfast in its efforts to keep out the disease. We are not out of the woods yet and that is our approach. However, we are conscious that some sectors are suffering.</P>

      <P>Other than being committed to keeping the disease out, with which we all agree, am I correct in taking it that the Minister of State does not have an assessment available to him of the employment implications of the current restrictions, not if the disease should enter the country? Other than facilitating the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, about which we are all pleased, what other restrictions are being finessed by the Government? If the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis can be facilitated, why can conferences, for example, which are generally being abandoned, not take place? Why are the restrictions not being refined?</P>

      <P>Continuous assessments are being undertaken by the Government committee which is meeting on a daily basis. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who is co-ordinating this approach, has sought the expert advice of scientists in this area to make sure decisions are made on the basis of sound advice in regard to any relaxation of the restrictions in place. That is the way forward to assist the sectors about which the Deputy and I are concerned. The Deputy referred to those organising conferences and that is an area of concern. Decisions on the relaxation of the current position will be based on sound advice. The companies involved will suffer even more if the disease is not kept out. That is our approach, which we are determined to undertake, but we will analyse the situation on a daily basis. Our concern is that vulnerable sectors will get an opportunity to resume business as the regime in place is relaxed.</P>

      <P>I am alert to recent reports concerning the treatment of some immigrant workers by a number of unscrupulous Irish employers and employment agencies and in this regard my Department is taking a number of specific initiatives.</P>
      <P>The administrative procedures for the issue of work permits have been examined and improved so as to better protect the employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned. From later this month the application will have to be signed by the prospective employees, as confirmation that they are familiar with and accept the terms of the job on offer.</P>
      <P>It is also intended that within weeks applications for work permits will be accompanied by an explanatory document setting out the essential elements of Irish employment rights legislation and protections for workers. This material will be presented in various languages. Possibilities for administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries are also being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of foreign workers in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, is also under way to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to modern practices in the employment agency business and the labour inspectorate business plan for the current year has as a key task a specific and targeted enforcement campaign in employments hiring foreign workers as well as sectors where such workers are employed. In <Col N="927" /> addition, the labour inspectorate is currently engaged in a systematic investigation of recent reports alleging abuses affecting foreign nursing and hotel and catering sector staff and implicated employers and employment agencies are being pursued with a view to prosecutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware of the systematic exploitation of eastern European workers, particularly in the agri-business sector and the outdoor pursuits area? Many workers have come here in good faith and at considerable cost to themselves with regard to travel and insurance. They are promised jobs to which they are indentured as a result of the personal nature of the work permit and many of them work overtime without pay and have to work for weeks with no days off. They do not have a choice because of the personal nature of their green cards and the matter is so urgent that it requires a rapid fire response. The Tánaiste mentioned a strategy in her response but a strategy is only as good as its enforcement. How many field officers make up the inspectorate she mentioned? On average, how many calls does that inspectorate make in one week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are lucky in some respects.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the problem raised by Deputy Flanagan and am concerned that some individuals working here are not being paid for overtime and weekend work or are being expected to work weekends without remuneration. In other cases excessive fees are being deducted for accommodation. That is why a fairly aggressive campaign is under way from the labour inspectorate. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, works more closely in this area but I understand we have 20 inspectors working in this sector. Recently they have been in contact with 100 employment agencies in the State as well as research agencies in this area. A number of prosecutions are pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will know that our employment rights legislation does not discriminate between <Col N="928" /> Irish nationals and others working in this jurisdiction but on occasion foreign workers, because of the language barrier, are not necessarily aware of their employment rights. That is why we are changing the administrative regime for issuing work permits. Heretofore the application had to be solely made by the prospective employer but we want to ensure the prospective employee is fully aware of his or her rights and we will also ensure that this employment law is issued to each prospective employee in his or her native language. We are beginning with six languages &ndash; Russian, Latvian, Czech, Lithuanian, Polish and Chinese &ndash; and we hope in time to move on to other languages but most of our applicants come from these areas.</P>
    <P>Four main areas are being targeted at present: crèches, the agriculture sector and in particular the mushroom and meat plants, as well as the hotel and catering industries. Priority is being given to target areas where a large number of work permits have been issued and where there have been complaints against particular employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste's reply indicates that action is being taken and there is at least a plan of action for the future. One of the difficulties here is that the work permit document is a personal document and that revocation of it will mean the person is no longer an employee. Part of the problem facing these employees is that work permit registration is being used as a vehicle to ensure an oppressive regime can operate. There is a need to free up the personal nature of the work permit or to ensure that a changeover from one employer to another can take place within a time frame that does not give rise to the delays we are seeing at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan makes a good deal of sense because clearly a vulnerable person who comes here with a work permit may be under the impression that if he or she makes a complaint he or she will have no alternative but to leave the jurisdiction or that he or she might not find alternative employment. We need to update the 1971 Act, as there are huge difficulties with it, but that is under way. Virtually all these people come to Ireland through employment agencies of one kind or other so we must change the licensing and registration of such agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also work with the regulatory authorities of these workers' countries of origin. Recently we had a number of visits from the labour attaché of the Philippines Embassy in London in relation to complaints from citizens of that country who had come to work in Ireland, particularly those working in nursing homes. Clearly we <Col N="929" /> must tighten the legislation on the authorisation and registration of employment agencies while also working with other authorities. We should perhaps look at the arrangements under the working visa arrangement; approximately 2,000 people are here with a working visa which does not tie them to the employer with whom they initially take up employment. We must consider doing something of that nature for areas in the economy where there clearly are shortages.</P>

      <P>On the visit, I led a trade mission on which 64 companies were represented, one of the largest trade missions ever to travel from Ireland. The IT and telecommunications sector was the single largest sector represented, with the engineering services, education, food ingredients and clothing sectors also well represented.</P>
      <P>My schedule during the visit included the following: performing the official opening of a seminar on mobile Internet solutions, which brought together 15 of the companies in the trade delegation with 120 of the key players in the corresponding Japanese sector; opening the new trade and technology centre established by Enterprise Ireland in Tokyo, which will allow Irish companies to establish themselves in Japan without having to bear the additional and relatively heavy burden of setting up an independent office in Tokyo from the outset &ndash; Enterprise Ireland expects to have at least eight companies installed in this new facility by the end of the year; holding a number of meetings at the request of the IDA, including one at which Sumicem Opto-Electronics (Ireland) Ltd. announced an increase in its Limerick investment to establish a new research and development facility there; an address to a lunch organised by Bord Fáilte for the board of the Japan Association of Travel Agents. In recent years Bord Fáilte has worked hard to increase the number of tourists coming to Ireland from Japan. The figure currently stands at 30,000 per annum and it is hoped to increase that to 100,000 per annum over the next four years.</P>

      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for the companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to either. The same prohibition by the EU will apply to the new regulatory body which has just been sanctioned by Government.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons for the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; IFSRA &ndash; is to provide better protection to the consumer across the range of financial services. IFSRA will ensure that prudential regulation of financial services operates to a high standard but with a strong consumer focus. It will provide a one stop shop for the consumer of financial services. It will have a dedicated statutory officer responsible for customer protection who will also have a role in promoting the financial education of the public. It will also have a statutory ombudsman scheme and a special consumer panel.</P>

      <P>Insurance premiums have increased by an average of 28% in the past 12 months. Does the Minister agree there is a need to open the Irish insurance market to the full effects of EU integration? That there are only the big five insurance companies in this country means there is a cartel. The 160,000 small companies in the State pay average insurance costs of £7,000. That is, on average, considerably more than what an individual company would spend on training, research and development, design or packaging. The situation is getting out of hand. The regulator is now in position. Will the Minister consider backdating his remit to deal with the fact that the insurance companies have imposed excessive increases because they were fearful of the impact of the regulator?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to an increase of 28% over the past year. There have been various increases in insurance since 1996 and the maximum total increase would be 35.8% over that period, not 28% in the past year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons given by the industry for these increases include increased claims costs <Col N="933" /> and worsening claims experience to the point where insurers are making underwriting losses and there is increasing difficulty in reinsuring business. It might also be due to the contraction in the number of insurers active in certain sections of the market together with increasing property which allows prices to drift upwards. We have an advanced economy. Wages are higher, new vehicles are being purchased and property is more valuable. These factors have led to increased costs.</P>
      <P>The Government is taking initiatives to deal with the situation. It will proceed with the personal injuries assessment board. It is awaiting the outcome of the motor insurance advisory board report and will respond to its recommendations as quickly as possible. It would not be possible to have retrospection pertaining to the new authority. A new structure must be put in position. It will be given a wide remit, strong powers and a very high-powered staff. We are confident that when it comes into operation, with the new initiatives that Government will take pertaining to insurance, it will have an effect on the cost of insurance over a medium period.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the only element of competition appears to be the level of brokers' commission? Why will the Minister not allow competition from Europe into Ireland and why is there a cartel of five companies with complete control of business insurance? Why should small companies pay in excess of £7,000 per annum for insurance because there is no competition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in the insurance market globally is that there is a major contraction due to acquisitions and amalgamation of companies. Companies are getting bigger and the number of companies is dropping. Last week I met international insurers to try to persuade them to operate in Ireland. The third European Union directive that implements the single market for insurance explicitly forbids member states from intervening in the matter of pricing of insurance. By implication, Governments cannot influence pricing through attempting to influence underwriting. Ireland as an exporter of insurance services has an interest in upholding this prohibition within European law. We must be very careful. There is nothing to stop any insurance company that operates within the EU from delivering cover to any member state under the directive and the delivery of services. We want competition within the companies operating here and we are working on that through the motor insurance advisory board and various other current initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not be concerned that companies must spend more on insurance than on research and development? That is the case at the moment as shown in a survey of 160,000 small companies within the State. <Col N="934" /> These are growing small companies and the cost factor for insurance is considerably higher than in the UK or western Europe. Why is that?</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I received the report of the Donegal task force initiative on 1 July 1999. After considering the recommendations I presented it to Government on 14 July. On my recommendation, it was agreed that all Government Departments should examine the report and consider the investment priorities in the context of drafting the operational programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-06. The Donegal County Development Board has now undertaken the task of monitoring the implementation of the task force recommendations. Various sectoral groups, established by the board and covering such areas as inward investment, indigenous enterprise development and infrastructure are working towards a December 2001 deadline for completion of their contributions to a strategic plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is not possible to quantify in total the financial implications for the Exchequer at this stage, I can outline what has happened to date. Twenty-five retraining courses with an average duration of 28 weeks were provided by FÁS for Fruit of the Loom staff at a cost of £4.2 million. Donegal County Council established a £5 million economic development fund, of which £3 million has already been spent on land acquisition, incubation units, marketing and other initiatives. The telecommunications infrastructure is also being developed and the Department of Public Enterprise has announced 13 projects nationwide, <Col N="935" /> which will receive a total of £59 million. Three of these projects involve the development of infrastructure in County Donegal. Aer Arann has been approved maximum Exchequer subvention of £3.9 million to operate a Donegal to Dublin air route from February last. The Department of Marine and Natural Resources is working on a £35 million development for Killybegs fishery harbour centre, which will take two and a half years to complete. Expenditure of over £1million was undertaken at other fishery harbours last year. An ambitious roads programme for the county has also been included in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The industrial development agencies, including the county enterprise boards, are committed to playing their part in the development of Donegal by maintaining the maximum number of existing jobs and attracting new investment. The task force report looked primarily at economic matters but also aspects are now being examined which will include an updated plan for the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for the many positive assertions in her reply. Could the Tánaiste confirm that the high level of funding currently enjoyed in Donegal for technology, sanitary and water services roads and rail will continue? Will she agree, notwithstanding the positive aspects, that access was a key issue in the task force report and that the IDA is actually using the lack of an N2 upgrade as a reason why job creation is not happening? This is a huge issue for the county, not just for job creation but for ease of access and for tourism. Can the Tánaiste outline the Exchequer's report that may be forthcoming to advance the development of this road to meet the standards set on the Dublin to Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Belfast routes?</P>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that Enterprise Ireland had the potential to assist Donegal in respect of buildings and marketing and in respect of relocating indigenous industries out of Dublin and into the county's smaller towns not currently the focus of the IDA? The Donegal task force report focused on job creation numbers. Can the Tánaiste confirm that job creation remains an issue that will gain full Exchequer support as necessary in the light of the many job losses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Access was identified as an issue that acts as a barrier not just to job development but also to tourism and other aspects of the development of Donegal. It is not just a question of air access but also road access. Money has been allocated to Aer Aran and also the Government was involved with the authorities in Northern Ireland concerning the improvement of facilities at Derry airport. That was an unusual initiative for the Irish Government, given that Derry airport is outside our jurisdiction but many of the benefits resulting from Derry airport go to Donegal. Donegal is in the Objective 1 region and therefore 50% of all new greenfield jobs that <Col N="936" /> IDA Ireland is charged with bringing to Ireland must be to that region. Donegal features highly in the United States and we hope one of the projects discussed the week before last will find Donegal an attractive location.</P>

      <P>Could the Tánaiste undertake to raise with her Cabinet colleagues the issue of the N2-A5 road again because of the discrimination against Donegal in respect of road access that it presents, running contrary to the concept of job creation and regional development? Could she also outline a little more about the strategic plan and what will happen in December 2001 given that the task force report was in 1999?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform Deputy Rabbitte that there were 25 courses offered to the former workers with an average duration of 28 weeks. All the courses offered, which were held throughout the county at a cost of £4.2 million, were City and Guilds certified. The courses covered information technology, care of the elderly, community care, tele-services, child care training, return to work, career development, heavy goods vehicles, computerised accounts and payroll, hairdressing etc. This exercise is currently being replicated for the employees of the Fruit of the Loom factory in Buncrana who were made redundant most recently. On the follow-through, I understand many of the former employees are in new employment but I do not have specific details. I will forward details to the Deputy if I obtain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road network is not my responsibility but it is being addressed under the national development plan roads strategy. Although the N2 will not be of the same standard as the roads to other cities, it will be a vast improvement on the existing road network to Donegal. The Deputy made a valid point that the issue of road access to Donegal should be revisited as speed to market <Col N="937" /> and the international airport in the capital is important for the county's development.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the comments made by the former chief executive of the IDA but a number of new companies have located in County Donegal recently, of which Specific Care is one. The significant difference between the current IDA strategy for Donegal and that which pertained in the past is that a variety of companies from different sectors are locating there. In the past, there was an over-concentration on certain sectors in areas such as Donegal and the midlands and when those sectors got into difficulty, huge downturns resulted. The current strategy, albeit time-consuming, is working and I am confident there will be more good news for Donegal in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation to provide for the appointment of an ombudsman for the newspaper industry. In recommending the establishment of an ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards, the Commission on the Newspaper Industry was clear that the ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry itself and I agree with that recommendation.</P>
      <P>I understand that, while some preparatory work has been carried out by the newspaper industry, the recommendation on the establishment of an ombudsman has not yet been implemented. The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation and, in that respect, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to provide any estimate of the costs of establishing and operating the proposed office of ombudsman as that is a matter for the newspaper industry itself. I have no reason to doubt the newspaper industry's commitment to implementing the ombudsman recommendation, albeit linked to reform of the law on defamation, and, accordingly, I have no proposals in relation to its failure to do so.</P>

      <P>Is the Government, the newspaper industry or both dragging their feet on this issue? Is this a set-up between the Government and the newspaper industry? Why have we not seen action on the commission's 1996 recommendation? Guidelines were to be furnished within two months of the publication of the commission's report but no such guidelines were published. The Minister referred to the need for legislative change in this area and that is a matter for the Government. Are the Government and the newspaper industry in league with each other to ensure nothing happens?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, the appointment of an ombudsman is a question for the newspaper industry. There is no question of an ombudsman being established on a statutory basis to be funded by taxpayers. The newspaper industry has always linked the appointment of an ombudsman with changes in the defamation legislation which is a matter for my Government colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand work is progressing on changing the law in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in stating that in regard to changes in the law on defamation, all that is required is to provide immunity for complaints to a press ombudsman? Is it not the case that the newspaper industry is pressing for further changes in the law on defamation which it is effectively using as a lever with the Government? Nothing is happening on this issue. It is like waiting for Godot. The only reasonable conclusion one can draw is that this Government is in thrall to powerful interests in the newspaper industry and that, as far as it is concerned, it is payback time and a press ombudsman will not be established under its regime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe may not realise how humorous is his comment on people being in thrall to powerful forces in the newspaper industry. On the appointment of an ombudsman or a press council, many options can be explored where people have legitimate grievances which they cannot have addressed other than through the courts. Citizens who might normally be reluctant to take action through the courts do not have any alternative in this area. It is important that an ombudsman or press council be established but there is no question of an ombudsman being appointed on a statutory basis; the commission's report did not contain any such suggestion. The newspaper industry itself must appoint and finance an ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Changing the law on defamation is a separate matter, although it was linked by the industry to the appointment of an ombudsman. It was suggested that if the newspaper industry were to appoint an ombudsman, such a person would be given privileges in regard to immunity which would clearly be a matter requiring legislation. Other Ministers such as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is responsible for bringing forward proposals on defamation, may be more familiar with this issue than I am. Perhaps representatives of the newspaper industry have discussed the matter of immunity with him but it has not been discussed with me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying the Minister is extremely relaxed about the central issue of Deputy O'Keeffe's question? Why is she opposed to an ombudsman being appointed on a statutory basis? Given the lapses we have witnessed in recent years, does she not consider it to be in the interests of good journalists and good journalism that an ombudsman be appointed? Why would legislating for such an appointment automatically confer a cost on taxpayers? Does the Minister agree it is unlikely her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will bring forward proposals to reform defamation law in the lifetime of this Government? Even if he does so, newspaper proprietors may take the view they are inadequate and an ombudsman will not even be appointed at that stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's question concerned the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which were presented to my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton. Deputy Rabbitte's point on whether we should provide for statutory protection, be it an ombudsman, press council etc., in this area is valid. We must consider providing citizens who are damaged by the media with an alternative to recourse to the courts and we must ensure members of the media are made aware of their responsibilities. I am not certain when the legislation on defamation will be produced or what form it will take. There has been extensive lobbying from the newspaper industry in the past about the need for this legislation. Any changes in the law relating to defamation could only take place if accompanied by the establishment of an ombudsman, either statutory or industry based. It would have to have credibility and powers of enforcement. If we were to provide for a statutory ombudsman or press council and legislate for that and force that on the industry, that would have to be paid for by the industry.</P>

There may well be a need for change but that would have to be accompanied by procedures such as the establishment of either a press council or an ombudsman in order to be fair to the ordinary citizen. Litigation is expensive and it can place additional burdens on ordinary people. If there were not to be an ombudsman or a press council or some form of redress, many Members of the House would be reluctant to change the defamation laws. I would favour a change in the laws if it could be accompanied by something like an ombudsman or a press council.</P>
      <P>We need to have a correct balance. The media has huge powers to inform, to educate, to entertain, but it also has powers to mis-inform and perhaps to abuse people. Therefore, any change would have to be accompanied by protection.</P>

      <P>The Minister says she favours the establishment of an ombudsman or a press complaints commission, but why does she not do something about it? Does she not appreciate that the only image she presents here is of someone wringing her hands and doing a Pontius Pilate job.</P>
      <P>The Calcott Commission was set up in the United Kingdom in 1990. It established a period of 18 months during which a new self-regulatory authority was to be set up and in default of that, recommended that a statutory authority would be set up. I am not saying the United Kingdom has the perfect answer but at least it had the guts to make the change from the old discredited press commission. Will the Minister tell us what she will do to achieve the establishment of a press ombudsman?</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the Sinnott case. The Minister for Education and Science gave assurances to the House on the last occasion that the appeal he filed to the Supreme Court ruling was merely for the purpose of establishing the law and the State's constitutional obligations regarding the education of adults. He said that all payments awarded in the High Court would be paid to the Sinnott family. The State's solicitor had the same understanding as me of the Minister's statement because he wrote to the Sinnott's solicitors and said that the Minister intends to discharge the award of damages made by Mr. Justice Barr in his judgment in the High Court. It appears, however, that, for the Supreme Court hearing, counsel for the State has been briefed on the basis of not paying the £55,000 awarded to Mrs. Sinnott.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was away last week and may not be aware that the Minister for Education and Science effectively misled the House when he said: &ldquo;This is a technical appeal &ldquo;. The advice we have received, as outlined by Deputy Noonan, is that the case is being appealed in its entirety. Why is the Government taking this action? I suspect it is bowing to legal advice. Given the position the Taoiseach and the Government are in, have we learned nothing from previous legal pursuits on the basis of legal advice against the clear desire to give this family and the citizen concerned justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court appeal is due to commence on Tuesday next, 27 March. The Government believes that the court is the best and most appropriate forum for consideration and determination of the issues involved. A detailed discussion of the appeal and the merits of its grounds would not be appropriate, but I will attempt to set out the position.</P>
      <P>The appeal focuses on the High Court's decision that a person is entitled as a constitutional right to be provided with free primary education for as long as he or she can benefit from it, even if that means primary education for life. As it stands, this appears to imply that any adult at any time must be given access to free primary education in a primary school setting. The appeal also seeks to clarify issues related to the separation of powers. The award of damages to a person in respect of a breach of a constitutional duty to another breaks new constitutional ground and the court is being invited to consider the nature and scope of this right. This is a new aspect and the purpose of the appeal is to consider its nature and scope for the future.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the appeal, the Government has agreed to pay all damages awarded to Jamie Sinnott, which amount to £222,500, on an <i>ex gratia </i>basis. It has also agreed to pay the £15,000 for past expenses incurred by Mrs. Sinnott in her son's education and all High and Supreme Court legal costs for both sides. The payment of these damages and costs is not affected by the appeal and a refund will not be sought in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the outcome of the appeal, the Government is committed to providing for the primary education of all children, especially those who are autistic, severely or profoundly handicapped or who have other special education needs. The Government is also committed to providing services, including developmental and training services, for all severely or profoundly handicapped adults in an adult appropriate context and setting.

    <P>These are the facts as I understand them. The point raised by Deputies Noonan and Quinn relates to the case made last week. In the matters advanced last week, the court was also asked for <Col N="949" /> its views on the issue of the payment of £40,000 in damages to Mrs. Sinnott.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a sum of £15,000 has been paid, the balance is £40,000. This issue was linked to the case made regarding the breaking of new constitutional ground. The court has been invited to consider the nature and scope of the right involved. This aspect is before the court and I understand it was not covered in the other costs mentioned. The Government, in conjunction with its legal advisers, hopes to receive full clarification of this matter. However, the other damages of £222,500 and £15,000 for past expenses will be paid, although I accept that the figure of £40,000 appeared to be separated from that amount. The appeal relates to the reasons outlined regarding the nature and scope of the new constitutional ground, but all the High and Supreme Court legal costs for both sides will be met. I cannot give any more details. The other aspects will have to be advanced in the Supreme Court next Tuesday.</P>

      <P>Apart from being more succinct, the Taoiseach has not advanced the matter any further than the Minister for Education and Science two weeks ago. Two issues still arise. First, the House was misled by the Minister for Education and Science when he said that all awards due to Jamie or Kathryn Sinnott would be paid. It now transpires that the Government is challenging £40,000 of the £55,000 award made to Mrs. Sinnott. Second, the Taoiseach justified the appeal to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the Government wants to establish the constitutional obligation of the State regarding the ongoing education of special children into adulthood. Yet, he also said that it is a matter of Government policy to provide whatever education is necessary.</P>

It has been the Government's intention to find ways and means to pay these large costs, but this must be considered in the context of how the issue will be dealt with in the Supreme Court.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will continue to do everything it can to resolve this dispute. I do not need to go over the entire history of it because I did so previously on many occasions both inside and outside the House. Since I last spoke on the issue on the Order of Business, the Government regrets that the Labour Court decision has been speedily turned down. Mr. Pomphrett, as facilitator, brokered the arrangement to go to the Labour Court and asked that the outcome be put to the membership at large which, unfortunately, has not been the case. Even though the ASTI membership did not sign up to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government took the advice of the arbitrator when he asked that the PPF increases be paid in good faith. The Government agreed to pay the increases, even though it was not bound to do so, and I acknowledge the Labour Court looked <Col N="952" /> upon this in a favourable light. It stated that the PPF increases, plus previous special awards, should be taken as payments on account, effectively saying the case put forward by the ASTI has been dealt with in that regard.</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday morning, following careful examination of the Labour Court's report, the Government accepted that the teachers have a sustainable case. The Government understands the English language in relation to industrial relations terms. Following due process and through the various mechanisms, the Government accepts that teachers have a case for some financial rewards. The issue in this dispute is not money, it is that the entire public and private sector workforce has, under the terms of the PPF, agreed certain mechanisms. They did so during the latest negotiations on 4 December when all sides agreed on the issue. The Government cannot move away from that but it is anxious to resolve the outstanding issues for ASTI and others in relation to the benchmarking process. On 4 December it was agreed that the benchmarking process would pay arrears of anything conceded, which inevitably will be the case. The first substantial part will be paid from next December. If the Government can be more helpful in trying to explain, outline or analyse any of these issues, it will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I believe the ASTI leadership is aware of the position. It would like the Government to abandon the PPF but it will not do so. It would like us to abandon the benchmarking system.</P>

      <P>The Government will not follow these mechanisms. I know I am not allowed to answer Deputy Higgins on this matter, but the Deputy has got it wrong. The Government has paid up. ASTI members have received the same tax breaks as everyone else. Unfortunately, one group is out of line. If they come back into line, the matter can be resolved. The Government is anxious to assist in this matter because it does not want to affect the teachers in their everyday work or children in their preparation for State examinations. However, it cannot throw away the industrial relations mechanism, whether the conciliation and arbitration aspect, the Labour Court aspect, the Labour Relations Commission or the benchmarking aspect. Unfortunately, ASTI &ndash; I say this with no ranker &ndash; is asking the Government to ignore everything, which it cannot and will not do.</P>

They do not want the Government to abandon everything. They want a resolution to this matter and time is rapidly running out. An entire generation of students will have their educational careers blighted if action is not taken quickly and effectively. The only person who can do this is the Taoiseach.

Every one of them said the same thing and the Minister followed their recommendations. He has done no more and no less; he has correctly followed what was stated.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment in the name of Deputies Jim Mitchell and Paul McGrath seeks to empower a Minister for Finance to announce increases in personal tax credits, but then withhold from taxpayers up to 75% of the benefit of those increases. The amounts withheld are to be lodged in a new fund to be called the National Investment Fund administered by the NTMA. Each taxpayer is to be given share certificates which he or she can redeem in five years at their then value and tax free. The objective of this scheme, I understand, is to reduce inflationary pressures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was concluded on the basis of a net increase in take home pay of 25% over the duration of the programme. The increase is to be delivered via a combination of pay and tax reductions. Subsequently the pay aspects of the PPF have been adjusted. It is difficult to see how this proposed scheme could be <Col N="961" /> implemented without giving rise to a reduction in take home pay, which taxpayers expect to receive as a result of the budget. Such a reduction would be likely to open up matters already settled in the context of the PPF and the recently agreed adjustment.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not think that the vast majority of taxpayers would be impressed by this scheme. Furthermore the amendment is so short on detail that I doubt it could be implemented, even if I thought it was a good idea &ndash; which I do not.</P>
    <P>In my budget speech last December, I pointed out that in the last three years I have removed 176,000 low earners from the tax net, cut the burden on the lower paid by half, reduced the tax rate on the low paid in many cases by 10 percentage points or more and done far more than in many other advanced economies in cutting taxes on single and married earners on low and middle incomes.</P>
    <P>If, instead of letting the benefits of our growing economy be shared by all taxpayers, I had issued them with share certificates, telling them that they could have jam tomorrow or even in five years' time, I do not think they would have been overly impressed. I believe in letting people make their own choices as to what they do with their money.</P>
    <P>This proposed national investment fund would effectively amount to compulsory savings. I know there are some countries which have introduced compulsory savings schemes for their citizens, for example Singapore. However, I do not believe such schemes are suitable for this country. Irish people like to have a choice as to how they save their money and the Government is supplying and encouraging that choice through the new voluntary savings scheme and through the major reforms in recent years in the taxation regime for pensions. I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is as good a time as any to point out a significant difference of opinion between my party, the Minister and the Fine Gael Party. The general thrust of this amendment, and the Minister's saving scheme outlined later in the Bill, is to give people money and to encourage them in the case of the Minister and to oblige them in the case of the Fine Gael amendment to set aside money for a number of years. I fundamentally disagree with that. In recent years we have done a great deal to increase consumers' capacity to buy things &ndash; as the Minister puts it, to use their own money. The priority of this State and Government now has to shift very significantly towards making the investment in services which is now the priority, the opportunity and the challenge of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem sensible to generate demand and then look to take it out again, to give people money and encourage them set it aside or to give people money, as suggested in the Fine Gael amendment, and to effectively oblige them to set <Col N="962" /> it aside. What we should do with the riches of this economy is invest in services so that in five years time we do not just have extra money in our own piggy banks but we have an improved economy, improved infrastructure and, most importantly, improved public services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with some of what Deputy McDowell said about improved services but the reality is that a very substantial allocation has been made for capital services. We are now running into real difficulties not only planning and compulsory purchase order difficulties but difficulties in not having enough construction companies to undertake the tasks. The result is that we are ending up with increased inflation instead of increased output. It has been suggested to me that prices for some projects may have gone up by as much as 60% because of the law of supply and demand &ndash; the supply of contractors to do the work. If anything, this would be a terrible misuse of public funds. We have to address the question of how we meet the undoubted infrastructural deficit. We have put down other amendments to help to address that problem.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, spending is increasing at a very high rate and is adding to inflation. In due course, this will greatly affect our competitiveness. We need only look at the foot and mouth disease crisis in the UK and here and at what is happening in Japan at the moment and the overall impact that can have on the world economy in a very short time. We should see that spending today while forgetting about tomorrow is something that should go out of fashion quickly. We should take steps urgently to greatly increase private saving. We should do more about public savings as well, although the 1% set aside has been in place for the past few years and is something I fully support. I think I suggested it initially when I was chairman of the finance committee. I would like to see it increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's objective in this Bill is to do something to encourage private savings. My criticism of his proposal is twofold. First, there is an unquantifiable cost to the Exchequer and, second, there is an unquantifiable increase in savings. One cannot quantify the increase in savings as distinct from switching from present savings mechanisms. I said on Second and Committee Stages that I will switch the bit of savings I have for my children's education into this scheme. Why would I not? I will advise all my friends to do likewise because it is a gift from the Government. However, that does not mean I will increase my savings &ndash; I cannot afford to do so. I am quite sure there are hundreds of thousands of people in my position. The end result will be that the Government will be paying out to people who are already saving. Some people may say that is great because we have loads of money and there are huge surpluses but will we have huge surpluses in two to six years' time to which we are committing <Col N="963" /> ourselves under the savings provisions of this Bill? </P>
    <P>As against that, this amendment proposes a form of savings which has a number of benefits. First, the cost is quantifiable as the Government will decide each year the amount of tax credits given in this way. It should depend on the level of the surplus available in that year. The cost is, therefore, quantifiable. Second, the increase in savings is quantifiable, so one can clearly reach one's objective at a cost that one knows. Those are the two weaknesses of the Minister's scheme. There is, however, a third weakness. The Minister's commitments on savings and tax cuts place a commitment on the Exchequer for every year to come. What is given in this year of a big surplus will be a charge against the Exchequer next year and in the following years. It is a recurring cost regardless of how the economy does in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>That is the real test of the wisdom of the Government's economic policies. Is it doing things now that are wise and will safeguard our prosperity for the future? Much of what the Minister has done has been very good and innovative but in his savings scheme and tax cuts, he has not acted wisely. To that extent only, the criticisms of the European Union about the Government's policies being excessively inflationary and expansionary are valid. However, they are not valid in two other respects. First, the Minister is right, and I fully support him, in wishing to share the wealth created with the people who have helped to create it. Second, anyone who looks at the percentage of GNP spent on public services in this country knows that it is low by international standards and that spending on public services is not too high in real terms but only in terms of not having sufficient capacity to deliver the product we want at a price that is reasonable.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the Minister is given the power to establish a national investment fund. That fund would be established by statute and would be run by the National Treasury Management Agency along the lines of a private pension scheme. It would receive share certificates annually from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of each taxpayer depending on the decision of the Government each year as to the amount of the tax credit. It would invest that in a basket of shares and funds so as to minimise risk and maximise profit potential. There is a provision that these shares could not be cashed for five years. There are two precedents for that. In the Minister's savings scheme, he proposes that people must keep their money in the bank for five years. The business expansion scheme also requires that investment be kept for five years. The five years has a parallel in this Bill and a precedent in the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>More than that, it is provided that people get a profit share each year depending on how the economy does. I am committed to the concept of profit sharing. It introduces an incentive for all <Col N="964" /> members of society to continue to contribute to the economic growth on the basis that they will get a share. This works in many companies. I worked in Guinness, which was very farseeing in this respect. The company has operated a profit sharing scheme for its employees which depends on annual profits for many years. Guinness does not commit itself for the next five or six years on the basis of the current year's profits. People are also given a stake in society and are able to avail of share ownership.</P>
    <P>This is different from the Eircom flotation in that these shares would be provided as a return on people's taxes and would not be charged at an excessive price. The incentive for the taxpayer to retain shares for five years is that at the end of the term if there is added value, which is likely but not certain, and there are dividends, which are likely but not certain, they will be paid tax free. That is the payback. This is a way of sharing wealth without adding to inflationary and expansionary pressures.</P>
    <P>We did not devise this proposal on the back of an envelope. I have pressed for this for more than two years. I have discussed the proposal in detail with the Revenue Commissioners, the National Treasury Management Agency and other experts both at home and abroad and they believe this is the way to provide income tax concessions at this time. It is the way to share wealth without adding to expansionary pressures. If the Minister adopted the proposals he would not have a case to answer to the EU.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell is not in favour of the NTMA managing the national investment fund of Fine Gael or the savings fund and says there should not be tax cuts as there are services which still need resources. This relates to the old tax and spend ethos from which I thought we had got away. If the small percentage of people who think that way were to be divided between Sinn Féin, the Workers Party, the Green Party and the Labour Party, there would be few votes for each party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>The Deputy will find a number of people on the Government benches who agree with that thinking, and the Minister knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree all services need to be improved. However, the improvements must be planned and resources provided. For example, the Government has increased spending on health services from £3 billion to almost £5 billion. Services are being improved in a planned manner. Deputy Mitchell stated one of the reasons he tabled the amendment was to address the infrastructure deficit but he also suggested that the money would be invested in shares, stocks and bonds. There is a conflict about whether the money will be invested in shares, stocks and bonds or to address the infrastructure deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is whether one uses a carrot or stick in regard to the savings of citizens. The <Col N="965" /> scheme proposed by the Minister whereby people will be enticed to make savings is better than forcing them to save, which some would not want. There is a better choice for consumers in the scheme set out in the legislation. They can decide to invest in a scheme which shares profits or in a scheme run by an insurance company, building society or bank which invests money in funds related to the stock market. Deputy Mitchell also stated it would be an opportunity for him to deflect money which he currently invests in his children's education fund into the Minister's scheme because the scheme is most attractive. Everyone intends to invest money in the proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>People who have funds available will deflect money from other savings schemes. However, those aged between 21 and 30, in particular, have a great deal of money which they spend on consumer goods and socialising at weekends. They would not have been inclined to save previously but because of the attraction of the Minister's scheme they will invest money in it. However, they would not like to be forced to save money in a scheme similar to the national investment fund proposed by the Government. All Members will agree there is too much Government interference in regard to citizens' rights. The more a citizen can do with the money he or she earns the better and that is generally accepted, although not by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I am against the NTMA having huge resources and developing large funds. As Deputy Mitchell said, more people should have shares and they should have greater control over their personal finances. It is better to provide people with an opportunity to invest through the saving scheme in funds or shares because they will use their own judgment and make their own decisions rather than having it forced on them by the State. I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ardagh confused two issues. There is no question of investing such a fund in infrastructure. It would be up to the trustees of the fund to decide what to invest in and there would also be a reasonable mix of risk. They would not be confined, for instance, to investing in the State. The fund must have the same freedom as a normal pension fund.</P>
      <P>Many people, particularly young people, who received direct tax cuts have sought housing, the effect of which was to increase the cost of housing, and they are greatly exposed. If there is a downturn in the market in a few years' time there is a danger they will have negative equity and no savings. Under my proposed scheme, inflationary pressures will be cooled and people will be provided with a nest egg for the future. There is a compelling case in the current circumstances for a scheme along these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were necessary to draft a Bill to give effect to this proposal, other dimensions could be considered. For instance, if people wanted to sell in compelling circumstances before the five year <Col N="966" /> term was up, could provision be made for the State to buy back the shares at a discount, depending on which year the house was sold? Such issues could be teased out and discussed. The amendment provides that where a person or spouse dies the shares would be fully redeemed to the person if he or she wanted to redeem them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider whether people would want to make additional voluntary contributions to the scheme so as to increase their savings in a way that would be subject to the same tax free concessions at the end. There is a great deal with which to commend the amendment and though I do not expect the Minister to incorporate it into the Bill he said on Committee Stage, as did Deputy McDowell, that it was an innovative idea. I hope something along these lines is adopted by the next Finance Bill and we can set a headline for other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was debated at length on Committee Stage and also during the debate on the Bill's provisions concerning the savings incentive scheme, which was also debated adequately on Committee Stage. I am not saying, forever and a day, that the savings scheme that I have thought up is the greatest thing on the planet, as some commentators said, but it is an innovative way of encouraging people to enter the savings market.</P>
      <P>We have acted in the current and capital expenditure areas. During my time in office we have increased the amounts being spent on current services significantly &ndash; everything from social welfare to education and health. We have had a large capital programme. The national development plan sets out clearly what we intend to do through to 2006. In the same period our budget surplus will have the effect of running down the national debt, not alone in percentage terms, but in nominal terms also. At the same time I am putting money aside for the pensions reserve fund. As Deputy Mitchell rightly said and as I have indicated on numerous occasions in the recent past, our expenditure as a percentage of GDP is one of the lowest in the European Union. The purpose of the savings incentive scheme is to encourage people to save.</P>
      <P>There is a view, as Deputy McDowell is right to indicate, that taxation reductions and expenditure increases are mutually exclusive, but it is one to which I do not subscribe, as is well known. If one has the right environment &ndash; taxation can play a significant role in ensuring this &ndash; one can gather the wherewithal to do many things in the area of expenditure of which one might otherwise only dream. We have debated this matter many times and I will not do so again. As Deputy Ardagh said, it is a matter of choice. I am giving the people a choice in these taxation changes and in the area of incentivised savings. At a future date I will consider the ideas advanced by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate what I have often said: economics is not an exact science. Deputy Mitchell and every<Col N="967" /> one else would agree that personal savings are a very good thing for the individual. Deputy Mitchell mentioned Japan to which we should refer to prove the point that economics is not an exact science. The problem with Japan is that while people save, the Government wants them to spend. All efforts there in recent years have been geared at encouraging people to spend, but the Government has failed in that regard. I make that point to emphasise that economics is not an exact science and that one cannot just press a button for a formula that will work everywhere.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 to 11, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 18, column (3), line 11, to delete &ldquo;£1,628&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£2,104&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments seek increase tax credit. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 seek increase the married person's tax credit to 3,600 with an equivalent IR£ amount for the reduced tax year in 2001. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 seek to increase the single person's tax credit to 1,800 while amendments Nos. 8 and 9 seek to increase the incapacitated child's tax credit to 800, again with the IR£ equivalent reduced to 74% for the year 2001.</P>
      <P>These are my primary tax amendments on Report Stage. My party has always been of the view since tax credits were introduced that they are far and away the best means of reducing tax or potentially increasing tax in future years. They give the same benefit to all taxpayers, irrespective of what the marginal rate of tax is. It is a significant benefit over and above the system of tax free allowances we used to have. That case is now generally accepted and it is one significant reform which the Minister has instituted which I unequivocally welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a number of points on Committee Stage that he has begun to repeat today. He said that he does not believe that expenditure increases and tax reductions are mutually exclusive. Clearly, based on the Estimates for this year and last December's budget, he does not believe that now, but he has believed it for most of the last three or four years. When he first came to power he said that he did not see an increase in current spending over and above 4%. He went so far as to say that if inflation was higher than this figure, it would involve or entail real reductions in current expenditure. Clearly, the Minister has either changed his mind very dramatically or he misled us in the early stages of his regime. I suspect that he has changed his mind on the matter, or rather that he is accommodating himself to something which seems to make a certain amount of electoral sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> It is important to acknowledge, as I do, if we are to have an intelligent debate on this matter, that this year's budget and Estimates are different. I acknowledge that the measure of the increase in expenditure and investment in services is about right. That was not the case in previous years when the Minister, albeit with a little smoothing of the figures, sought to keep within the targets he had set for himself. We need to sustain the level of investment that the Minister has instituted in this year's budget, assuming we maintain good budgetary numbers, in the next three to four years.</P>
    <P>If one has a current budget surplus and a general Exchequer surplus, there are a number of things that can be done. One can reduce the national debt, reduce tax or increase expenditure. One can, as the Government has decided to do, broadly speaking with our support, set aside money for future liabilities through the 1% of GNP payment. One can do as the Minister has done and encourage personal savings: one can give money to people and seek to encourage them to tie it up for a few years. These measures are not all mutually exclusive and the fact that they are all happening is proof of this. They are not mutually exclusive, however, because our current economic circumstances are spectacularly good. Our current budget surplus is in the region of 9,000 million, which is totally unprecedented in our economic history and which we are unlikely to experience for many years to come. We can do everything and the Minister, with half an eye on the forthcoming general election, is doing just that. From a purely electoral point of view, if one was to discount the political and economic considerations, perhaps he is doing what he sees as right.</P>
    <P>That will not remain the case into the future. We will have to make choices. I am not saying that these are absolute &ldquo;either-or&rdquo; choices, but they are choices which oblige us to set priorities. We must state what we consider to be the priority of Government for the next four or five years. That priority is investment. This is not to the exclusion of reducing the national debt, something we must do. Neither is it to the absolute exclusion of delivering on some tax cuts, something we must do also. It is no more or no less than a statement of political priority; it is a matter of saying that one believes that in four or five years all of us as a society need to be better off, not just have a few extra pounds in our piggy bank.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to paint it as a clear choice between the rights and interests of &ldquo;society&rdquo; and those of individuals because the two are inextricably linked. Is it in our interests, as a society, that we have a decent public transport system? Of course, it is. It is also in each individual's interest that he or she should be able to get to work or school or to go shopping in town without the hassle and oppression from which one currently suffers. Is it in our individual and collective interests that we have a better and more equal <Col N="969" /> health service? It is. To attempt to draw an artificial distinction between individual interests and the interests of society generally does not serve the argument well.</P>
    <P>In his earlier comments Deputy Mitchell appeared to suggest, with some justification, that there are difficulties in spending now. There are constraints. They exist in the construction industry and there are labour constraints in some service sectors. There are many areas, however, where there are no constraints. An additional few dozen buses have been put on Dublin's streets in recent years, for example, but many more could have been provided. Hardly anything has been done to increase the rolling stock available to Iarnród Éireann, either for the DART or mainline rail services. The plans have been in place for at least two or three years, but they are only now being implemented. As these items are purchased abroad, I cannot see how their purchase could have any impact on inflation and the constraints in our economy are, simply, irrelevant in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is no reason that we should have to ask teachers and students to raise funds for the daily maintenance of schools. I cannot see any constraints that should restrict the Government from increasing capitation grants and grants for maintenance, caretakers and so forth to a level which would allow schools to get on with the business of teaching, assuming we leave the current difficulties aside. A great deal can be done almost immediately in terms of the investment of public moneys without being affected by the constraints which are apparent in, for example, particular parts of the labour market.</P>
    <P>We have debated my amendments at great length and I can anticipate most of the Minister's response. There was a brief discussion on Committee Stage on the tax credit relating to the incapacitated child and I understood the Minister might discuss that element of the tax credit on this Stage. I would be obliged if he would do so.</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage that I have a real difficulty with the amendments tabled by Deputies Mitchell and McGrath which focus on the PAYE allowance. This allowance is being doubled by the Minister from £1,000 to £2,000 and converted back to a tax credit. The Fine Gael amendment seeks to quadruple it. I understand the grá the trade union movement has for the PAYE allowance. I also understand the difficulties it gives rise to. I have no difficulty with the increase from £1,000 to £2,000; we can live with it, provided it is sustainable. We should not forget, however, the debate on individualisation which took place about 15 months ago. If we choose to use the PAYE allowance to remove people from the tax net, we will take a considerable additional step on the road to individualisation. It is, effectively, individualising the personal allowances, something with which I profoundly disagree.</P>
    <P>We should seek to remove those on the minimum wage from the income tax net, but we should try to do so by increasing the personal tax <Col N="970" /> credit while retaining full transferability between spouses. We should not opt to do so only on an individual basis because the PAYE allowance, or the employee tax credit as it is now called, is not transferable between spouses. It is a cheap means of doing something that is politically popular, but we should resist that temptation. We should do it properly, in a way that maintains transferability between spouses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to discuss amendments Nos. 10 and 11 in my name and that of Deputy McGrath. We propose that the PAYE allowance be increased to £3,500 and then converted to a tax credit. This is part of a package of proposals which signifies a different approach by Fine Gael to the issue of tax concessions.</P>
      <P>We do not believe that the Government's individualisation policies are fair or equitable between spouses who go out to work and spouses who stay at home and work. Neither do we believe that they are fair as between those who work part time and those who work full time. In addition, we do not believe that it is fair to spouses who have to give up work or lose their jobs. The problems with individualisation will come home to roost if there is a decline in the economy and jobs are lost. When people lose their salaries, they lose their tax allowance. A desperate injustice will be done, therefore, by the Minister's individualisation policy.</P>
      <P>It does not have an impact now because employment continues to grow. However, there will be situations where a spouse might lose or wish to give up their job because they need to look after a sick child or just wish to look after their children or a new baby. In that situation they will lose both their salary and their individual tax allowance. We have rehearsed all the arguments about two couples living next door to each other, both of whom have the same gross income. In one case one spouse works and in the other the two spouses work, but the take home pay is greater in the household where the two spouses work. That is unfair and will lead to the problems I have mentioned if and when one of the spouses loses or leaves a job.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there is a cost attached to going out to work. In our proposals we seek to make realistic provision for this. There would also be the benefit, which Deputy McDowell spotted, that our proposal would remove a great number of the low-paid, especially those on the minimum wage or less, from the tax net. When a Minister I tried to persuade the then Department of Social Welfare that there was a major problem with how it calculated replacement ratios; in other words, the gross amount one would need to earn in employment to be better off than if one were on social welfare and other secondary benefits. I was supported by the Department of Finance at the time, but rejected by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department would take gross pay, less income tax and PRSI, and compare it with social <Col N="971" /> welfare payments and claim that there was still a big gap. However, it did not take into account what I call &ldquo;off wage packet provisions&rdquo; such as medical cards, reduced local authority rents and the cost of going out to work. There are many tangible costs. Eventually, I wrote an article for <i>The Irish Times</i>. It covered a full page and, to my surprise, the newspaper published it. It included a table showing all the factors which I believed should be taken into account. It isolated the elements which were not taken account of, but which were causing huge incentive problems.</P>
    <P>At the time, despite high unemployment, many people with children were leaving work to go on the dole. They were worse off at work. The child tax allowance had been abolished whereas there was, and still is, an allowance per child in the social welfare system. No allowance was made for the fact that somebody going out to work had to buy extra clothes and had trade union, eating out and transport costs. Now the big cost is child care.</P>
    <P>The proposal in amendments Nos. 10 and 11 is to increase the PAYE allowance from £1,000 to £3,500. The Minister proposes to double it, but we seek to go further. Our proposal is part of a package that also includes changes to individualisation which we propose elsewhere. Until there is a transparent and reasonable provision in the tax code to allow the costs associated with going out to work the tax system will never be completely fair. There is provision for the costs of the self-employed and others, but nothing for those in the PAYE system. Because PAYE workers pay tax on a current, up-to-date, basis there is a case for making an extra concession to them. That is the reason we make the proposals in amendments Nos. 10 and 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the tax credits applicable in the coming tax year which are set out in the Schedule to which amendments have been tabled by Deputies McDowell, Mitchell and me. They give us an opportunity to deal with the question of individualisation. We need to look at what has happened in relation to individualisation, the effects of which, with the gap opened by the Minister, are frightening.</P>
      <P>We take as an example two couples in adjoining households the income of which is £40,000 gross. In one household both spouses are working while there is only one earner in the other. Is it not ironic that the household with only one earner will pay in the region of £44 a week more in tax for the privilege of having just one income? Not only is that unreasonable, it is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider the numbers who availed of the home carer's allowance which got the Minister out of a hole last year and redressed the balance a little. It managed to take the heat from the backbenchers off the Minister. There was, however, a very poor take-up of the allowance. In the region of 115,000 had availed of it up to November last year. Tax experts expected a far <Col N="972" /> greater take-up. They expected the number to be at least double that amount. One of the difficulties was that one had to apply for the allowance. As many do not bother filing tax returns, many did not avail of it. I know of several people who came to see me at my clinic who did not look for the allowance because they did not know it was available. They do not read up on such matters. Unless tax officials were asked to include the allowance, it was not included. The whole question of individualisation needs to be put right.</P>
    <P>The Minister tied the home carer's allowance to those with dependants at home. Many women in their fifties and above had to give up their jobs on marriage. Many of those who are still home carers will not receive the allowance as they do have dependent children under the age of 18 years. That is unfair and cuts out those with children in higher education for whom they are caring to a greater extent in the sense that they bring home their washing and need supplies for the week that they are away.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the effect of taxation. I have taken another look at the report on our taxation system completed by Mr. King of NCB stockbrokers which makes compelling reading. It indicates that in the last ten years the system has not delivered on what it set out to deliver. The question of tax credits is misleading. If we were to ask the man in the street whether his tax situation had improved in the last ten years, he would, probably, say that tax rates were lower, personal allowances seemed bigger and he seemed to be better off. The reality is that in the last ten years matters have not changed. The survey conducted by Mr. King indicates that the amount paid in tax by the top 10% of taxpayers increased by 0.4%, from 29.6% to 30% over the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>It covers the ten year period from 1990 to 1999. It includes the figures for actual out-turns and is based on completed year reports from employers as well as national income and expenditure figures. It is also based on the annual statistical reports of the Revenue Commissioners from 1990 to last November. It contains up-to-date accurate information and has not been challenged anywhere by the Government. For the next 30% of taxpayers the percentage fell from 21.8% to 20.5%, a change of 0.7%. There was, therefore, only a marginal change in the amount paid by them in tax. This is surprising. For the remaining 60% of taxpayers the percentage fell from 11.2% to 10.2%. In other words, there was a 1% change in the bottom rate. That is frightening. It is not all that long ago when someone on a salary of £20,000 would have been in receipt of a personal married couple allowance of about £7,000. They were then taxed on the balance after mortgage and other allowances were subtracted. What happens now? Personal allowances are being converted to tax credits. Allow<Col N="973" /> ances of up to £11,000 for a couple appear very big, but when translated to a tax credit are quite small.</P>
      <P>Another problem discussed on Committee Stage was that presented by the new tax form. It is causing bedlam. I received a video and CD-ROM explaining it, but have not yet had an opportunity to play them. Only a small percentage of tax forms have been issued, but amazing numbers are causing difficulties. Intelligent individuals are finding it difficult to understand the new tax form. As people are encountering difficulties, perhaps the Minister will persuade the media moguls to run programmes on the issue. Maybe he will also invite Mr. King along to interpret his report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to express my personal views on the concept of individualisation. I listened earlier to the contributions made by my colleagues on this side of the House and do not have any difficulty with anything they said. Tax laws should not interfere with the society of which we are very proud. I am inclined to ignore what happens in other countries; we should not follow suit for the sake of it.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, we have had thousands of stay-at-home spouses in this country &ndash; primarily women &ndash; who have contributed enormously to society in terms of child care, voluntary work, care of the elderly etc. They make contributions which, irrespective of what allowances are made in a Finance Bill, can never be rewarded.</P>
      <P>I do not have any problem with two spouses going out to work, if they wish to do so. They are entitled to a fair crack of the whip through the tax laws. Equally, those who stay at home and make voluntary contributions to society, which are never taken into account in terms of their monetary value to the State's coffers, are entitled to recognition. If we imply that those who stay at home do not have any great value in monetary terms to society or the State, fewer and fewer people will continue to provide the services that they currently provide and will, instead, take the view that the State should do so. What will happen then? What will it cost the State if increasing numbers have to be placed in nursing homes, hospitals or other institutions? What will happen to elderly relatives who, perhaps through loneliness, may fall into bad health because relatives and neighbours no longer visit them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young couples, particularly in Dublin and its environs, are forced by economic necessity to go out to work. They are obliged to pay high mortgages and travel long distances to work. I speak from personal experience because my daughter who has a young baby lives in a semi-detached house, on which there is a high mortgage, between Bray and Greystones. The type of society in which she and other young people live in is far different from the one in which I was reared. People get up at 5.30 a.m. or 6 a.m., feed a young child, drop him or her to a crèche, get stuck in traffic for up to an hour and a half on <Col N="974" /> their way to work, arrive at 8.45 a.m., leave between 5 p.m. and 5.30 p.m., face into the traffic for another hour and a half, pick up their child and get home by 7.30 p.m. or 8 p.m. These couples, both of whom contribute to their child's welfare in terms of love and affection, are physically and mentally exhausted at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I am gravely concerned by the implication in our tax code that those who stay at home and do not avail of crèche services are, in some respect, lesser human beings. We must examine the human aspect of this issue. I want to live in a society where people have choices, not one which victimises those who take a certain route which may not be the most fashionable in the western world. One need only look at what is happening in other countries which have introduced similar codes to see their adverse consequences. Ireland has one of the highest rates of teenage drinking and that will increase if parents are not at home to supervise their children when they come home from school. I referred earlier to young babies, but what will happen when those children reach 10, 11, 12 or 13 years of age? Who will be at home to take care of them? </P>
    <P>Other Members may hold different views on this subject and they are entitled to do so. I do not believe, however, that the tax code should reflect adversely on those who choose to stay at home and take on the parental responsibilities people took on in the past. It is insulting to those who choose to stay at home and contribute to society in a voluntary manner to see the State implying that they are lesser human beings. I am opposed to this discrimination in the tax code. Those who go out to work should, certainly, be rewarded, but the same should apply to those who choose a different way of life and contribute services to society which, were they not provided voluntarily, would have to be funded by taxpayers.</P>

      <P>The amendments propose to increase various tax credits proposed in the Bill as follows: to increase the basic personal tax credit for a single person from £814 to £1,052 in 2001 and from 1,397 to 1,800 in 2002 and subsequent years; to increase the basic personal tax credit for married couples from £1,628 to £2,104 in 2001 and from 2,794 to 3,600 in 2002 and subsequent years; to increase the tax credit for an aged person from £238 to £438 &ndash; married &ndash; and from £119 to £219 &ndash; single &ndash; in 2001; to raise the tax credit of £238 in respect of an incapacitated child to £438 in 2001 and from 408 to 800 in 2002 and later years; and to increase the employee tax credit &ndash; formerly known as the PAYE allowance &ndash; from £296 to £533 in 2001 and from 508 to 914 in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a comprehensive discussion on the whole area of tax credits on Committee Stage. In response to identical proposals to increase the credits covered in the amendments, I reminded the committee that I had allocated £1,231 million <Col N="975" /> in the budget to fund cuts in personal income tax, almost £300 million more than in my previous budget which, in itself, was far in excess of anything that had previously been given in a single year, and nearly three times the amount promised under the PPF for this year, representing a very substantial cost and a further highly significant step in the fulfilment of the commitments set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>In keeping with that plan, this year's budget, as reflected in the provisions of the Finance Bill, continues to concentrate on the reform of the tax system which is designed to remove as many people on low incomes as possible from the tax net while at the same time significantly reducing the burden on those remaining within it. The increases in the personal tax reliefs of £800 for single persons and £1,600 for married persons and the doubling of the PAYE allowance to £2,000, announced in the December budget and shown as tax credits in the Bill, will result in standard rated personal allowances for single persons on PAYE of £7,500. When taken in conjunction with the changes in the tax rates and the standard rate band, there will be a significant reduction in the tax bill of all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>This area was discussed in some detail on Committee Stage. I noted the concerns raised by Deputies and, as indicated on Committee Stage, will, in particular, look at the question of the credit relating to the incapacitated child in the context of the next budget and Finance Bill. I understand the proposed increase in the employee tax credit, formerly known as the PAYE allowance, is aimed at exempting from income tax those persons earning only the minimum wage. The allowance was doubled in the December budget from £1,000 to £2,000. At the rate of 20%, this converts to a full year tax credit of £400 and to £296 in the short 2001 tax year, the figure included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>While calls for further increases are not unreasonable, in the three budgets prior to that introduced last December, I removed 176,000 low earners from the tax net; cut the burden on the lower paid in half; reduced the tax rate in many cases by up to 10 percentage points or more in the case of the low-paid, and did more than many other advanced economies in cutting taxes for single and married earners on low and middle incomes.</P>
    <P>Last December's budget, to which the Bill gives effect, increased the entry point to the income tax system to £144 per week. The figure was £77 per week when we entered office. A further 133,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net when the Bill comes into effect from 6 April, over 75% of the total exempted in the previous three years. There is no denying that this represents progress on a massive scale.</P>
    <P>I have announced previously that it is the Government's intention in the next budget to raise the entry point towards the level of the minimum wage. This will result in the removal of a further 150,000 taxpayers from the tax net. The <Col N="976" /> allocation of £1,231 million to fund cuts in personal income tax to which I have referred is generous by any standards. Realistically, I cannot accept proposals for further relief on top of amounts of the scale mentioned and must, therefore, oppose the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear one of the words. Did the Minister say that he wanted to raise the entry point towards the level of the minimum wage or to the level of the minimum wage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Towards the level of the minimum wage. Let me deal with the question raised by Deputy McGrath regarding the NCB study to which he referred on Committee Stage. The NCB concluded that increases in tax bands and allowances over the ten year period 1991 to 2001 had no more than matched corresponding income increases and the tax burden had more or less remained constant. The calculations done by the NCB were necessarily confined largely to historical figures up to 1997-98 which pre-date the significant tax concessions introduced in the 1999 and 2000 budgets. It appears that the NCB used growth in incomes over the period as the basis for measuring the tax burden compared with the traditional basis of using growth in the consumer price index as the benchmark for determining the minimum increases necessary in allowances and bands to keep the tax burden constant. The consumer price index, over the ten years to 2001 has grown by a cumulative 29% compared with income growth, on constant numbers, of about 70%. Clearly, tying the growth of tax bands and allowances to income increases instead of increases in the consumer price index would be much more expensive.</P>
      <P>It has sometimes been suggested that any increase in the total tax take automatically means that the burden of taxation is increasing. This is incorrect as the following example demonstrates. Let us assume that the expected inflation rate is 3% and the Government indexes the tax structure accordingly. Let us assume further that the taxpayer receives a pay rise of 3%, just maintaining the real value of his or her pay. The result is that the taxpayer has a higher income. While his or her tax bill has increased in monetary terms, as a percentage of total income, the tax bill remains constant. This means that there is no change in the overall burden of taxation. If the taxpayer receives an income increase greater than the increase in the consumer price index, it naturally follows that the nominal tax bill will increase accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the indicators of the tax burden is that aggregate tax, as a percentage of aggregate total income, fell from 22.5% in 1991 to 21.7% in 1997-98, based on historical revenue figures, and by a further 4.7% between 1997-98 and 2000-01, based on provisional figures. This confirms the relatively modest level of tax cuts in the first half of the 1990s and the much greater level of relief conceded in later years. The budget 2001 concessions <Col N="977" /> will reduce the proportion by a further 2%, which changes postdated the NCB commentary. If the 2000-01 tax regime had been replaced in budget 2001 by cumulative indexation of the 1991 exemption limits, allowances and rate bands, an increase of 29%, the cost to the Exchequer would have been £854 million or £309 million less than the corresponding elements of the 2000-01 budget scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath raised the question of what he termed the complicated certificates now being issued to employees which he states are causing confusion. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of queries received by the chief inspector's office about the new tax form known as the notice of determination of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point is not higher than normal. Like any new document, it will take time to become familiar with it. I readily expect that when people become aware of the reduction in their taxes in April, they will come to appreciate it. The document is a little more complicated than normal on two fronts: it shows the changeover to the tax credit system and that tax credits are reduced to 74% of the total in a full year due to the short tax year from 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001.</P>
    <P>When I spoke to people yesterday in an informal setting, it being a public holiday, I found that they have a good grasp of what tax credits are all about. In two or three years, they will be totally familiar with them and the system will be accepted. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of queries from taxpayers is not higher than normal, although Revenue offices are inundated with requests from foreign nationals for information on the tax system. They could do with personnel able to speak Chinese, Russian and other languages. The Deputies may find this amusing, but it is a fact that the numbers of inquiries from foreign nationals is growing.</P>

      <P>Most of the confusion arises from the second column on the form. There are two columns on the yellow form. One column shows the allowances at the 20% rate while the second shows them at the 40% rate. People are wondering where they stand and what their allowances will be. Someone who last year had a tax free allowance of £120 will now have a tax credit of £30 per week. They are worried as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not known as allowances any more. It is a simple calculation, depending on what one's income will be, say, £22,000, £36,000 or £56,000. The first £29,000 will be taxed at the rate of 20% as and from 6 April 2001. The balance will be taxed at 42%. From this one subtracts the total tax credits available to the person concerned. I accept that it is a different method and that people have got used to the tax allowance system over the past 40 years. The PAYE system was introduced in 1959-60 or <Col N="978" /> thereabouts. It will be a far simpler system when one gets the hang of it. I find that people usually get the hang of something quickly when it involves monetary deductions. The video and CD-ROM are available from the Revenue Commissioners and have been distributed to employers. I did not know that they had been distributed to Members. I had my son put it on for me at home in order that I could watch it. It is a very good video. I have not yet had an opportunity of saying to the unit in the Revenue Commissioners that produced it that it is an excellent video which explains the matter succinctly for employers. It will take time to get the hang of tax credits, but people will say that it is a much more efficient mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy visits his constituents at the end of April when they will have more money in their pockets, he will find that they are pleased with the tax changes in the budget.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath raised the issue of the numbers applying for the home carer's allowance. I said in reply to a parliamentary question from him on 28 November 2000 asking the number availing of the allowance that the figure up to 2 November 2000 was 114,600, which represented 61% of married couples who paid tax and where one spouse was earning and 30% of all married couples who paid tax. The corresponding information in respect of claimants who are self-employed taxpayers will not be available until self-assessment tax returns for the income tax year 2000-01 are received and recorded.</P>
      <P>People did not have to apply for the home carer's allowance. The Revenue Commissioners used the information available to them under the child benefit system and allocated the home carer's allowance to the majority of the 114,600 claimants. That is how most received the home carer's allowance. I am sure figures can be produced for the numbers who had to apply, but the vast majority appeared on the computerised child benefit records and automatically received the allowance as a result. Some were inadvertently omitted and later claimed it, but the bulk of recipients became aware that they would receive the allowance after they were informed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of low pay, there has been less criticism in recent months since I produced the figures for low pay. These were produced in <Col N="979" /> response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Jim Mitchell, when Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, requesting the different figures for the tax take for increasing strands of income and a comparison of the resultant figures for take home pay with similar figures for take home pay in the United Kingdom. As the Deputy will have noted, the net take home pay for low paid Irish taxpayers is much greater than the equivalent figure in the United Kingdom. The Irish tax system becomes severe for those in the middle, namely, middle income earners. I have tried in recent years, despite the opposition of Deputy McDowell, to have them pay a realistic amount of tax. When I complete the process in the budget for 2002, everyone will have benefited considerably. It is not possible to do it all in equal stages, but a transition to the tax credit system and having a single standard rate tax band will help everyone. The system for deducting the tax and social insurance take in Ireland is much better for the low-paid than that in any other EU country. An EU study complimented Ireland and the United Kingdom on their systems as compared with those in other EU countries, and the systems compare favourably with others in the rest of the world. I do not accept criticism in this area given the figures published which first came to light in the reply to Deputy Mitchell's question and also in the light of the EU report which placed them in context.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Mitchell raised the issue of the widening of the single standard rate tax band. I will not refer to the debate on the matter last year. While I agree with Deputy Barrett on many finance issues, I disagree fundamentally with him on this one. Up to and including the tax year 1980-81, there were many rates of taxation, but only one tax band which was not automatically doubled for married couples. It was only after that tax year that it was doubled. It was a feature of income taxation since it was introduced, although the participation of those in the workforce was much different, that the tax system had many rates, but only one band. It was an innovation in the 1981-82 tax year that the bands were doubled for married couples. No one has suggested to me that women were discriminated against from the foundation of the State until 1981. All my revolution amounts to is a reversion to that situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to the Fine Gael policy of continually increasing the employee tax credit as the poor man's way to individualisation. The Deputy's opposition to individualisation is not shared by his confreres in the labour movement. Since I became a Member of the House, those who support the Deputy's party, such as trade unionists and especially female trade unionists, have lobbied successive Governments long and hard to travel this road. The Deputy is aware of this and he would not find agreement in the wider labour movement for the proposition he has advanced. At least, he has been consistent in <Col N="980" /> arguing the point in the past 15 months, even though his view is not shared by many of his party colleagues and 98% of trade unionists and, certainly, not by any of the female trade unionists I know or have known, most of whom support the Labour Party. The Deputy is in a small minority on this issue. Nonetheless, he has been consistent and not said anything different.</P>
    <P>While Deputy McDowell has been consistent, the Fine Gael Party's proposal is not consistent. Increasing the PAYE allowance, now known as the employee tax credit, is the sneaky way to introduce individualisation. Deputy McDowell referred to it as the poor man's way to individualisation. The same effect would be achieved, but at less cost to the Exchequer. When Deputy Mitchell was Chairman of the then Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service up to 1997, I found him to be a very fair-minded individual. If he studies my proposals for widening the single standard rate tax band and considers what the end result will be, I will be surprised if he does not conclude that it is the fairest way given the current structure of society. It is a fair system and the fairest one to have. I only propose the widening of the single standard rate tax band, not the individualisation of the tax system.</P>
    <P>To individualise the tax system means that the personal allowance would be the same for a married couple with one person earning as for a single person. That is the system in the United Kingdom and in most other countries. The married tax free allowance is double the personal allowance for a single person, and in relation to tax credits it is double also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but Members have raised particular questions. That is what individualisation means in any accepted definition. It is the system that applies in other countries but I have never advocated that system. All I have decided to do, and this is accepted by the social partners, is to return to the system that operated up to 1981. When Deputy Mitchell investigates further, he will see individualisation as a fundamental change that is fair to everybody. Deputy Mitchell also raised the question of child care costs and he should agree that a widening of the tax bands is an effective way of addressing that question. The changes which will widen the standard rate band are fair and equitable.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell spoke about the balance struck between expenditure and taxation. There is a point where maximum return to the State is achieved, allowing it to increase expenditure in necessary areas. I cannot precisely say what the personal business tax rate should be to achieve that maximum point. However, my experience tells me that tax rates of 50%, 60% or 70% are not the optimum rates, whether in personal tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, gift tax or inheritance tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> I do not have a magic formula which tells me exactly what point is the optimum, but I know that high tax rates are not desirable. They are a disincentive to all and encourage evasion. Even if there is no evasion, very high tax rates discourage the maximum economic activity which gives the State the wherewithal to take the measures which all Members desire. That is a fundamental difference of political opinion between Deputy Mitchell and myself.</P>

      <P>Amendments No. 10 and No. 11 are designed to increase the PAYE allowance because there are costs involved in going to work for individuals, whether or not they are two individuals in a relationship. The Minister has tried to escape the implications of the Murray judgment in the Supreme Court. I doubt whether his proposals would survive a Supreme Court challenge. Has the Minister considered the Murray judgment in the context of his individualisation proposals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it but I am unsure whether the courts would uphold the opinion said to be expressed by the Attorney General. The proposals in amendments Nos. 2 to 11 should be taken together with the next set of amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right to say that middle income earners in the Republic are at a tax disadvantage. Those on lower pay fare better than those on low pay in Britain or Northern Ireland, but that does not mean that the position is over-generous here. It means only that the position is quite unkind in the UK. We should remember that in the UK council taxes must also be added which are not payable here. They do not appear on a person's payslip but are paid afterwards and worsen the tax position of UK citizens.</P>
      <P>If you compare the totality of discretionary or disposable income after taxes and PRSI it is true that Ireland has made great strides, but we still have a problem when it comes to those on middle incomes. In that sector more tax is still paid here than in the UK, a matter I will come to. These amendments are a way of dealing with the cost of going to work for both individuals and couples and I ask the Minister to consider them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal in what the Minister said which could detain us for the <Col N="982" /> rest of the night and beyond. On the debate about individualisation, the Minister rightly points out that some of my colleagues in the trades union movement do not agree with the analysis I put forward. It is the primary job of the trades union movement to represent workers whereas my party has a broader remit.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to disagree with most of the analysis put forward by Deputy Barrett. I am a bit younger than some of my colleagues who have spoken in this debate, and at a slightly different stage of the life cycle. I am at a stage when friends are having their second or third child and I have several female professional friends who have decided to opt out of work for a number of years to look after their children. I respect that choice, although I have been surprised by it in several individual cases as I never thought some of these friends would opt out of work. The doubling of the width of tax bands since 1981 has facilitated and supported that choice and to move in the opposite direction now will send out a contrary signal.</P>
      <P>What I have said about individualisation is not entirely in keeping with what other trades unionists have said, and I know some of the individuals the Minister refers to. However, there are others in the trades union movement who share my view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair also. I am unsympathetic towards the discussion we have had about taxation. One cannot discuss tax as if it is medicine that you take for no reason, something that is deeply unpleasant and has no positive sides. We should look at what type of investment in services the State needs and then look for the money to fund that investment. The level of current investment is inadequate and we must improve it. We have the surpluses and extra money available that would allow us to do that and they should be channelled towards investment in services.</P>
      <P>I am not arguing for 50%, 60% or 70% tax rates or anything remotely close to that. I disagree with some of the tax reductions the Minister has introduced largely because they have been inequitable and have disproportionately favoured the wealthy. That has been the primary argument between the Minister and me, and I suspect it will continue. The focus of my amendments is to ensure, in so far as taxes are being reduced, this will be done by way of tax credits.

      <P>refusing to meet the ASTI,</P>
      <P>the illegal manner in which pay was deducted from ASTI members, </P>
      <P>and bearing in mind the threat to the future of 60,000 leaving certificate and 60,000 junior certificate exam students and the long-term consequences for the fabric of the education system of a protracted dispute, calls on the Government to enter into immediate negotiations with the ASTI;</P>
      <P>and furthermore calls on the ASTI to co-operate immediately with the holding of the leaving and junior certificate examinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this motion, we in Fine Gael are clearly saying that the consequences of a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach by the Government are too enormous to contemplate, that instead of both sides to this dispute continuing, as they have done for the past ten days, in justification mode, it is high time both parties moved into direct dialogue and to facilitate this dialogue the ASTI should immediately co-operate with the holding of the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For every day this strike continues, enormous damage is being done. We should consider the plight of all the students, but primarily the 60,000 leaving certificate students. For 14 years they have worked their way through the education sys<Col N="986" /> tem, conscious from an early age that this juncture in their lives was a critical one, which in many respects would determine their future. Now all of a sudden factors outside their control are about to undermine all their studies and the most serious questions are being raised regarding the 2001 leaving certificate examinations. Will the examinations proceed and, if so, when? What will become of the oral, aural and practical examinations?</P>
    <P>To date the Minister has failed to outline and roll out in detail his contingency plans and to convince the public that the logistical arrangements are in place to facilitate the holding of these examinations. If these obstacles can be overcome, will scripts be corrected and, if so, by whom? Will those who will be designated as suitable to correct these examinations have the same skill as those who corrected examinations in previous years? When will the results be available? What about students who have been offered places in colleges in the United Kingdom contingent on leaving certificate examination results before the end of August? How will examiners factor in provision for the different levels of tuition received by students depending on their school and financial circumstances? Those are only some of the more immediate and obvious questions. The enormous additional pressure which all this uncertainty places on these students is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Sporadic student demonstrations demanding an end to this uncertainty have taken place throughout the country in recent days, except the Government has an agenda to smash the ASTI union and is intent on humiliating its membership into submission. It appears to me, as it does to the students, their parents and ASTI members throughout the country that the only way to make progress at this juncture is by having direct talks.</P>
    <P>While leaving certificate and, to a lesser extent, junior certificate students are the immediate victims, we should be aware that long-term damage is being inflicted on the education system. This damage is difficult to quantify, but when relationships break down at school gate level, as is inevitable, given the harsh words being exchanged through the media by representatives of all parties to this dispute, it will be very difficult to establish the relationship on the same basis of trust, respect and shared objectives.</P>
    <P>I was inundated over the weekend, as I am sure were my parliamentary party colleagues and other Members of this House, with representations from teachers and pupils who, by virtue of the Government's intransigence and incompetence to work to bring about a resolution to this dispute and the vacuum thus created by that reluctance, are squaring up to each other in the classroom and at the school gate. Herein are the seeds of destruction for our education system in the long term.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to a letter, which, in more succinct words, aptly gets to the heart of this message. I received this letter from <Col N="987" /> Loreto secondary school in Youghal, County Cork. It reads:</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Board of Management of this School, we would urge you as a public representative to do everything in your power to unblock the seemingly intractable difficulties which the country is now facing because of the continuing and worsening ASTI Industrial Action. Anxiety continues to deepen among pupils and parents. Traditionally good relations among school communities are becoming increasingly strained and it is now imperative that a solution be found immediately.</P>
    <P>In the eye of this storm the Minister for Education and Science headed for Malaysia, the Taoiseach is preoccupied with arrangements for a second U2 concert and the students will be home alone for two more days this week and three days next week. The contingency plans, which the Minister assured us would work, are disintegrating under the spotlight and not even the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is in sight to offer words of consolation to teachers out of the corner of his mouth &ndash; taxi drivers, one; leaving certificate students, nil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>Our education system, especially since the advent of free second level education, has served Ireland well. For historical reasons, probably going back to the era of the hedge schools, the teaching profession has been held in high regard in Irish society. As a consequence, we have benefited from a continuous stream of highly qualified and well motivated graduates making themselves available as teachers. As a result, our economy has prospered and many of the multinationals that locate their industries here cite the quality of the Irish education system and the graduates it produces as one of the main reasons for choosing to locate here far ahead of any of the tax or other incentives the country offers. However, we would do well to remember that this scenario cannot be taken for granted. Our successful economy is competing aggressively for graduates, offering larger salaries and less responsibility, but education and schools throughout the country are feeling the pinch. Secondary schools are witnessing unprecedented difficulties recruiting teachers. In certain subject areas, the alternative career options now available in the private sector mean that people are voting with their feet and subject choices have been withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is increasing evidence each year of people leaving the profession to pursue alternative careers and the Department's career break scheme is attracting increasing numbers. Allied to this startling problem, a large swathe of secondary teachers are progressing too slowly along an incremental salary scale that is too long and there <Col N="988" /> are not adequate prospects of promotion or recognition for those teachers. This is rapidly leading to a demoralised and poorly motivated profession. With the middle ranks stymied and the rejuvenation process for the profession faltering, we have the ingredients of a looming crisis in our schools in the medium to long term. It has manifested itself in some schools with restrictions on subject choices, not because graduates are scarce but because the alternative employment options are attractive.</P>
    <P>Unless remedial action is taken, it will not be long before the end product of our education system, the well rounded and well educated student, is in short supply and the knock-on benefits of the quality students and graduates we have had over the years, and the contingent benefits that has brought to our economy, will evaporate. This is what has been happening the teaching profession during the Minister's watch. It is not, contrary to popular opinion, all about the short working week and the long holidays. It is largely about job satisfaction. For many teachers this is becoming increasingly more difficult to find under the terms and conditions of their current employment. Potential teachers are simply walking away to take up more attractive alternatives.</P>
    <P>When contemplating how to resolve this dispute we would do well to remember what has happened to education in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America where, increasingly, a quality education can only be had at a considerable financial cost. The UK is obliged to import teachers from South Africa and elsewhere all over the globe, while some schools cannot provide adequate teaching cover for the full five day week. This is the whirlwind which we may yet reap unless we take urgent steps to make the career more attractive again.</P>
    <P>Another reason for this crisis in the classroom is the changed school environment over recent years and the feeling that teachers are isolated and on their own when dealing with the many social problems which now manifest themselves in the classroom. These problems &ndash; drug abuse, disciplinary difficulties, family breakdown and the increasing involvement of students in the workplace &ndash; are all serving to undermine the effectiveness of the teacher in the classroom and the Department of Education and Science has singularly failed to provide the necessary supports to both schools and individual teachers to cope with these additional pressures and demands for which their training has left them ill-equipped.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which the current dispute with the ASTI should be reviewed. Of course nobody is suggesting that the Government can give two fingers to congress, unilaterally breach the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness and snub the other two teacher trades unions, but the manner in which the Government has reacted to the democratic decision of ASTI members regarding its participation in Congress and regarding the PPF has progressed from initial <Col N="989" /> apparent indifference to the consequences to incompetence and ineptitude as the consequences became more apparent.</P>
    <P>The failure to recognise 15 months ago the significance of the ASTI decision has led us to where we are now. In all this time, no realistic attempt was made to face up to the issue in a meaningful manner. When the ASTI strike began to impact, the Government's decision to deduct pay for days when teachers, although available to teach, refused to supervise and boards of management, on good advice, closed schools for insurance related reasons was the real turning point in this dispute. From that day onwards previously moderate members of the trades union became hard liners and a difficult dispute became immeasurably more difficult to resolve as a result. If the pay deduction was a turning point, the intemperate and confrontational tone of the Minister, his predecessor who lectured us from the United States and the Taoiseach since the recent Labour Court ruling, has only served to stiffen the resolve of striking teachers not to be humiliated and ground into submission.</P>
    <P>This dispute is now in classic stalemate. An irresistible force meets an immovable object. As a result on a daily basis unacceptable pressure is mounting on examination students and long-term damage is being inflicted on the fabric of the education system. With both sides still resolutely in justification mode, the consequences, both immediate and long-term, are too catastrophic to contemplate.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael cannot accept the Government line that nothing can now be done to resolve this dispute short of an ASTI climb down. The stakes are too high and the consequences too enormous for this. Fine Gael now believes that the Government should convene a emergency meeting of the social partners to discuss the present crisis.</P>
    <P>Given the fact that the Labour Court has implicitly recognised that the ASTI has a sustainable case, consideration must be given to devising an alternative formula to benchmarking, the remit of which would be ring-fenced to ASTI members only and the operation of which would not compromise or undermine the claims being pursued by the INTO and the TUI in this fashion. Indeed, it is ironic that both the INTO and the TUI are processing higher pay claims than the ASTI, albeit in a different fashion, over a longer timeframe and through a PPF approved mechanism.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking has become the conflict zone in this dispute. The term to ASTI members, for one reason or another, is associated with Margaret Thatcher and the UK, with league tables and performance related pay. For others it is the equivalent of approaching an ATM. The reality is that no attempt was made by the Minister for Education and Science to sell the concept to those who opted out of the PPF until it was too late. Indeed, the rushed attempts late last year to bring forward payment dates and to fast track the establishment of the process served only to con<Col N="990" /> firm doubts of its whimsical nature up to that point. The meeting with social partners should also reconsider the issue of an up-front payment in the context of teachers' duties, supervision and substitution. We further believe that the Government should proceed as soon as possible, and by agreement, with the establishment of an education commission to consider all the non-pay elements in education which need radical review.</P>
    <P>The approach I have outlined offers a genesis of a solution. It recognises the difficulties of the parameters of the PPF while identifying scope in lateral movement within that context for a solution to emerge. The Government should convene this meeting of social partners as soon as possible and immediately thereafter meet with the ASTI. On this basis, the ASTI should lift its threat to the leaving certificate examinations, drop any threat of industrial action pending the outcome of these negotiations and commit itself to a full ballot of its members on any outcome from these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment to the motion will only further entrench both sides to this dispute. It refers to achievements under PPF and tax cuts, but it does not face up to the fact that the ASTI, by a democratic decision of its members, has removed itself from that and is seeking some mechanism to facilitate a resolution to its dispute. I cannot see how a resolution will emerge in the absence of dialogue. A resolution will not fall from the ceiling. Therefore it is incumbent on the Minister and on the Taoiseach to intervene directly at this stage.</P>
    <P>Although I have not consulted directly with the social partners, I believe that they would be amenable to finding a solution to this dispute. These, after all, are stakeholders in society. The education system is the cornerstone on which the successful economy of recent years is founded. It is in the best interests of the social partners that nothing is done to undermine the continued capacity of the education system to attract highly motivated graduates into the teaching profession and subsequently to supply the conveyor belt of high quality graduates which emerge from the third level institutions to fill the posts available in the economy.</P>
    <P>The only line in the Government's amendment from which one might take some comfort is the one which calls on the ASTI to work with the Government. How else can the ASTI work with the Government other than through dialogue with the Government? Nobody is suggesting that there is a preconceived outcome to these talks. Everybody must go into them with an open mind. The Government must, in the context of PPF, consult with the social partners, but there must be a willingness on both sides. Having consulted extensively with ASTI members, parents and pupils, I believe there is a willingness to compromise and settle. On that basis, the other side to this motion is quite implicit in so far as it places an equal obligation on the ASTI to respond to any goodwill gesture by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> As I said in my speech on a number of occasions, the consequences of digging in and of continuing to justify the position which has us in deadlock are too enormous to accept. Sooner or later somebody must facilitate dialogue. If it happens sooner rather than later, then the damage will be miminised and this year's leaving certificate and other certificate examinations can proceed but if the deadlock is long-term, the integrity of the examination system and the livelihoods of pupils sitting their leaving certificate will be undermined and that is too high a price to pay not to mention the long-term damage being inflicted on the education system as a result of this dispute.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline in detail his contingency plans? On previous occasions on Question Time, the Minister refused to roll out details on the basis that we were awaiting a Labour Court recommendation. It is becoming apparent that there is a cloud of serious magnitude hanging over the capacity of the Department to organise the examinations in the absence of&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to reply and to outline details.</P>
      <P>Given that other teacher unions have indicated that they do not want their members to get involved in carrying out what have been ASTI duties in the operation of examinations to date, I fail to see how these examinations can proceed. The Minister has not to date, in any meaningful way, squared up to the issue of the logistical problems associated with organising the practical, oral and aural examinations. Students who turn up to conduct oral examinations normally get a tape recorder from the school involved and a list of students to be assessed. If this is an ASTI school in which co-operation is lacking, it calls into question in a most serious way the capacity to carry out these examinations.</P>
      <P>At the core of this dispute are the 60,000 pupils who are at a crossroads in their lives. Continued self-justification will not assist these students &ndash; in fact, it will only serve to increase the pressure they are under. That is entirely unacceptable. I appeal to the Minister and the ASTI to be reasoned in their response to this debate and to facilitate dialogue as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion which condemns the Government's handling of the ASTI dispute to date. It is nothing short of an outrage that this Government and, in particular, this Minister for Education and Science have allowed a situation to develop where we now have an uncompromising stand-off between ASTI members and the Government with neither side seemingly willing to give an inch towards compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This dispute is not new and the Government cannot complain about a lack of sufficient time to <Col N="992" /> find solutions. The dispute has been simmering and steadily increasing in intensity for nearly 12 months. That teachers have not been satisfied with their pay and the concerns of the ASTI in relation to the principle of benchmarking have not taken this Minister by surprise, yet he has taken no successful, decisive action to bring this dispute closer to a resolution nor has he taken any action that has even improved relations between his Department and the ASTI. The truth is the opposite has happened. The most decisive action the Minister took in this dispute, which resulted in a dramatic deterioration of relations and an increase in tensions between both parties, was when he illegally deducted the pay of all ASTI members for the days when supervision was withdrawn before Christmas.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves in a stalemate where the ASTI has rejected the recent Labour Court recommendation and the Minister and the Taoiseach are refusing to even talk to the ASTI unless the talks begin entirely on the Government's own terms. The Taoiseach said during the Order of Business today that the Government will continue to do everything possible to resolve this dispute, yet he is not even willing to sit down and talk directly with the ASTI unless on his own terms. We, in Opposition, cannot stand by while this Government continues to try to grind the ASTI into submission by adopting a toughening out policy. A resolution must and will be found to this dispute sooner or later. Only the Government can ensure that it is sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The damage being done to students and their families as this dispute continues cannot be underestimated by anybody. Some 120,000 young students are in the final stages of preparation for leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations. With two more days of strike action planned by the ASTI this week, with three days planned for next week, with perhaps all out strike in weeks to come and with the potential refusal of ASTI members to co-operate with examination supervision and correction of State examinations, the whole fabric of our State examination system and our secondary education system as a whole is in danger of collapse this year.</P>
    <P>I remember better than most preparing for and sitting my leaving certificate. I clearly recall the worry and the pressure as the examination time drew closer. Students and their parents are on edge at this time of year anyway, particularly if they are involved in the leaving certificate. It is a time when they need support from the education system, not a breakdown. Do they not have enough with which to cope without wondering if their teachers will teach them next week or even if their examinations will go ahead as normal? It is the children, the students, who are the victims here because of the Government's decision to tough this one out until the ASTI gives in. Instead of looking for solutions, the Minister seems more intent on outlining how examinations will run without the ASTI, and he has not even done that comprehensively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> The long-term damage to the education system as a result of this dispute is very significant. The Minister will know that students' desperation and frustration are now turning to anger in certain parts of the country. Reports of leaving certificate students squaring up to their teachers in the schoolyard, the large crowd expected to march on Dáil Éireann tomorrow in protest and students walking out of their classrooms today in more than 30 locations around the country show just how damaging this dispute is becoming for our secondary school education system as a whole. If parents and their children continue to lose faith in the education system and its teachers, it may take years to rebuild the positive relationship between teachers and students that has been so beneficial to Ireland and its education system in the past.</P>
    <P>There is a huge imbalance between students affected by this dispute and those who are not and between students who can afford grinds and those who cannot. Time is of the essence in this dispute. Students' anger and frustration continue to grow, parents' anger is increasing by the day and teachers and the teaching profession are suffering massively. Everyone affected by this dispute is suffering but, in particular, the students. We, in Fine Gael, recognise the difficulties for the Government in any negotiations that may take place and that any resolution to this dispute should not threaten the wider partnership agreement. A resolution, therefore, is not straightforward. However, that does not mean that the uncompromising stance this Government is adopting can be justified. Like all disputes, negotiation is what is required if accommodation is to be found.</P>
    <P>I have said that time is of the essence. Both sides must begin the negotiations without preconditions because if the toughening it out mentality continues, the consequences, as my colleague, Deputy Creed, pointed out, will be dire for teachers, students and the education system as a whole. I call on the Minister to show some initiative and to get the talks going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>All teachers have made a major contribution to this country in their commitment to the education system. Outside their teaching duties, they have given an extraordinary commitment to voluntary activities both inside and outside the school. I have first hand experience of this. Great work has been done in the areas of sports, the arts, public speaking and so on. Every school has a number of teachers who are committed to extracurricular activities such as sport in addition to the PE teachers. Their commitment to sport has proved to be a great outlet for thousands of young people. There is now a great danger that this goodwill and voluntary effort may be lost forever because of this dispute. Few people acknowledge this contribution from teachers. On the contrary, they have been vilified by certain commentators in recent weeks. An embittered teaching profession would be a disas<Col N="994" /> ter for the education system and the Government is doing its best to create that. Our teachers are dedicated professionals and this contribution to society must be acknowledged and respected. That must also be the starting point in this debate.</P>
      <P>The nature of teaching and the daily routine of the classroom is now more demanding. Teachers must handle a wide range of social problems on a daily basis and these impinge greatly on their teaching. They carry a heavy work load. The 22 hours a week teacher is a myth. Teachers work well beyond their 22 hours class contact per week preparing class work, monitoring performance, attending meetings, arranging school events and so on, both inside and outside the school. They also take part in a wide range of in-service training.</P>
      <P>The dispute is deadlocked and it is not good enough for the Taoiseach to continue with his mantra, &ldquo;I will not speak to the ASTI&rdquo;. He has not been reluctant in the past to talk to every organisation in the country. If the Taoiseach opens discussions with the ASTI I am confident a fair compromise can be reached quickly. He has acknowledged that teachers will receive a salary increase. I saw him on television in a report from Washington in which he said they would get their increase. The Labour Court also acknowledges this.</P>
      <P>An up-front goodwill payment to all teachers will break the deadlock and their co-operation with the examination system will be secured. I appeal to the Taoiseach for the sake of all parents and students, especially those facing examinations, to begin talking now and help to resolve this crisis in our education system.</P>
      <P>Teachers are by their nature conservative and do not wish to be on the picket lines. The Government has responsibility and it must act. There is no room for further prevarication and intransigence on the part of the Government. As Deputies Creed and Coveney stated, the Government has succeeded in turning parent on teacher and pupil on teacher but the Minister should remember that they could both turn on him next week. He should not underestimate the problems ahead for the Government. There is genuine concern regarding the political ramifications of what is happening within Government and no doubt the Minister will react to the dispute later this week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Creed has proposed a solution which gives a way out to the Government. For the sake of leaving certificate students, it should be taken. Shortly, parents and students may turn on the Government. The bottom line is the Minister will not admit the oral examinations cannot take place without the ASTI and the examination papers will not be corrected without their expertise. The oral examinations cannot be run without ASTI teachers and the written examinations will not be corrected without them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should accept Deputy Creed's solution. He should talk to the teachers and give <Col N="995" /> both sides a way out, otherwise the Minister will stand indicted in the future when people look back on this period and examine how he coped with the dispute and the damage he did to the education system.</P>

        <b>:</b> Ní neart go cur le chéile. Tá an sean-fhocal sin oiriúnach, ní hé amháin don stailc féin ach do réiteach na ceiste chomh maith.

      <P>It is as clear as a pike staff that discussions must take place if this strike is to end. I do not know why anybody should have to explain that. If the strike continues for another 12 months or two years it will still take face to face negotiations to bring it to an end. There is no advantage in going through the pros and cons of the dispute in public. It is enough to know there is a strike, students and parents are seriously upset by it and, despite what some cynics might say, teachers are also upset.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate examinations are only a few weeks away and supervision and marking of the examinations must be organised properly. I refuse to accept at this late stage that the correction of examination papers can be done without teachers, despite the comments of some interviewers on our national airwaves who rushed in where angels and Ministers feared to tread.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Taoiseach who has earned a reputation as a great settler of disputes is now on his own form of strike action by refusing to meet a group which holds different views to him in regard to the PPF. Is it not incredible that on something as difficult as that, he has one view and the ASTI has another? The Nationalists and Unionists in the North hold different views, yet, to the Taoiseach's credit, he has gallantly battled to try to get them around the table to negotiate but because he has a different view to the ASTI he has said he will not talk. Earlier he outlined all that has been done in regard to this dispute and said that he would be prepared to meet the ASTI within five minutes if it raised the white flag. That is not the way to negotiate. The Taoiseach has skills beyond such a line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1913 lock-out occurred when trades unionism was in its infancy and when domination rather than discussion ruled the day. Times have changed and nowadays workers no longer come out with their hands in the air in abject surrender. Only last November at the launch of a book by Padraig Yeates on the 1913 lock-out the Taoiseach stated: &ldquo;The 1913 Lockout was an early demonstration of mutually destructive employer and trade union power. We have moved an immense distance since those days&rdquo;. How far have we moved when there is a deadlock in the current dispute? I do not wish to make an exact <Col N="996" /> comparison between the 1913 Lockout and this strike. The Labour Court, which said the teachers had a justifiable claim for an increase in salary and then told them to accept what they had already turned down, may have been tied by guidelines, but, as a result, its findings were not of any benefit in terms of getting ASTI members off the picket lines.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate examination is the gateway to every student's future. Some may cope with the trauma of the strike but many will not achieve their full potential. For their sakes, I ask for common sense to prevail so that this strike can be called off. A meeting is not difficult to arrange nor is a frank exchange of views and a suggestion about the future may be all that is needed to permit a return to work.</P>
    <P>Using the PPF as an excuse for not holding talks is akin to the shout of &ldquo;No surrender&rdquo;. I ask the ASTI members who have made clear their willingness to talk, to accept this meeting as a gesture of goodwill on the Government's part and to call an end to the threat to this year's examinations. The students have endured enough. Let us get down to the serious business of talking through this problem. It must happen sometime and therefore, instead of continuing to make shapes, let us make proposals.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;commends the Government and the Minister for Education and Science for their efforts to resolve the ASTI dispute, including the provision, in conjunction with the social partners, of increases amounting to 22.6% for teachers together with a 10% reduction in personal taxes and, for the first time, a benchmarking process through which public servants can obtain further pay increases by comparison with graduate entry employment groups in the private sector; and further commends the Government for its determined and continuing efforts to bring about a resolution of this dispute through every industrial relations procedure available, including conciliation, independent arbitration, facilitation by the Labour Relations Commission and, ultimately, a full hearing by the Labour Court; and for its agreement to establish a forum on education and the changing role of teachers as recommended by the Labour Court: and calls on the ASTI to work with the Government and the social partners to obtain their objectives and to co-operate immediately with the holding of the leaving and junior certificate examinations.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the ASTI Central Executive Council to reject the Labour Court recommendation without referral to a ballot among the association's general membership and to embark on industrial action and a campaign to undermine <Col N="997" /> the examinations process is incomprehensible to most right-thinking people. Our first duty as a Government is to protect the future of our second level students and especially those who are sitting State examinations this year. We will continue to do everything in our power to resolve this dispute in association with the national partners. We have been patient and have made every effort, both behind the scenes and through the industrial relations processes, to find a solution but every proposal for settlement in harmony with the social partnership and the PPF has so far been rejected by the leadership of the ASTI. We have now reached the 11th hour and in the interests of this year's exam students I had no choice last week but to begin to put our contingency plans for the examinations into operation.</P>

These plans were outlined by me to my Government colleagues on Tuesday last and the Government decided to establish an interdepartmental examinations implementation task force to oversee the administration of the contingency plans and to pursue the conduct of the public examinations on the basis of the contingency plans commencing with the advertisement for superintendents. The task force held its first meeting this morning and advertisements for superintendents appeared in today's newspapers. I understand the response is overwhelming.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, the Government will continue its efforts to resolve the dispute and to ensure that this year's exam students are given the support they deserve. This problem began when the ASTI decided to break away from the social partners, reject the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which guarantees fair treatment and a share in the nation's prosperity for all sectors of Irish society, and leave the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. All sides in this House endorsed the social partnership and recognised the vital role of the social partners in charting the way forward for our economy and for our people in the increasingly open and challenging times that lie ahead. We have provided through social partnership the jobs and opportunities our children need, an end to forced emigration, the return of many families from abroad to worthwhile occupations, new investments in education and health and equality and unprecedented growth and prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People all around the world are wondering how the Irish people have done it. It is really very simple, we did it through social partnership with everybody pulling together. Ireland will continue to prosper and provide opportunities for our children if we learn from the lessons of the recent past and work out our difficulties through a part<Col N="998" /> nership in which everybody contributes and everybody gains. We cannot allow a situation to develop in which the leadership of one union, the ASTI, can undermine the social partners and wreck the PPF. The ASTI has been assisted by its own conciliation and arbitration process, the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission and finally by a full hearing of the Labour Court. The efforts of all these have been rejected out of hand by their leadership.</P>
    <P>The ASTI leadership continues callously to pursue its demands for special and preferential treatment for their members above and beyond the majority of teachers and all other public servants and are prepared to jeopardise the future of the most vulnerable second level students, the examination students, in reckless pursuit of that claim. The Labour Court, which is the single most experienced independent national forum in dealing with industrial relations disputes, was asked to consider both the union's claim in respect of the ASTI teachers' pay and the position of the Departments of Education and Science and Finance in relation to public service pay policy and to make recommendations for the resolution of the dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The court concluded that the claim for an up-front payment for ASTI members is not justified, according to the Labour Court, as they have benefited from the PPF increases amounting to 8.5% to date and increasing to 16% by 1 October 2001. By 1 October next an ASTI member holding an honours degree and an honours H. Dip, with ten years service, will have received an up-front payment of £4,488 under the PPF. When the PPF is concluded, teachers will have received a total increase in pay amounting to a massive £295 million. The court's view is that these payments can be viewed as up-front payments as the ASTI is not party to the PPF. The Government also agreed that 25% of any increase arising from benchmarking will be paid with effect from 1 December next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court considered the issues in relation to compensation for the cost of living, increased pay in respect of past productivity and flexibility have been addressed in national agreements by pay increases, tax concessions and a number of special awards to teachers over the years. The court considered that the ASTI arguments in relation to the contribution of ASTI teachers to the success of the economy can be made by many other groups also and the court did not uphold the ASTI claim on these grounds. The court also concluded that teachers have a sustainable case for a pay increase by comparison with other graduate entry employment groups and that the bench<Col N="999" /> marking process being used by other teacher and public service unions to measure the value of jobs and responsibilities is the most appropriate mechanism to evaluate that aspect of the ASTI case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The court found it difficult to accept that the ASTI teachers' case was unique in that other teacher unions and others within the education system have accepted this process as a means of addressing their not inconsiderable claims.</P>
      <P>In its formal recommendations, the court went on to say that the ASTI should process its claim for recognition that teachers' pay is depressed by comparison with other graduate entry employment groups through the benchmarking process. In this respect, the court highlights the developments which have taken place in relation to the benchmarking process since the ASTI originally rejected it as an acceptable process. It notes in particular that, first, the benchmarking body will not be recommending the introduction of performance-related pay &ndash; this was one of the concerns expressed by the ASTI leadership; second, it is a totally independent body presided over by a High Court judge; third, it has a substantial budget, a full-time secretariat and resources for independent research and will be able to evaluate each case on its merits and on the basis of its research findings in a fair, equitable and objective way; and the Labour Court also notes that 25% of any increase arising from benchmarking will be paid with effect from 1 December 2001 &ndash; the original proposal was that no payments would be made during the period of the PPF.</P>
      <P>The court also recommended that an expert review of education be undertaken involving all the partners in education covering a wide range of areas, including legal and management structures, developments in education, the role of the teacher, teacher training and accreditation and support systems in schools. The terms of reference to be agreed between the partners and the review body are to be in place by 1 June 2001. The Government has accepted this recommendation and authorised me to proceed with its implementation.</P>
      <P>Third, the court recommended that, as a gesture of goodwill and without prejudice, on acceptance of its recommendations by the ASTI, pay should not be deducted for the five &ldquo;days of action&rdquo;, that is, the days during which teachers withdrew from supervision and substitution.</P>
      <P>At this point, I wish to put on record the appreciation of the Government for the expertise, professionalism and diligence with which the Labour Court conducted its investigation of and deliberation on this claim. It has upheld the highest standards of integrity and independence for which it is universally acclaimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the ASTI leadership to target the examinations process by withdrawing from <Col N="1000" /> the supervision and marking of examinations and attempting to classify anyone who undertakes this work as &ldquo;strike breakers&rdquo; is extraordinary and shows the ruthless intent of the ASTI leadership.</P>

      <P>ASTI members are employed on a contract to teach by various boards of management and they have been processing a 30% pay claim in respect of that employment. ASTI members enter into contracts with the Department of Education and Science each year in respect of the supervision and/or marking of the leaving and junior certificate examinations. This is a separate contract with a different employer which is not connected in any way to the teaching contract and which is remunerated separately. There is no dispute in relation to this contract. However, the ASTI has decided, without a specific ballot of members contracted for the examination work, to withdraw from any involvement in examinations work, effectively taking secondary industrial action in relation to a dispute with another employer. Whatever about the legal status of such action, the attempt to categorise as &ldquo;strike breakers&rdquo; those people who take up work which ASTI members have not volunteered to contract for is unworthy of a professional organisation and amounts to bullying tactics.</P>

My officials will maintain regular and close contact with them to keep them fully informed of the contingency arrangements and to identify with them specific roles that they may play in assisting our efforts and in supporting the students through this difficult time.</P>
    <P>All right thinking citizens of this country must question the motives and actions of the ASTI leadership. Two independent bodies have examined and rejected ASTI claims for separate, pre-emptive treatment for its pay claim. The Labour Court pointed out that ASTI members will have received an up-front payment amounting to 16% by I October next. In addition, they will receive 25% of any increase from benchmarking with effect from 1 December next. The Labour Court upheld ASTI's assertion that its members merit a pay increase on its claim that its members have fallen behind other professions in recent years but held that the benchmarking body was the appropriate forum for processing their claim.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court recommended, and the Government accepted, that an expert review of education be undertaken involving all partners in education and that the review should cover a wide range of issues. I consider that such a review is timely and I am making preparations for an expert and broad ranging review of education to take place. ASTI has cynically targeted students sitting State examinations by curtailing teaching time between now and Easter and by overtly threatening arrangements to hold examinations without ASTI teachers.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Creed, we are working closely with the social partners and with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions every day and we will continue to do that. We are working absolutely and completely with the social partners and with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions every day and I will continue to do that.</P>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach wrote to ASTI in response to the association's request for his personal intervention. The Taoiseach told the ASTI that the State will conduct its examinations to the best of its abilities. ASTI may feel able to abandon the students in this predicament, the Taoiseach wrote, but the Government will not.</P>

Some of those meetings seemed to have reached positions where a solution might be achieved. However, the ASTI negotiators seemed unable to convince the leadership to grasp the opportunities for resolution. It is clear to all at this point that the sole concern of the ASTI leadership is their 30% pay claim over and above the terms of the PPF. They do not seem to care who suffers in the process <Col N="1004" /> of achieving their aim, nor do they seem to care whether their claim is justified in the wider national context or if the national interest is damaged.</P>

      <P>The aspect of the dispute which ordinary people find most difficult to understand is not the teachers' demand for better pay but the refusal by the ASTI to have that aspect of their claim for a pay increase based on comparison with other graduate employment examined and adjudicated on by the same independent body and subject to the same procedures as the other public service unions, including the other teacher unions. That is a particular difficulty for the ASTI. The public service benchmarking body, as agreed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is the ideal body to examine this aspect of the ASTI claim. Anybody could understand if the ASTI were not satisfied at the end of the process that they might embark on this action. It is very difficult to understand why they would embark on it before the process is undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Benchmarking is basically about comparing public service pay and jobs with pay and jobs <Col N="1005" /> across the economy with a view to ensuring that public service pay rates compare favourably with comparable employment in the private sector. The unions have fought hard to establish this principle. This was the objective of the Government and of the public service unions in framing the benchmarking process and establishing the public services benchmarking body. The benchmarking exercise involves much more than a pay review in the traditional sense. One of the difficulties is that a great many people either do not understand what benchmarking is or decide not to want to understand it. As well as examining rates of pay the benchmarking body will examine and compare existing roles, duties and responsibilities in the public service and across the economy. This is designed to ensure that it does not look simply at pay rates applicable to jobs with similar titles but looks at the jobs themselves to establish how comparable they are.</P>
    <P>In undertaking its research it also has to have regard to differences between the public service and the private sector and also between different groups in the public service in working conditions, in the way work is organised, in conditions of employment and other benefits and in the area of responsibility which is of enormous interest to teachers. The benchmarking body will examine the jobs as they currently exist and actually operate in practice. They will seek to compare them to similar jobs in the private sector and also compare the reward packages applying to both. The benchmarking body has not been mandated to recommend an introduction of individual performance related pay. This is one of the difficulties put forward to a lot of rank and file teachers. I understand, as a former teacher, why they have reservations about it. Public service employers and unions recognise that even if one wished to introduce elements of performance related pay this could only be done when a performance management system is in place and functioning. Even then it would be difficult.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking is about ensuring that the public service can compete fairly to recruit, retain and motivate its staff. It is a matter of extreme and pressing interest to the State. The benchmarking body will be able to evaluate each case on its merits and on the basis of its research findings. In this way its work is similar to the exercise carried out for many years by the review body on higher remuneration in the public service where, for example, the pay of Members of the Oireachtas and senior public servants has been compared to pay rates applying to similar jobs in the private sector and in the most recent review, in the case of the Oireachtas, with the public sector. Many of us have heard people complaining bitterly on the media about the success of Oireachtas Members with the last round of the review body. At the same time they steadfastly refuse to benefit from the same system themselves. It flies in the face of common sense and reason.</P>

      <P>The body will not seek to introduce pay for productivity. While employers may seek certain changes, there is no obligation on the body to accept them. It is open to the unions to raise their own issues. There are issues which need to be raised by teachers. One would expect the unions to pursue the issue of pay for supervision, which is something many teachers feel crept in and they are not paid for it. There is a place to argue that case. The public services benchmarking body is a totally independent body chaired by a High Court judge. The composition and terms of reference of the body were agreed by the Government and the public service unions. The body has resources to do a particular job and, as the Minister explained, there is already an agreement that 25% of whatever is agreed will be paid from 1 December. It has its own research programme and will be able to evaluate scientifically the case made by all the people making submissions. Written submissions have already been sought and they intend to hear oral submissions in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The leaving and junior certificate examinations are due to commence in 77 days. At this point in the academic year it is normal for examination students to be anxious but, for the class of 2001, that anxiety has been surpassed by huge distress and anger, of which we will witness more in coming days. The dispute between members of the ASTI and the Government has reached a pitiful new low. Positions on both sides <Col N="1007" /> have become deeply entrenched and it is the entirely innocent victims of the dispute, examination students, who are suffering most. With only ten weeks to go before one of the most important challenges of their lives, they do not even know whether their examinations will proceed. How can these young people be expected to do themselves any kind of justice, faced with so many lost teaching days and such complete uncertainty about their futures? </P>
      <P>There is a narrow window of opportunity for action to be taken to resolve the dispute, but it will only be available for a short time. If the dispute continues beyond next week, there is no doubt, but that it will result in very heavy casualties among students and teachers alike and it will, ultimately, be the Minister who will pay the price.</P>
      <P>From the outset the Government's approach to the dispute has been incredibly irresponsible. The Government was elected to run the country. Government should provide good leadership and ensure essential rights such as the constitutional right to education are available to all citizens. However, the megaphone diplomacy in which the Taoiseach engaged when he sought to lecture teachers through a series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> did not display leadership, but was, instead, an exercise in complete arrogance. The Taoiseach appears to have decided to embark on a personal crusade against the ASTI, regardless of the consequences of that action. Equally, the Minister for Education and Science has neglected the national interest in his serious mishandling of the dispute. His contribution this evening was in the same vein and will further inflame teachers' anger and annoyance.</P>
      <P>The Minister has sought to provoke teachers from the outset and proved himself to be incompetent. He acted unlawfully in accessing lists of ASTI members for the purposes of withholding pay, but was, ultimately, forced to repay the money. His actions significantly soured the entire atmosphere of the dispute and made militants of many formerly moderate teachers. The Minister also damaged relations at an early stage in the dispute by announcing to the media before Christmas that his Department was engaged in contingency examination plans. This act demonstrated the lack of any serious will on his part to find a resolution to the dispute. Had the Minister applied himself seriously to solving the dispute in its initial stages rather than preparing for a more deadlocked position, the current situation might never have arisen.</P>
      <P>Among the litany of the Minister's actions which angered teachers, parents and students, the one which caused the greatest outrage was his decision to travel to Malaysia and Singapore last week for St. Patrick's Day celebrations.</P>

      <P>Let me turn my attention to possibilities for a resolution. While Deputy Creed's proposal is a sound one and has potential, there are other options. When the ASTI voted to stay out of the national agreement, it was greeted with what has now become a Government mantra. Its members were told that they were obliged to pursue their claim through the PPF and the benchmarking body. While it may prove very inconvenient and make life difficult for the social partners, a group of workers has a constitutional right to pursue a pay claim and there is an onus on the Government to ensure a mechanism is in place whereby such a claim can be pursued. There is no such mechanism in this instance.</P>

      <P>While &ldquo;benchmarking&rdquo; has become something of a buzz word, it should be remembered that when it was signed up to as part of the PPF last year, few people knew what it entailed. It has yet to be fully explained and to prove itself as an effective mechanism for linking productivity with rewards. There is still much uncertainty as to what precisely benchmarking involves. In many ways, the scope of the benchmarking body has been broadened, thanks to the ASTI, but it is still a largely unknown quantity.</P>
      <P>It has been broadly accepted by most that the Labour Court has failed to deliver anything new or tangible for the ASTI.

The hard-line position adopted by the Government offered no possibility of flexibility or a down payment. The Minister's hard-line position ensured that the Labour Court was not able to come up with any new initiative and that was deeply disappointing to everyone, including his own party's backbenchers.

      <P>These are very critical days for the Waterford Airport company. They may well have <Col N="1010" /> to cease operations unless the Government provides the type of subvention which they are seeking, approximately £500,000. What is being offered to the company conditionally is a marketing grant of £165,000, that being contingent on local contributions to the amount of about £335,000. This is not a runner. Local industry and local authorities in the region have been giving the company considerable support over a number of years and they cannot go on doing so indefinitely. The amount of money involved is quite considerable. We have been very unlucky in Waterford in that the carriers engaged over a number of years have not retained the franchise as we would have wished. British Regional withdrew the daily service on 5 January last. The timing of the application for a sizeable grant of half a million pounds is particularly opportune and the Government should treat it as such.</P>
      <P>The new carrier engaged by Waterford Regional Airport, Euro-Celtic, happens to be a very compatible operation for Waterford Airport. The proprietor of the company has local connections with the south-eastern region. The company are particularly happy with the performance of the service since it was inaugurated on 14 February, 2001, just over one month ago. The flight frequency is one flight a day but it is intended that from 14 May this carrier will operate two flights per day from Waterford to Luton. However, to underwrite this operation will require the sort of money I spoke about, that is, £500,000.</P>
      <P>What is being offered in a letter from the assistant secretary of the Department of Public Enterprise is a marketing grant of £165,000, and that is conditional. That is not sufficient and I am asking that the Minister for Public Enterprise sit down with the board of Waterford Regional Airport and work out a system to enable the airport to become viable. It will become viable with the involvement of the present carrier if it is given the necessary support. Further support has been promised by Waterford Corporation and by Waterford County Council and local industry. The amount of money involved is so considerable that we need substantial Government aid.</P>
      <P>Waterford's main difficulty over the years has been access. The roads and the railway are all substandard. It takes two and a half hours to get from Waterford to Dublin by rail and it is less than one hundred miles in distance. It takes the same time to get from Cork to Dublin and that is a distance of 160 miles. The road is hugely inferior and we can ill-afford to lose one of our most valuable assets, access by air to the south-eastern region. I am pleading with the Government to ensure that the airport does not go down, that the company does not have to fold up. The Government must bear in mind that there are over 35 jobs involved and half a million pounds is not a lot of money.</P>

      <P>Waterford Regional Airport is facing closure at the end of the month unless it can secure £500,000. The Minister's Department has <Col N="1011" /> indicated that £165,000 in marketing support could be allocated very quickly if the Department could be assured that the balance of the half million pounds needed for this would be forthcoming to the airport. The Department of Public Enterprise has suggested to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that, given the principal beneficiaries of the existence of the airport are local industry and commercial interests, some of whom use the airport for their privately-owned or chartered aircraft, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment agencies should contribute some or all of the necessary £335,000 with local commercial interests also contributing, in order to support the airport at least for the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>Last Friday morning, I sent fax messages to the Taoiseach' office, the office of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the office of the Minister for Public Enterprise, the office of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the office of the chief executive of IDA Ireland and the chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, seeking in each case urgent intervention to secure the future of Waterford Regional Airport. It is absolutely unthinkable that Waterford Regional Airport should close in 11 days from now. The blow to Waterford and the south-east region would be inestimable but the effect on morale would be profound. There must be Government intervention.</P>
      <P>The British Regional service which operated a daily return flight to the UK ceased on 5 January 2001. This service was discontinued because of changes of aircraft and schedules in British Regional. There is now a new airline, Euro-Celtic, which has received the appropriate licence and the service is currently operating. The best estimates in regard to the cost of annual support services is £500,000 to guarantee continuity of service. If Waterford Regional Airport is granted a public service obligation licence, this should add £300,000 to the airport's finances. The foot and mouth disease scare is certainly also affecting Waterford Regional Airport. It is incumbent on the Government not alone to assist Waterford Regional Airport through its present crisis but to put it on a footing to secure its future. At a time when the Taoiseach is flinging tens of millions of pounds in all directions in reckless fashion to ensure the Stadium Ireland project goes ahead, surely his Government can provide sufficient funds to ensure the survival of Waterford Regional Airport, bearing in mind its pivotal role in the development of Waterford and the south-east region.</P>
      <P>There are 35 individuals or whole-time equivalents currently employed at the airport. There are 18 direct employees. There are also implications for the marine rescue centre. Waterford Regional Airport must be saved and I look to the Minister to ensure that this happens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, is aware of the financial position of Waterford Airport and senior officials of her Department have been in recent contact with the chairman of the board of the airport regarding the situation. As the Deputies are aware, Waterford Airport is a commercial enterprise and, like all the regional airports, there is no element of State ownership in the facility. Decisions on any of the regional airports are ultimately a matter for the shareholders and management boards of those airports.</P>
      <P>The financial situation at Waterford Airport is not an entirely new phenomenon and predates any additional difficulties arising from the recent national campaign to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. Among the six regional airports, Waterford has experienced a steady decline in passenger numbers over the past five years, falling from in excess of 23,000 in 1995 to under 16,000 in 2000. All the other regional airports have succeeded in increasing their passenger throughput over that period, including Donegal and Sligo airports, which are comparable in terms of passenger numbers with Waterford.</P>
      <P>Within the Government's commitment towards supporting the regional airport network, the Minister for Public Enterprise substantially increased the funding she provided for marketing and promotional efforts to Waterford Airport in 1999. Prior to that, Waterford had, for a number of years, been allocated an annual marketing grant of £40,000. In 1999, however, in recognition of the difficulties the airport was experiencing at the time, the grant to Waterford Airport was almost quadrupled to more than £150,000. Despite that substantial increase, passenger throughput fell again at Waterford by approximately 1,000 passengers in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, out of a total budget for marketing support of £1.5 million, Waterford Airport was again allocated a very substantial sum of £155,000 by the Department of Public Enterprise. The budget allocation model is based loosely around the passenger throughput at the six regional airports, but it took special account of the position of the three smaller airports at Waterford, Donegal and Sligo by setting a minimum &ldquo;floor&rdquo; of £100,000 to the level of support for marketing activities. Even allowing for that, however, Waterford Airport enjoyed an allocation which was 50% higher than that for Donegal and Sligo, and its allocation last year was 25% greater than that for Galway Airport which handles five times more passengers than Waterford. Again, however, passenger numbers using Waterford Airport declined further last year. In treating Waterford Airport in this favourable manner in recent years, we were able, up to a point, to take account of its special circumstances. This took account of the threatened loss last year of the service provided by British Regional Express to London and our understanding that the financial <Col N="1013" /> difficulties of the airport were temporary in nature.</P>
    <P>While the Department of Public Enterprise will continue to provide support to assist with marketing and promotional activities, it is not appropriate to provide direct operational subsidies to the regional airports. Beyond a certain level of support for marketing purposes, a stage is reached when we risk straying into the area of operational subsidies for a particular airport. Out of this year's budget for marketing support which, at £1.5 million, is the same as last year's, the Minister for Public Enterprise is prepared to allocate a further sum of £165,000 to Waterford Airport. While this again will be substantially more than that justified by a <i>pro rata</i> allocation model based on passenger throughput, the Minister is prepared to sustain this high level of support this year in recognition of the airport's difficulties and also in the context of supporting the new service to London which was commenced recently by Euroceltic.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware, however, that the airport authorities have indicated a much greater level of support is required this year and annually to maintain airport operations. The level of financial assistance which Waterford Airport has indicated it needs to remain in operation is out of all proportion to what is available from the Department of Public Enterprise for the other regional airports. Our proposal to allocate a sum of £165,000 for marketing activities is, therefore, in the context of the balance of the airport's requirements being found from other sources, for example, local industrial and commercial interests, some of whom I understand use the airport for their privately owned or chartered aircraft. The Department of Public Enterprise also suggested to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that it or the development agencies under its aegis should provide support to Waterford Airport, at least for the remainder of this year. The Minister believes that, within the policy constraints which her Department operates in terms of funding for the regional airports, her proposed allocation to Waterford Airport for marketing support this year is generous, as it has been for the past two years.</P>
    <P>It is for the shareholders and the board of Waterford Airport to decide on its future potential viability. In reaching its decision, the board will no doubt have regard not just to the possibilities for sustaining scheduled air services but also to the commercial prospects for other activities, such as the further development of private executive aviation, pilot training and the possibility of search and rescue services which the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources may wish to position at the airport. However, if, having considered the difficult financial position and the prospects for the future of scheduled air services, the board decides to cease operations at the airport, notwithstanding the level of assistance the Department of Public <Col N="1014" /> Enterprise is prepared to offer, this will be disappointing.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Purchase for Destruction Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not want to engage in the specifics of the exchanges between the Minister and the Food Safety Authority, a large cohort of consumers thought the purchase for destruction scheme was a measure to counter BSE. It is no surprise the perception was one of consumer protection when one reads the press release from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the matter. It reads: &ldquo;The measures were negotiated at EU level and were designed to restore consumer confidence and to provide an effective floor for the market for cattle&rdquo;. Priority in the statement is given to consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>The scheme to date has commanded a spend of approximately £135 million. This money has been set aside without a murmur as a market support mechanism. The recent dispute between the Minister and the Food Safety Authority revolves around the culling of animals and the allocation of funding associated with the scheme. Whatever the intention of the purchase for destruction scheme, there was undoubtedly a perception that the scheme was intended as a consumer protection tool. Consumers can be forgiven for believing the meat they saw nightly on prime time television being slashed and sprayed with green dye was unfit for human consumption and was being removed from the food chain because it presented a risk to human health.</P>
      <P>In reality, the animals were slaughtered and the carcasses sprayed with green dye and put in a skip to be incinerated so that the beef market could be supported. The entire destruction process had nothing to do with food safety. The cost so far of this market support mechanism is in the order of £135 million. This money has been made available without a whimper of disagreement. Some of it comes from the Exchequer and the remainder from Europe. I do not hear a comparable support mechanism being wheeled in to support the tourism or catering industries or the many sporting organisations that have suffered on account of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To compound matters, it appears the wrong animals have been targeted in the purchase for destruction scheme. If consumer confidence is to be restored, older animals and those known to be epidemiologically most at risk of being infected should be first to be slaughtered. That approach would at least allow the possibility of removing BSE from the national herd and, at the same time, reducing the risk of infected meat getting on to the market. Surely the objective is to provide a safe product for the domestic and export market. Safe food and strong markets are entirely compatible, and the strongest marketing tool is to be able to say our product is safe. We would be able to go some distance towards saying that if the most suspect animals were targeted and removed. <Col N="1015" /> It is time now for the Minister to set up a working party to examine the feasibility of removing older animals and those most likely to be infected with BSE.</P>
    <P>What is the payback for consumers in this scheme? They have a reasonable expectation of a quality product that is safe, traceable and clearly labelled. They also have, to date, paid a hefty bill for the purchase for destruction scheme. Substantial subsidies are already payable to farmers for rearing cattle. It appears an additional subsidy is payable to have young, healthy cattle slaughtered and incinerated. At the very least, consumers should be entitled to the assurance of the safety and quality of their meat as a result of paying for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The exchange of letters between the Minister and the Food Safety Authority has done nothing to restore confidence in meat. The authority, by admission of the Departments of Health and Children and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has been doing an excellent job in securing a safer food supply for all. However, as I have said many times before, safe food does not begin at the farm gate. It begins with the raw materials used in the production of the final food. The miller who provides the animal feed is as much part of the chain as the processor or retailer of the food. Unless and until we have a seamless operation of inspection and monitoring from raw material to finished product, we will continue to have reason for reservations about the safety of our food.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party called for the separation of food safety from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development the Minister said that as far as food safety is concerned, the Department operates under contract to the Food Safety Authority. However, the Minister's website has listed food safety as one of the responsibilities of his Department.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has played an important role in highlighting the inadequacies in our systems to ensure food safety. The independence of the authority should not be undermined. BSE and foot and mouth disease have highlighted gaps in our traceability systems. Instead of instigating turf wars, the focus should be to ensure accountability for the consumer, who should always come first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of presenting to the House the facts surrounding recent correspondence between the Minister and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in relation to the operation of the purchase for destruction scheme being operated by my Department. I am amazed that Deputy Upton is not herself amazed that meat factories have recently let television cameras inside their premises, and the Deputy should reflect on this fact. The factories have let cameras in as they are opposed to the destruct <Col N="1016" /> scheme and want a better price. It is the first time that cameras have been allowed to operate inside a meat factory in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has an excellent working relationship with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. This relationship is based primarily on the formal execution of the service contracts governing the provision of food safety controls in the various sectors as provided for under the FSAI legislation. Such contracts exist with other Departments and State agencies providing food safety control services. It also embraces a huge range of day to day contact and joint effort by the two organisations with the overall objective of ensuring that consumers are given the maximum possible guarantee relating to the safety of the food products produced in Ireland. My Department has participated in jointly run training courses and seminars for the various teams contributing to the overall provision of food safety services in the State. Apart from informal contact on a regular basis, there is also in place a liaison group at senior officer level, which meets regularly to consider issues as they arise.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the FSAI was in line with the policy of this Government and had among its primary objectives that of ensuring that there was a coherent and seamless provision of food safety throughout the State and that the highest standards were observed. My Department has fully operated within this new arrangement which, on the experience so far, has proven to have been extremely positive from the point of view of the Irish consumer. To continue to call for the separation of food safety from this Department not only ignores the reality of the FSAI but also fails to take account of the role of the Department of Health and Children as the Department responsible for the FSAI.</P>
      <P>The correspondence referred to in the motion dealt with the purchase for destruction scheme. This scheme was put in place by the EU Commission as a response to the market difficulties experienced in cattle and beef in the wake of the most recent BSE crisis within Europe. The specific purpose of the scheme was to remove excess product from the market and thus to maintain incomes of producers at a reasonable level. The measure was not related to food safety but was designed to provide an outlet for beef for which outlets no longer existed. This situation was made clear in the numerous press statements issued by the Minister and was also made abundantly clear in this House. Side by side with this measure, other measures were put in place to restore confidence in beef and to add additional guarantees to those already in place. These included the action taken on meat and bonemeal and the introduction of testing of cattle over 30 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of statements made by the FSAI chief executive on an RTE television programme, which implied that the Department was misleading the public, the Minister wrote to the FSAI chairman to clarify the position and to ask that <Col N="1017" /> the public record be corrected accordingly. To do so would be the least expected of the Minister, whose duty it was to ensure that the FSAI should be fully aware of the facts surrounding a very important and costly measure. The Minister subsequently received assurances that the FSAI chief executive accepted that there had been no deliberate misleading of the public on the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that any room for misunderstanding has been removed and that the FSAI is now aware of the various elements contained in the overall EU response to the recent BSE crisis in Europe. The clarification of facts has not in any way damaged the excellent relationship between the FSAI and my Department, which continues to operate at all levels, nor has it undermined in any way the role of the FSAI. The correspondence dealt with a specific issue and the matter is now closed.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> This was to have been Ireland's best ever season for tourism. Bookings and inquiries were up. Indications from overseas trade fairs were never better. It now looks as if it may be the worst season for many years. While the tourism figures for 2000 are not yet available, provisional estimates show that 6.3 million overseas visitors came to Ireland during that year. Over 3.4 million of these came from Britain. This year, British tourists have to be told they are not wanted. To an industry that earns £4 billion per annum, and which is already reeling following the cancellation of St. Patrick's Day celebrations, the prospects are dire.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Day was to have kick-started the tourist season. Instead of the season kicking in with a bang, we have had empty hotels and guesthouses, tour buses lying idle, deposits returned and airline flights cancelled. Apart from the cancellation of conferences thus far, approximately 500 conferences are now under threat. Rural tourism is particularly hit with virtually all outdoor pursuit centres closed. Angling areas in the west are devastated because of the total ban on angling. The tourism sector has been fully willing to co-operate with the national campaign to keep foot and mouth out. They participated wholeheartedly in the country's determination to stave off a national disaster. However, they now find that they are facing financial disaster. The blanket advice to people not to visit Ireland is misunderstood in certain markets, giving the impression that Ireland has a virulent public health problem and is closed to visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 181,141 persons are employed in the hotel, restaurant, guesthouse and licensed premises sectors. When one factors in self-catering accommodation, fast food outlets and other tourist services and attractions, one is talking about an employment figure of well in excess of 250,000. Already many are being laid off. If this is the situation at an early stage one can anticipate wholesale lay-offs and unemployment in a few weeks <Col N="1018" /> time. One can also anticipate major financial difficulties for enterprises which have borrowed heavily to develop their facilities and have now no income. Many will not survive.</P>
    <P>One coach operator told me that, in anticipation of St. Patrick's Day celebrations and the World Cross Country Championship, he had spent over £1 million on new coaches. Both events were cancelled. His coaches are empty and idle, he has no cash flow and his business is in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>What angers those in the tourism industry is that they have shown solidarity to the national anti-foot and mouth campaign, yet the Government has forgotten their interests. There is no coherent strategy in place, no B-plan. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Government seem to go from day to day hoping that there will be no outbreak here and that the crisis will ease in Britain. Thankfully, there has been no outbreak here. However, what was a brushfire in Britain three weeks ago is now a raging inferno. The number of confirmed cases today is 361 and the figure gets worse daily. Even if the problem begins to scale down the necessary incubation and clearance period means that the British tourist market is a write-off for this year. With 50% of the tourism market written off tourism interests want to know the Government's plans. Will there be a compensation package? Will the Government meet the banks to try to obtain attractive finance terms for tourism businesses that borrowed heavily and are now in crisis because of foot and mouth disease to try to sustain enterprises? Will the Government immediately put in place an economic sub-committee to assess the economic consequences of the crisis and take positive action? Is the Government now prepared to launch a massive marketing campaign to target countries which have not been affected by foot and mouth disease? Will the Government launch a major marketing initiative to encourage as many people as possible to holiday at home this year in the national interest?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I agree with many of the sentiments he expressed.</P>
      <P>I spoke about this subject on the Adjournment on 7 March and I answered a number of parliamentary questions on it recently. The Deputy will be aware that the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation will devote a full day's meeting on Thursday next to hearing the views of 12 tourism groups on the impact of the current foot and mouth crisis on the tourism industry. I will listen carefully to what these groups have to say and I will respond in detail at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said previously, the possibility of foot and mouth disease &ndash; FMD &ndash; spreading to this country threatens our economic security and the livelihoods of not only farmers and the agriculture and food sector, but potentially every citizen. Agri<Col N="1019" /> culture and livestock are of such importance to the whole economy that the Government and the entire population must be thorough in our combined efforts to ensure that the disease does not spread with disastrous consequences. The impact of the current control measures on the tourism industry have given us a glimpse of how much worse matters would be if there was a full-scale outbreak.</P>
    <P>A series of initiatives have already been taken within the tourism and sports sectors to help reduce the danger of a spread of the disease and, on behalf of the Government, I thank all those involved and look forward to their continuing co-operation to overcome the current difficulties. The implications for our tourism industry, which employs more than 150,000 people and is worth over £3 billion annually to the economy, of the foot and mouth disease crisis will depend on the scale and duration of associated restrictions. If there is sustained negative international publicity, travel restrictions and prolonged closure of certain key tourism attractions and facilities here, it will have a very significant impact on the level of business in 2001 and subsequent years, particularly, as Deputy Higgins said, from the British market which has been one of the main engines of tourism growth in recent years.</P>
    <P>On 8 March I met a delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &ndash; ITIC &ndash; which represents all sectors of the industry, to discuss the potentially very serious effects on tourism. I note from a press release issued by the ITIC that it estimates that overseas business could be down by 15% to 20%, amounting to a loss of foreign revenue of £500 million. My Department is represented on the task force which at present convenes daily under the chairmanship of the Mini<Col N="1020" /> ster for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to review measures to prevent the spread of the disease. In addition, a separate high level tourism action group, which is chaired by Bord Fáilte and includes my Department and key ITIC representatives, has been established to monitor the situation on a continual basis and it has met on five occasions to date. The objective is to be in a position to actively manage issues affecting tourism business already booked and limit any medium to long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects overseas.</P>
    <P>The industry is most immediately concerned about the temporary closure of some of our flagship State cultural and heritage attractions, the cancellation of many local events activities within the country and, as the Deputy pointed out, the advice to visitors from the UK not to travel to Ireland unless absolutely necessary. I brought these key concerns of the tourism industry to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who, following a report to him by an expert group, announced on Friday last the easing of certain foot and mouth disease controls.</P>
    <P>The guidelines issued by the expert group will enable a significant number of low risk events and activities in the tourism and sports areas to recommence immediately as long as everyone in tourism and sporting circles continues to take the necessary precautionary measures. I welcome the view of the Minister, Deputy Walsh that, subject to necessary precautions, urban-based business from Britain need not be discouraged. I look forward to discussing the matter further with the Deputy and the interests involved at the meeting on Thursday.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 March 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation to provide for the appointment of an ombudsman for the newspaper industry. In recommending the establishment of an ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards, the Commission on the Newspaper Industry was clear that the ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry. I agree with that recommendation.</P>
      <P>I understand that, while some preparatory work has been carried out by the newspaper industry, the recommendation on the establishment of an ombudsman has not yet been implemented. The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation and in that respect I understand from my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to provide any estimate of the costs of establishing and operating the proposed ombudsman. That is a matter for the newspaper industry itself.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt the newspaper industry's commitment to implementing the ombudsman recommendation, albeit linked to reform of the law on defamation, and, accordingly, I have no proposals in relation to its failing to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the overall position of women in the labour market, the participation rate has increased significantly from 39.5% in 1995 to 47.9% at present. There were 700,000 women in employment at the end of 2000 compared to 550,000 five years ago.</P>
      <P>The thrust of national policies to assist the increased female participation in the labour market is set out in the Employment Action Plan 2000. In summary Government policies are based on: reform of taxation to increase the reward for work; provision of suitable child care facilities; promotion of a family-friendly workplace; and provision of appropriate education and training.</P>
      <P>It is through these policies that equal opportunities for women and men to participate in the labour market will be achieved. The national development plan envisages spending of the order of 120 million in the Border-midlands-west region on equal opportunities measures over the period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department's immediate responsibilities are concerned, FÁS plays a key role in the delivery of training measures generally, and in respect of specific courses to assist, for example, women returning to the labour market. Outside of apprenticeship training, almost half of FÁS training places are occupied by females. Programmes are administered on the basis of the needs of individual regions with the application of resources in particular areas of the country being a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>
      <P>In terms of jobs being created and the gender breakdown, industrial development in particular areas is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
      <P>However, the Government through its enterprise support agencies is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities both in terms of gender and geographically. IDA Ireland's current strategy to encourage a greater proportion of new overseas investment to locate outside the larger urban areas is gaining momentum and showing results in terms of the calibre of overseas companies currently looking at alternative locations within Ireland. This is being achieved by focusing on the main population centres in each region. In this connection, IDA Ireland is reorganising its internal structures and plans to place greater resources in Athlone from 1 September to achieve maximum impact at regional level.</P>

      <P>My Department facilitates the integration of non-nationals into the work-force by ensuring that such persons are aware of opportunities in Ireland and by issuing work permits, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The integration of non-nationals into the work-force is the responsibility of Irish employers who must ensure that non-nationals recruited by them, or on their behalf, have the necessary linguistic and other skills to contribute fully to the work of their enterprises. The majority of non-nationals coming to Ireland in recent years have come from other EU member states, but an increasing number have been coming from elsewhere in the world.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, employers and employment agencies here are developing programmes to assist non-nationals in adjusting to Irish conditions and work practices, particularly where cultural differences are such as may give rise to difficulties.</P>
      <P>To the extent that employers find that people are being recruited to work in Ireland in the absence of a proper appreciation of conditions here, they should demand a more rigorous approach from those doing the recruiting and preparation. An area of particular concern is that of basic language skills. My Department is at present finalising translations of a statement of basic rights of employees which will be available in a number of relevant languages.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any overt barriers to social integration which is clearly a gradual process and I am sure that most Irish people will extend a warm welcome to new co-workers and neighbours.

    <P>During 2000 there were approximately 44,000 job gains in agency assisted firms, which offset the job losses in similar firms of approximately 20,800 giving a net gain of approximately 23,200 during the year. Indeed, the figure for job gains was the highest achieved in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Analysis of the job losses shows that they reflect the gradual re-orientation of industry towards higher value added sectors and restructuring in the indigenous and foreign owned industrial base in response to intense competition in both domestic and export markets. A certain level of &ldquo;job churn&rdquo; is always to be expected in the economy and is not necessarily a bad thing, particularly if it leads to a shift in employment into higher productivity sectors thereby maintaining competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is the main agency responsible for the development of Irish industry, and is the principal agency dealing with the traditional industry sectors. A key focus of their interaction with clients across all sectors is to address competitiveness issues in order to improve productivity. In particular, Enterprise Ireland's business development model looks at production and operations related issues and the capability of companies in this regard.</P>
    <P>Lower cost economies in Eastern Europe and Asia have a labour cost advantage over Ireland and other European economies in the manufacture of clothing. As a result, many companies have moved away from being traditional sub-contractors, into a more sustainable branded position. With the support of the development agencies, the emphasis of their business is moving away from being largely production led, to a more design, marketing and logistics led business.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to addressing job losses and general economic needs through a process of balanced regional development. The challenge of achieving balanced regional development is a multi-faceted one which is addressed in many aspects of the national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006. In so far as my own Department is concerned, the main emphasis is in relation to industrial development.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with this, a focus on regional development is being implemented by the industrial development agencies. IDA Ireland has intensified its efforts to achieve a better distribution of overseas investment into the regions. Overall, 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during 2000 in new green field investment projects were secured for the Border, midland and western regions, which is ahead of the agency's expectations for the year. Enterprise Ireland <Col N="1025" /> has also developed a comprehensive approach to achieving balanced regional development.</P>

      <P>The day-to-day resolution of industrial disputes is primarily a matter for the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. I am concerned at the level of industrial action taking place or threatened. We have in place procedures and institutions to support dispute resolution and it is incumbent on employers and employees to work within those procedures and institutions.</P>
      <P>The policy of my Department has been to promote the voluntarist approach whereby parties made the maximum effort to resolve disputes in direct talks. Where these talks fail there are, in the vast majority of employment, agreed disputes procedures normally involving the LRC and the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>More than four fifths of cases dealt with by the LRC are settled at conciliation. Issues which are not resolved through the use of the LRC's Conciliation Service are normally referred to the Labour Court for investigation. The Labour Court is held in high regard by both workers and employees and the great majority of its recommendations are accepted by the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the parties of the industrial peace clause and procedures they agreed as part of the PPF, and the further strengthening of these <Col N="1026" /> procedures which were agreed last December.

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 42, 100 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>To support and facilitate family friendly policies in the workplace, the National Framework Committee for the Development of Family Friendly Policies at the Level of the Enterprise, was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The committee comprises representatives of ICTU, IBEC, public sector employers, the Equality Authority, a number of Departments, and is chaired by my Department.</P>
      <P>The national framework committee has already undertaken a number of initiatives to raise awareness and provide information. The first Family Friendly Workplace Day, supported by ICTU, IBEC and the Equality Authority, was held on 1 March. My colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, launched a new interactive web site, www.familyfriendly.ie, and an information brochure entitled &ldquo;An Introduction to Family Friendly Working Arrangements&rdquo; on behalf of the National Framework Committee to coincide with Family Friendly Workplace Day.</P>
      <P>As part of the information and awareness campaign being undertaken by the committee, a series of follow-on actions are planned. There is a programme of four regional seminars scheduled from April to June, in Dundalk, Galway, Waterford and Cork. It is hoped that Family Friendly Workplace Day, and the regional seminars will be the springboard for a range of new initiatives at enterprise level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of family friendly policies is best addressed on two fronts. First, through the work of the National Framework Committee, allied to a partnership approach in the workplace <Col N="1027" /> between employers, employees and trades unions. Second, through appropriate legislative measures. There are of course various family friendly statutory entitlements including maternity leave, adoptive leave and parental leave. I am currently piloting two important Bills through the Oireachtas, the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 and the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000. In addition, my colleague, Deputy John O'Donoghue, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has announced a review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998 </P>
    <P>The Government is committed to this approach in order to achieve the goal of making workplaces family friendly. The work of the National Framework Committee has got off to a good start and, with the support of the social partners and the Equality Authority, I am confident that further progress will be achieved.</P>

      <Quest>the steps which are being taken to ensure that Irish employers comply with the recent decision of the European Court of Justice that if employers require their workers to work overtime it must be made clear in the contract of employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7116/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the position under Irish employment law, and contract law generally, that an employer may not introduce a new term into, or alter a term of the contract of a employment without the consent of the employee concerned. The recent decision of the European Court of Justice, simply affirms the historic Irish position. Accordingly, I am satisfied that Irish employment rights legislation fully complies with the European Court of Justice ruling.</P>
      <P>All terms and conditions of employment in excess of statutory entitlements are determined by a legally enforceable agreement between the employer and the employee whether directly, or indirectly by representatives of employers/ employees. Any term of an employment contract which relates to overtime, or work beyond normal hours, is subject to agreement by the parties to the contract. An employee, like any party to a contract, has the right to institute and pursue proceedings in the courts in respect of his or her contractual rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if a dispute arises in relation to overtime, it is open to the parties to settle it between themselves, or avail of the State's industrial relations dispute resolution machinery, provided for under the Industrial Relations Acts. In the event of a failure to resolve the issue between the parties at this juncture, the issue may be referred <Col N="1028" /> to the Labour Relations Commission for investigation under the Industrial Relations Acts. In addition, if an employer to whom the Organisation of Working Time Act applies, insists on the employee working more than the maximum average 48 hours per week provided for under the Organisation of Working Time Act, the employee may refer the matter to the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission for redress under that Act.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the above general rights under contract law, and the industrial relations facilities for the resolution of disputes in relation to the employment contract, section 3(1)(i) of the Terms of Employment Act, 1994 imposes an obligation on employers to give to their employees a statement in writing containing certain categories of agreed terms, including any terms or conditions relating to hours of work, including overtime. This statement must be given within two months of commencement of employment to those employees who commenced employment since 16 May 1994, when the Act came into operation, and within two months of requesting their terms for those employees in employment prior to that date. An employee may pursue his or her axiomatic right by way of complaint to a rights commissioner, and appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The District Court has jurisdiction to make enforcement orders in respect of a determination of the tribunal in this regard. The 1994 Act does not apply to a person who is normally required to work for an employer for less than eight hours a week or who has been in the continuous service of the employer for less than one month.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 provides that prior notice of at least 24 hours before the first day in which additional hours are to be worked must be given by the employer to the employee of any additional hours which the employer requires the employee to work in any week and which the employer may from time to time decide in accordance with the contract of employment. This right may be pursued on complaint to a rights commissioner and appeal to the Labour Court. The Circuit Court has jurisdiction to make an order enforcing the determination of the Labour Court in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Special Working Group on a Personal Injuries Tribunal, chaired by Mr. Dan McAuley, published its first report in May 1997. In that report the special working group set out two alternative structures for a mediation board for occupational injury claims &ndash; the first to operate within the courts system, and the second, an alternative mediation structure, to be established on a green field basis, outside the ambit of the courts system and operating, initially, on a two-year pilot basis.</P>
      <P>A majority of the working group, had reservations about the cost effectiveness of a green field mediation board. The group instead recommended a mediation system to be established within the courts system, having regard to assurances given to it about the rapid pace and scale of the on-going reform of court procedures and elimination of delays.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the special working group's second report, which I received in April last, proposals have now been put before Government with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation, by streamlining the claims process. The second report of the special working group is expected to be published when the Cabinet decision on this matter comes to hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Balanced regional development is a cornerstone of the strategies being pursued by this Government. A co-ordinated approach to regional development, based on driving growth in regional enterprise, has been adopted across the board by my Department, the Department of Education and Science, the regional assemblies, and the industrial development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>The designation of the country into two regions, Border, midland and west &ndash; BMW &ndash; and southern and eastern &ndash; S&amp;E &ndash; aims to achieve more balanced development by increasing the presence in each region of the key drivers of sustainable economic growth. The third level sector is viewed as a vital component of the innovation system in each region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operational programme for each region contains a sub-measure on regional innovation strategies, which is intended to strengthen the regional innovation infrastructure by facilitating the provision of incubation and commercial research and development space for the development and establishment of high potential businesses. Funds will be made available under this measure, which was launched in February 2001, to the institutes of technology to develop and <Col N="1031" /> expand incubation space and commercial research and development facilities.</P>
    <P>The research technological development and innovation &ndash; RTDI &ndash; measures under the national development plan also makes provision for a number of complimentary measures which harness the regional technological infrastructure to enable existing firms to grow and to influence the rate at which firms are set up, including regionally led studies and innovation networks. The process of rolling out the programmes to give effect to these initiatives is currently under way.</P>
    <P>In addition to these specific measures geared directly towards the needs of the regions, I am co-operating closely with the Minister for Education and Science to strengthen linkages between the business and third level sectors, and a range of schemes are in operation to address this issue. Both my Department and the Department of Education and Science through their respective programmes for research under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, are seeking to put in place the supports necessary to maintain Ireland's position at the cutting edge of research and technology. My Department administers a number of measures promoting collaboration between industry and the third level sector. These are also part of the £1.2 billion allocation for industrial research, technological development and innovation under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In order to provide increased scope for greater collaboration between the third level sector and industry it is necessary to improve the research skills and capacity of all third level institutions. The Department of Education and Science is tackling this through a £550 million investment in research, technological development and innovation in the third level sector over the course of the national development plan. The programme is aimed at supporting the development of a world class research environment in higher education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the combination of all of these measures will provide the necessary linkages and collaboration between the third level sector and industry at regional level so as to stimulate economic growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 48 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of allegations of certain employment agencies being involved in the abuse of immigrant workers' employment rights, the Labour Inspectorate in my Department has been and continues to be engaged in a range of ongoing investigations, including alleged abuses affecting foreign nursing and hotel sector staff. In the course of its current activities the inspectorate has completed 88 investigations under the terms of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, and it is anticipated that work in this area will continue for several more weeks. Where breaches of the legislation are established, prosecution will follow. However, it would not be appropriate for me, at this time to make any statement which might prejudice the outcome of these investigations. The current restrictions arising from the measures implemented to deal with the foot and mouth crisis are likely to impact on the scope of these activities.</P>
      <P>Employment agency activity is monitored and regulated by means of a licensing scheme. Under the terms of the Employment Agency Act, 1971 a person shall not carry on the business of an employment agency except under, and in accordance with, a licence under that Act. In order to qualify for a licence an applicant must satisfy my Department as to compliance with certain conditions. These conditions are designed, in the main, to ensure that only persons who are of good character and who carry on employment agency business from premises which are suitable for that purpose are granted licences. In assessing applications, my Department operates a policy of strict adherence to all of the licensing criteria. In particular, the 1971 Act permits employment agencies to charge placement fees to the employers for whom they source foreign workers but it precludes them from charging such fees to the individual workers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of alleged exploitation of foreign nurses and hotel staff, the position is that Irish labour law makes no distinction between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers and, as such, immigrant workers are entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections as their Irish colleagues. However, abuses of such statutory employment rights and protections have been reported. These abuses typically involve the reneging on the pay terms and other working conditions offered to the immigrant worker before departure from his or her home country. When placed in employment here in Ireland they may then be subjected to excessive working hours, illegal deductions, that is, excessive accommodation fees, non-payment of over<Col N="1033" /> time or Sunday or holiday-public holiday pay, etc. Apart from these possible breaches of Irish employment rights legislation, there are issues of contract law at play in these deliberations, together with problems as to jurisdiction. In this regard there are some indications that recruitment fees are being sought at the point of origin.</P>
    <P>While investigations continue into alleged abuses of immigrant workers employment rights, my Department is actively pursuing a number of specific initiatives as follows: (a) possibilities for administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries are being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of foreign workers in Ireland; (b) a fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, is under way to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to modern practices in the employment agency business; (c) changes have been approved in the administrative procedures for the issue of work permits so as to better protect the employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned; (d) the Labour Inspectorate business plan for the current year has as a key task a specific and targeted enforcement campaign in employment hiring foreign workers as well as sectors where such workers are employed; (e) the Labour Inspectorate is currently engaged in a systematic investigation of recent reports alleging abuses affecting foreign nursing and hotel-catering sector staff, and relevant employers and employment agencies are being followed in this process with a view to prosecutions; and (f) it is intended that, as soon as is practicable, work permits will be accompanied by an explanatory document setting out the essential elements of Irish employment rights legislation and protections for workers. This material will be presented in various languages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 49, 66, 76 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>Five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Co. Limited, and Kentford Securities Limited. The examinations of Celtic Helicopters Limited and Kentford Securities Limited are well advanced, and I expect to receive final reports on these companies in the coming months. The remaining examinations will take additional time, and I do not yet have a precise forecast of their likely completion dates.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, the High Court last July quashed my decision to examine the books and documents of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited. An appeal has been lodged on my behalf with the Supreme Court and will be heard on 2 July, 2001.</P>
      <P>Three High Court inquiries are also being undertaken into Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, National Irish Bank Limited &ndash; NIB &ndash; and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited. The two NIB-related inquiries are anticipated to conclude in a few months.</P>
      <P>On 12 March last, the inspectors to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited were granted an order by the High Court which gives them leave to serve a notice of motion out of the jurisdiction upon Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. The motion, which has a return date of 30 April, seeks an order compelling Ansbacher to deliver certain documents to the inspectors pursuant to a requirement made under section 10(6) of the Companies Act, 1990. The application is part of the inspectors' ongoing investigation and arises because the company failed to authorise any person resident in the State to accept proceedings on its behalf.</P>
      <P>At a private hearing before the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands on 9 April next, Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited is scheduled to seek permission to release certain documents to the inspectors to assist their inquiry. It is unclear at this stage what the response of the court will be to this request. Regardless of the outcome, it is hoped that the Ansbacher inquiry can be completed this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of six investigations have been completed to date. These related to National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited under section 59 <Col N="1035" /> of the Insurance Act, 1989, Bula Resources (Holdings) plc under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Faxhill Homes Limited, Garuda Limited &ndash; trading as Streamline Enterprises and IIB Bank Limited &ndash; the latter four under section 19 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>The reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, Garuda Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration. I am not aware of any prosecutions having yet been initiated by the DPP on foot of these reports.</P>
    <P>The report into Faxhill Homes Limited was also initially referred to the DPP but was subsequently returned to my Department. A total of 29 summonses have since been issued on behalf of my Department against Faxhill Homes Limited and its directors in respect of various suspected breaches of the Companies Acts. The defendants have pleaded guilty to three offences under section 91 &ndash; register of debenture holders &ndash; of the Companies Act, 1963. The case will resume in Naas District Court on 21 May next.</P>
    <P>My Department is considering recent legal advice regarding the possible initiation of summary prosecutions for suspected breaches of the Companies Acts identified in the Bula report. I will make a decision on this matter shortly. Enforcement action will also be considered in other appropriate cases in due course.</P>

      <P>The Drinks Prices Order was only one element of an overall package of measures approved by the Government last June to address the inflationary pressures on the economy. When announcing the anti-inflationary package, the Government made it clear that it was only pending the impact of a significant increase in competition in the licensed trade that the circumstances justified the imposition of temporary price controls. The statutory control on the price of drink was clearly understood to be an interim measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that many publicans have acted in a reasonable manner following the expiry of the drinks order. It is also clear that some publicans took the opportunity of the lifting of the order to impose excessive price increases. The indications are that the proportion of pubs increasing their prices and the level of increases being imposed are higher in Dublin that the rest of the country. I firmly believe that competition provides the most effective means of keeping <Col N="1036" /> prices down. These factors are being examined carefully in consideration of whether or not a new drinks prices order should be introduced.</P>

      <P>The objectives and strategies outlined in the national development plan, which relate to my Department, were drawn up in close consultation with Departments and the implementing agencies, which include Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and FÁS.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the Departments and agencies have been set ambitious targets, in particular in relation to the development of the Objective One &ndash; BMW &ndash; Region. For example, under the Productive Sector Operational Programme, IDA Ireland have a target to locate 50% of all new green field jobs in that region.</P>
      <P>The operational programmes under the NDP are monitored by their respective monitoring committees. My Department chairs both the monitoring committees for the productive sector OP and the employment and human resources development OP.</P>
      <P>The first annual reports on the operational programmes will cover the year 2000. These reports are being compiled at present and are due to be considered by the monitoring committees in April-May. While my Department has not yet to hand the full returns for the last year, I am confident that over the period of the plan, the targets for both operational programmes are realistic and achievable. Both programmes will be subject to ongoing independent evaluation to ensure they remain focused and on target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers, whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The National Roads Authority Road Accident Facts Report for 1999, showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies, in the matter of premium levels, or in respect of the risks that they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear, therefore, that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of insurance for motorists, including young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the subsequent claims.</P>
      <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board.</P>
      <P>Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of that group's second report, proposals are now being brought to Government with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation by streamlining the claims process. It is also intended to publish the group's report at that stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance in its Stability Programme, published on budget day in December 2000, predicted a further tightening of the labour <Col N="1038" /> market, with forecast employment growth of 3.5%, 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively, in the years 2001 to 2003, equivalent to an additional 60,000 persons at work in 2001, 37,000 in 2002 and 33,000 in 2003, average annual growth of 2.25% in the labour force over the next three years and a further fall in the unemployment rate to 3.2% in the years 2001 to 2003.</P>
    <P>The Government has in place a comprehensive strategy to meet the labour market challenges faced by a growing economy. Key elements in the overall policy mix include: fiscal measures aimed at enhancing the attractiveness to take-up a job and remain in work; active labour market programmes to assist those currently unemployed and the disadvantaged in their transition to employment; enhanced placement of job seekers; full implementation of the preventive strategy which comprises early and systematic engagement with unemployed, as notified under the Employment Action Plan; measures aimed at upgrading the skills of those at work and unemployed; and enhanced child care.</P>
    <P>The range and scale of our interventions will continue to facilitate enhanced labour force growth and especially encourage increased participation of females in the labour market. This strategic approach aimed at mobilising fully domestic labour supply is being augmented with measures aimed at attracting immigrants to our growing economy. Net outward migration of the early 1990s has been replaced with net inflows, of the order of 20,000 per annum over the last three years of whom approximately 80% are from EU member states or returned Irish emigrants. More than 18,000 work permits were issued last year to non-EEA nationals. In addition, the implementation in April 2000 of the new working visa or authorisation system of which 1,387 were granted up to the end of December 2000, combined with substantial initiatives being implemented by FÁS, including Jobs Ireland, all represent important measures aimed at tapping into additional sources of labour supply.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the Government currently has a comprehensive strategy in place with a full policy mix which will maximise labour supply consistent with the demands of a growing economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilitation, promotion and expansion of trade and business co-operation for indigenous enterprises North and South on an all-island basis are core functions <Col N="1039" /> of one of the Implementation Bodies, that is, the Trade and Business Development Body, now formally known as InterTradeIreland &ndash; ITI &ndash; established under the Good Friday Agreement. Responsibility at ministerial level for ITI is shared by the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in the North and me.</P>
      <P>In implementing these functions ITI focuses its efforts on activities that seek to develop capability and competitiveness in the two economies on the island of Ireland and in the businesses, particularly those in the indigenous sector that drive those economies. Such activities are formulated taking account of the specific tasks assigned on a North-South basis to ITI under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>Specific projects or actions undertaken to date or currently in progress by ITI include the following: the organisation of a highly successful road-show last year in Dublin, Belfast, Limerick and Derry highlighting the importance of market information and networking between enterprises North and South; the organisation of an agency forum which brought together, for the first time last year, the key economic development agencies, North and South, to liaise on core strategic issues; on-going research, in conjunction with other agencies, funding organisations, third level institutions, etc., to maximise the level and quality of cross-Border trade and to identify ways of overcoming obstacles to such trade; the on-going development of an all-island sub-supply and public procurement strategy aimed at linking indigenous suppliers North and South with multi-national and public sector companies; the preparation of proposals for the development of a North-South equity investment programme; the formulation of two graduate placement schemes in regard to trade-market development and business-innovation development which will be activated at an early date; the development of an e-commerce strategy to promote connectivity and usage among SMEs North and South; on-going research on the potential for co-operation North and South between SMEs and higher education institutions; on-going steps to ensure a major and co-ordinated approach island-wide to innovation in SMEs through strategy development and pilot initiatives; and the on-going development, in conjunction with IBEC-CBI, of a report and recommendations on transport and logistics island-wide.</P>
      <P>Very shortly ITI will publish a research document entitled &ldquo;Ireland &ndash; A £20 Billion Retail Market&rdquo; which, in effect, will be a compendium of eight sectoral reports which it produced last year. In addition, ITI is ever active in promoting and facilitating joint meetings between trade and business associations North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 2001 ITI will conduct studies on issues that might improve the business environment for, and the general competitiveness of, enterprises North and South in the areas of skills availability, IT, e-commerce and telecommunications. Recommendations emerging from these studies <Col N="1040" /> will be assessed by the NSMC. My Department, moreover, will maintain contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in the North with respect to possible further work on competitiveness-related issues that might be undertaken collaboratively between us.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland also has a strong focus in their operations on the promotion of North-South business opportunities for the indigenous sector. In this connection they engage in active co-operation with ITI and with a range of other agencies North and South. Their programmes and strategies are designed to achieve linkages between the research and development communities on both sides of the Border, to identify new trade opportunities in the North for their client companies, and to encourage Dublin-based companies with expansion proposals to locate new projects in Border counties.</P>

      <P>It is possible to purchase compact discs from a wide variety of retail outlets from specialist music shops and department stores to garage shops and supermarkets. It is also becoming much easier, in particular with the advent of e-commerce, for Irish consumers to purchase such products directly from outlets in other countries. I welcome the fact that there is a large variation in the prices for compact discs and I would strongly encourage consumers to take full advantage of the competition that exists in the market for these products by shopping around for the best value.</P>

      <P>The Dunmanway <Col N="1041" /> Inter Agency Task Force was established in response to the announced closure of the facility with effect from 11 February 2000 with the loss of 113 jobs. The task force is chaired by IDA Ireland and comprises representatives from Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, the county enterprise board and the county manager for west Cork. The main focus for the task force is on attracting a replacement industry and providing assistance to employees, such as advice on alternative career opportunities and training and retraining courses.</P>
      <P>The factory was purchased by O'Flynn Construction on 31 August 2000. This company has developed major office parks such as the University Technology Park in Cork and the Eastgate Business Park at Little Island. IDA Ireland has collaborated with O'Flynn Construction to produce a colour brochure to advertise the factory. O'Flynn Construction has also taken out a half page advertisement in the national newspapers to promote the factory. IDA Ireland has supplied lists of companies which they consider may be interested in the factory, including contacts in IDA Ireland overseas offices world-wide, and contacts within IDA's Ireland's operating divisions. Copies of the new brochure have been made available to the Dunmanway Employment Initiative Group.</P>
      <P>A small number of visits has been generated but, so far, there has been no positive interest in the factory. However, vigorous efforts are continuing to be made to secure a tenant.</P>
      <P>One of the major difficulties in promoting the factory is that the skill set of the former work-force is mainly related to the textile industry &ndash; cutting and sewing operations, and 80% of new employment opportunities arising in the south-west region come from three sources &ndash; pharmaceuticals and health care international service operations and electronics. Textile skills have been in decline throughout the nation, except for niche markets.</P>
      <P>In February 2000, FÁS staff attended the factory to register 103 employees who indicated an interest in FÁS courses or employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>On 21-22 March 2000, FÁS attended Dunmanway to register participants for a return to work-ECDL course. This course ran from 10 April to 14 July, with 24 participants. On completion of the course, 11 participants were placed in employment. Others expressed an interest in further training. However, there has been a poor response to the FÁS follow-up survey from these participants.</P>
      <P>On 4-5 September, 2000, FÁS attended Dunmanway to register participants for a second return to work-ECDL course. This course did not generate the same enthusiasm and FÁS was unable to fill this course. The course commenced on 25 October 2000 and finished in January 2001, with 22 participants. Two of the participants were from the former plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-agency group had a meeting on 16 February 2001, and it was decided that FÁS <Col N="1042" /> would carry-out a postal survey of the former employees in March to determine the numbers who had obtained employment and those interested in further training opportunities.</P>
    <P>An examination of the unemployment register in Dunmanway has revealed that 236 persons were unemployed as at January 2001, as opposed to 267 persons for the corresponding period in January 2000, a fall of 11.6% in unemployment. The unemployment register of 236 persons consisted of 98 males and 138 females.</P>
    <P>Both IDA Ireland and FÁS maintain on-going contact with the Dunmanway Employment Initiative. IDA Ireland continues to promote Dunmanway for potential overseas investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the national authority for occupational safety and health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by the Health and Safety Authority and is therefore obtainable directly from the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I have been informed by the authority that there were 23 construction-related fatalities in 2000, while two fatal accidents have been reported to the authority this year to date. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to the Health and Safety Authority to date, for 2000, is 989.</P>
    <P>The management of health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and awareness-raising coupled with a partnership approach. There is a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed and this legislation is enforced in a pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority. The additional resources, both financial and staffing, which I have secured for the authority, are being put to good effect in the construction sector through targeted inspection, enforcement and awareness-raising activities.</P>
    <P>However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in the construction sector, a strong partnership approach &ndash; by all the parties at all levels in the sector &ndash; to the issue of safety must be adopted. This partnership approach was further developed and strengthened in 2000 in the context of the Construction Safety Partnership &ndash; CSP &ndash; which includes representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU.</P>
    <P>The report of the CSP sets out a detailed three-year partnership plan to improve occupational safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry, and the parties to the plan have made a number of wide-ranging commitments which they have undertaken to implement over that period of time.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the partnership plan cover measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training, introduction of safety management systems and increased inspection activity by the Health and Safety Authority. Work will continue throughout this year on implementing the recommendations of the plan and it is proposed to publish a report recording progress over the first year by the end of the first quarter of 2001.</P>

      <P>The jobs initiative programme is an active labour market programme for persons unemployed for five years or longer and over 35 years of age. The programme was introduced as a pilot in 1996-97 with 1,000 places available on phase 1. The level of available places on the programme has remained constant since 1999 at 2,875 and will remain at this level for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>A small number of the phase 1 participants still remain on the programme. It is intended that certain of these participants will avail of the new high supports process being developed by my Department in consultation with the social partners.

      <P>Other phase 1 job initiative participants who have completed their personal development plans and are ready to progress to open labour market employment are being offered further support by FÁS in the form of participation in jobs clubs to assist them in identifying suitable job opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 99 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of a gap in economic performance between Dublin and other major cities in <Col N="1050" /> the rest of the country, I feel that Cork, Limerick and Galway can, in common with Dublin, be regarded as successful from the point of view of industrial and economic development. Waterford is an exception to this as far as attracting new investment is concerned, and IDA Ireland is to target Waterford as a priority for new investment.</P>
    <P>The challenge of achieving balanced regional development is a multifaceted one which is addressed in many aspects of the national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006. These policies, which have a particular focus on infrastructure development, human resource development and the stimulation of productive investment by the private sector, are being implemented across a range of Departments. Expenditure under the plan is significantly biased on a <i>per capita </i>basis in favour of the Border, midland and western regions.</P>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the main emphasis in securing balanced regional development is in relation to industrial development.</P>
    <P>The maximum grant aid rates payable by the industrial development agencies in respect of new industrial investment are becoming increasingly differentiated on a regional basis, under the regional aid rates approved by the EU Commission for the period 2000 to 2006. Under this regime, the maximum aid rate for firms in the Border, midland and western regions is 40% for large firms with an additional 15% for SMEs. The maximum aid rate in Dublin is 17.5% for large firms with an additional 10% for SMEs. The rest of the country is currently in transition from rates which were close to the BMW rates in 2000 to rates of 18% to 20% for large firms with an additional 10% for SMEs by 2004. </P>
    <P>The regional differentiation reflects the relative positions of the regions in terms of economic development. In conjunction with it, a focus on regional development is being implemented by the industrial development agencies. IDA Ireland has intensified its efforts to achieve a better distribution of overseas investment into the regions. Overall, 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during 2000 in new green field investment projects have been secured for the Border, midland and western region, which is ahead of IDA Ireland expectations for the year. Enterprise Ireland has also developed a comprehensive approach to achieving balanced regional development. It is on four distinct pillars, developing existing business, building the environment for business, encouraging new high potential start-ups, and exploiting new opportunities &ndash; which involves facilitating the expansion of Dublin-based companies to regional locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety. It sets out the responsibilities of both employers and employees in relation to providing a safe working environment. The Act applies to all places of work and to all employers, employees and the self-employed. The Health and Safety Authority was established under the 1989 Act and is responsible for the enforcement of workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>However, while the introduction of the Act, and the establishment of the authority in 1989 put workplace health and safety firmly on the business agenda, I asked the authority to undertake a comprehensive review of the 1989 Act, particularly in the context of the social and economic changes which have taken place since its introduction. As the Deputy will be aware the commitment to review the Act is also underpinned in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The in-depth review is being carried out by a sub-committee of the board of the authority. I have been informed by the authority that the review is now nearing completion and I look forward to receiving the outcome and findings of the review in the immediate future. This will enable my officials and I to develop legislative proposals to amend, strengthen and update our statutory health and safety provisions, where deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>While I anticipate that the areas of offences and penalties will, amongst other areas, have been fully examined in the context of the above review, it would be premature at this stage to speculate on what specific legislative proposals will be developed.</P>

Retraining, where appropriate, is being provided to enhance employment prospects for the workers affected and every effort is being made to assist them to secure employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a number of cases involving young people who have been charged car insurance premiums in the region of the amount mentioned.</P>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers, whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The National Roads Authority Road Accident Facts Report for 1999, showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured, on Irish roads, were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks that they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear therefore that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of insurance for motorists, including young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the subsequent claims.</P>
      <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board.</P>
      <P>Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of that group's second report, proposals are now being brought to Government with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation by streamlining the claims process. It is also intended to publish the group's report at that stage.</P>

      <P>I anticipate that the task force report, including the findings of the comprehensive national survey on workplace bullying, which was commissioned by the task force and undertaken by the ESRI, will be particularly useful in helping to inform future strategies and policies for dealing with workplace bullying at both State level, and at the level of individual enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The package of taxation and company law measures introduced in 1999 and 2000 to address problems arising from the use of Irish registered non-resident companies &ndash; IRNRs &ndash; for undesirable purposes, provide that all companies have to be linked more closely to the State and interface more fully with the Revenue Commissioners and the Registrar of Companies, in compliance with a range of new requirements in company and taxation law.</P>
      <P>The key change is in the taxation area as a result of which all companies registered under the Companies Acts are now regarded as being resident in the State for tax purposes, except for companies meeting specific criteria specified in the Finance Act, 1999. The effect of this is that the IRNR structure is no longer generally available. Going forward, therefore, only companies meeting Revenue's criteria can qualify for the IRNR status under the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
      <P>In relation to the position of companies in existence prior to the coming into operation of the new measures Revenue have written to approximately 80,000. These are companies which are incorporated in the State but which had not made contact with Revenue for the purposes of registering for tax as required under the new taxation provisions.</P>
      <P>Approximately 33,000 of these companies have been struck off the Companies Office register, either voluntarily or on foot of that office's procedures. Close on 1,100 companies have been struck off the register following notification, under the 1999 Finance Act provisions, to the Registrar by Revenue that the companies had failed to furnish Revenue with the required information. A further list of such companies to be notified to the Registrar with a view to striking them off is close to being finalised by Revenue.</P>
      <P>Approximately 13,000 companies have registered for tax while 3,000 have given the required information to Revenue but have indicated that they have not commenced trading. The position of the remaining companies remains under consideration by Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> There is no information available in the Companies Office on the number of IRNRs. Essentially, an IRNR is a company which is incorporated in Ireland under Irish company law but which is not deemed to be resident here for tax purposes because it qualifies for the exceptions provided in the 1999 Finance Act. Consequently, Revenue alone determines which companies incorporated under the Companies Acts qualifies for IRNR status under the 1999 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>In 2000, 41,217 companies in total were struck off the Registrar in comparison to 37,850 companies struck off in 1999.</P>
    <P>While I have seen newspaper reports some weeks ago in relation to alleged illegal activity by IRNRs, my Department has no direct involvement in any of these cases. It was the potential damage, which such activity had that prompted the Government to take the measures that I have already described and which have so far borne the results outlined.</P>
    <P>The current legislative measures will continue to be effectively enforced through the ongoing co-operative efforts on the part of Revenue and the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, when established, to ensure that the IRNR problem is eliminated over time.</P>

      <P>I understand that direct selling by telephone of motor insurance cover has become a feature in recent years and that payment by direct debit has become more common. This is often a convenient method of payment for the policyholder. For many young motorists, in particular, a periodic payment method may be the only affordable means of obtaining insurance cover. Many motorists who accept a quotation over the phone and enter into a direct debit agreement, may later experience difficulties in meeting payment instalments.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1058" /> Insurance cover is only granted by insurance companies, subject to the applicant complying with certain criteria such as verification of his/her personal details, status of no claims bonus or claims record. In the event that the client fails to produce documentary verification within a set period or more commonly, where the client fails to maintain periodic payments, the insurer may withdraw cover. In such circumstances, the insurer is required to issue a seven day cancellation letter, in order to comply with the road traffic legislation. I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Garda are notified of the details of each cancellation. In all cases where cancellation clauses are effected by insurance companies the return of the insurance certificate and insurance disc are requested by the companies and the policyholder is informed that this is a legal requirement.</P>

      <P>Forfás has managed the EMU business awareness campaign since 1996 on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The latest survey undertaken by the ESRI on behalf of the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign on the levels of preparations by businesses shows that many small businesses have not yet made adequate preparations for the changeover.</P>
      <P>The campaign held a national conference on the euro in Loughrea, County Galway, on 19 February 2001 which highlighted the changeover experiences of the SME firms involved in the Loughrea euro town project as they switched to euro-based trading. The Loughrea project has identified many practical issues for SMEs in preparing for the euro.</P>
      <P>Other activities planned by the campaign for the remainder of the changeover period will include a major advertising campaign using television, radio, press and Internet advertising; new information prepared and distributed to SMEs, covering cash changeover, accounting, software and guidelines for retailers; a training pack for retailers distributed to every retailer during the summer; and presentation on the relevant EMU planning issues for SMEs at meetings, conferences, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of each firm to ensure that it is able to conduct its business in euro from 1 January 2002 and the <Col N="1059" /> EMU business awareness campaign can only assist in providing the necessary information that will assist them to do this. The primary concern, therefore, for the campaign is to ensure that each business is made sufficiently aware of the need to have made the changeover by 31 December 2001 and that each company is encouraged to determine the likely scale of the changeover operation for their particular business and prepare its plan accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of the industrial property portfolio is a statutory function of IDA Ireland, as laid out in section 16 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, and, accordingly, the provision and marketing of industrial development land is a day to day matter for IDA Ireland. However, I am assured by IDA Ireland that industrial property is being provided in order to assist industrial development in the Waterford area, to facilitate the establishment or expansion of grant aided industrial undertakings supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland clients.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's strategy of achieving a better regional distribution of overseas mobile investment, away from the larger urban centres such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, is to present companies with credible alternatives, which go as far as possible towards meeting their demands. The main demands are easy access to international airports; larger population centres with a strong base of third level graduates; and availability of high quality business and technology parks, with attractive office and industrial buildings.</P>
      <P>The agency's strategy for inward investment in County Waterford, which will impact positively on Lismore, is to focus on Waterford city and Dungarvan, in the growth sectors, such as information and communications technology for new greenfield investment and working with existing overseas companies to win expansions. Specifically, in the west Waterford area, IDA Ireland's main focus is the promotion of the privately owned 27,000 square feet advance factory, available in Dungarvan. Also, the agency has recently acquired a 35 acre site, located adjacent to the existing IDA Ireland industrial estate in the town, which will be developed as a business park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, IDA Ireland is committed to increasing the number of staff in Waterford by between ten and 15 personnel and these will include sectoral specialists who will actively work on the development of Waterford by building on its strengths as a base for foreign investment. IDA Ireland works in close co-operation with the enterprise board and the educational institutions <Col N="1061" /> in west Waterford and in particular with Enterprise Ireland in marketing and providing suitable land and buildings to the indigenous sector.</P>
    <P>In this regard, while the establishment of business parks is the responsibility of IDA, I am informed that Enterprise Ireland is currently in discussion with a local community group in Lismore, regarding the provision of financial assistance towards a community enterprise centre. Enterprise Ireland has already approved financial support towards the establishment of community enterprise centres in Cappoquin and Tallow in the west Waterford area.</P>
    <P>I further understand that Enterprise Ireland has eight development advisers based in the Waterford regional office. Their role is to maintain regular contact with its client companies in Waterford and to work with them to offer the full range of EI services. The agency will continue to provide financial assistance to individual companies in Waterford to help them to improve capability and competitiveness and to increase sales, exports and employment. It should also be noted that the provision of land for industrial development is not confined to IDA Ireland alone. The role for the private sector and the local authority in making lands available for both FDI projects and the needs of local enterprise must not be overlooked in the context of the need to assist enterprise development.</P>

      <P>It should be noted that over 18,000 work permits were issued last year which shows that the scheme is responsive to business needs. In addition I introduced in June last a new scheme whereby non-EEA nationals in certain designated categories of occupation may come to Ireland, on foot of an offer of employment from an Irish employer, to work for a period of up to two years. In such cases employers do not have to apply for work permits and non nationals in the sectors concerned, information and computing technologies professionals and technicians, construction professionals and registered nurses, can make application themselves to the Irish embassy or consulate in the country concerned for a work visa/authorisation to come to Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department is prepared to consider how the working visa/authorisation arrangements might be extended to additional sectors, as appropriate. I have established an immigration policy advisory committee which includes the social partners and the advice of the committee will be sought in regard to any specific proposals for extension or amendment of this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that insurers have signalled increases in employers' liability insurance premiums for this year. Insurers have pointed to the increased cost of settling claims as the cause for the projected increase. The number of new claims reported under employers' liability insurance by the Irish Insurance Federation to the Health and Safety Authority decreased from 9,758 in 1997 to 9,211 in 1999. Central Statistics Office figures, also available to the Health and Safety Authority, seem to bear this out showing that the rate of incidents involving more than three days absence fell from 1,746 per 100,000 workers in 1998 to 1,049 in 1999.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening in the pricing or underwriting of insurance. Accordingly, to address the high level of costs in insurance, a number of initiatives are under way. Proposals will be put to Government shortly, the objective of which is to reduce the costs of delivery of personal injury compensation. In addition, there have been a number of initiatives to encourage greater health and safety in the workplace. In particular, the social partners, the insurance industry and the Department have promoted the workplace safety initiative. This is designed to reduce accidents in the workplace and, in the unfortunate event that they occur, to provide procedures that are fair to and supportive of the injured worker. The initiative will continue to be promoted in the coming year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 119 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic boom means that there are plenty of employment opportunities available for all those who are in a position to avail of them. Labour shortages mean that employers have to look at all available sources to meet their needs. The importance of older people in the workforce will grow in coming years with the population under 25 set to fall while the numbers in the older <Col N="1064" /> age groups are forecast to rise. Given these trends, we have to look at ways of encouraging older people, embracing retired persons and women in the home, who wish to do so, to return to the workforce, as well as assisting older unemployed in their transition to employment.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy of reducing the overall tax burden on labour, the reform of the tax system and the individualisation of the standard rate tax band all serve to increase the incentive to persons returning to work. This policy will act as an incentive for older people to continue working, for women returnees and older unemployed to seek and take up a job and for retired persons to return to the workforce, especially those who may wish to work part-time to supplement their income.</P>
    <P>As part of further initiatives in this area, I am asking FÁS to examine the immediate steps that can be taken to afford older persons the appropriate opportunities to take up suitable vacancies, and in exploring possibilities to hold discussions with employer organisations about those issues. Longer-term issues in that area of pensions, for example, will also need consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that employer liability premiums will be increasing this year, my understanding is that these increases are necessitated by a number of factors, including the increasing cost of settling claims. Insurers have cited, in particular, increases in health care costs, as medical treatment becomes more sophisticated.</P>
      <P>In relation to reducing the level of workplace accidents, there are a number of actions and initiatives being taken with a view to encouraging safer working practices, reducing the incidences of workplace accidents, and the accompanying costs to both workers and employers.</P>
      <P>One important initiative is the workplace safety initiative. This initiative is supported and promoted by the ICTU, IBEC, the Health and Safety Authority, my Department and the Irish Insurance Federation. Under this initiative a voluntary code on safe working and accident prevention has been developed. Many companies have already adopted the voluntary code as proposed under this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority, which is the State body with responsibility for the administration of workplace health and safety legislation, promotes and enforces good standards in <Col N="1065" /> workplace safety across all sectors. Working with employer and employee representatives, it seeks to ensure those in control of workplaces adopt safe working practices, as required by law. Advice and assistance is available from the authority's headquarters and regional offices.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority, in its broadly-based programme of work for 2001, has set itself a target of 14,300 workplace inspections in all sectors with a particular focus on high risk sectors such as agriculture and construction, and on problem areas including manual handling, workplace vehicles and working at heights. In addition, the authority plans an extensive campaign of promotional activities which will build on the awareness-raising initiative undertaken in 2000, aimed not only at informing the public of the major health and safety issues but also of the practical actions that must be taken to ensure a safer working environment.</P>
    <P>In the area of business support and education, the authority's aim for 2001 is to support small and medium enterprises and safety representatives to enable them to proactively deal with safety and health issues and improve workplace safety and health performance, and to place safety and health on the curriculum at all levels in the education system.</P>
    <P>The authority also aims to work with Departments and public bodies to ensure that good workplace safety and health is maintained in their areas and is on their agenda.</P>

      <P>Since the Government came to office the rate of unemployment has decreased from 10.3% to 3.6%, based on the standardised unemployment rate at end February 2001. The absolute number of persons unemployed has fallen by more than half during this period. Of the substantial overall fall in unemployment nearly two-thirds was accounted for by a fall in long-term unemployment. The long-term unemployment rate is now down to 1.4%.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is at a historically low level based on the ILO measure of unemployment. Ireland has one of the lowest rates of unemployment in the European Union where the current average unemployment rate is 8.1%. Additionally, the end February seasonally adjusted live register figure, released by the Central Statistics Office on 2 March 2001, is the lowest in 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various policies have contributed to the success in reducing unemployment, including the large scale jobs growth that has been achieved which in turn has been the result of sound macro-economic polices, fiscal polices aimed at making it attractive for persons to seek and take-up a job together with a range of polices to assist unemployed reintegrate into the labour market. While the overall level of unemployment is at a historically low level, there are nevertheless pockets of unemployment and disadvantaged groups who have yet to benefit fully from our strong economic and employment growth. A range of policies are in place and targeted supports are available to assist the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups reintegrate into the open labour market. These supports include targeted training and education programmes provided by FÁS, the education sector and the local employment service, including programmes aimed at tackling adult literacy and numeracy; community employment and the back-to-work allowance scheme which are specifically targeted at long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups; social economy programme which was launched last year and is aimed at providing employment opportunities through services to help regenerate disadvantaged areas. The programme is targeted at long-term unemployed over 35 years, travellers and disabled persons who meet the programme eligibility criteria; the national development plan also acts to facilitate the dispersal of economic and employment <Col N="1067" /> growth throughout the regions and provides for substantial expenditure on employment and human resources development and infrastructure including public transport.</P>
    <P>As recommended in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the national minimum hourly rate of pay is set to increase both this year and next. From 1 July 2001 the rate will be £4.70 and from 1 October 2002 the rate will be £5. These increased rates were accepted by both ICTU and IBEC. In addition to increasing the national minimum wage, the Government continues to improve the position of the low paid through tax reform and tax reductions. I am satisfied that the national minimum wage acts as an incentive for persons to seek and take-up work.</P>

      <P>In order to facilitate the continued growth of the economy, the Government established in 1997 the expert group on future skills needs to forecast future skills requirements and to develop overall strategies to address identified labour force requirements. Progress on the implementation of its recommendations is set out in the group's annual report.</P>
      <P>A wide range of programmes are operated by FÁS aimed at increasing the supply of trained people in line with the skill requirements of the economy. These programmes take account of the EGFSN's work. In addition, EI, IDA, Shannon, CEBs and the training networks programme, Skillnets, offer a range of supports to up-skill people in employment. My Department is also pursuing a skills based immigration based policy, notably through the FÁS Jobs Ireland campaign and work permits and visas schemes, to supply skills needs of the economy which cannot be indigenously met.</P>

      <P>The advent of social partnership and the successful implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, in particular, has meant that work practice rigidities are no longer a significant factor in industrial relations. Moreover, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance has been given an enhanced role under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness further to develop enterprise level partnership. Approaches have been tested in pilot schemes which show that benefits can accrue to both workers and employers by means of a participative approach. Where solutions are not agreed through direct dialogue between employers and workers' representatives the State provides third party machinery via the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. I am confident, therefore, that work practice rigidities do not impact on our international competitiveness nor on our overall economic performance which remains buoyant.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulatory reform is one of the themes of the SMI/Delivering Better Government modernisation programme. The regulatory reform agenda is an important one and its original focus on reducing red tape has been broadened to include issues such as improving competitiveness and reducing the burden of compliance on businesses and citizens. These are issues which are priorities for the Government and ones in which my colleagues, in particular the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment and the Minister for Public Enterprise, have a particular interest and responsibility.</P>
      <P>Steady progress has been made in relation to the action programme &ldquo;Reducing Red Tape&rdquo; as follows. On accessibility, the Statute Book has been made available in electronic format and as part of their e-public service strategies, Departments-offices will be increasingly using web based technologies to publish regulations, application forms and explanatory information. On quality <i>versus</i> quantity, Departments-offices are required under amended Cabinet procedures to use a quality regulation check list for each new legislative proposal. On simplification, the new statute law revision unit in the Attorney General's office is preparing for a comprehensive programme of restatement which it is expected will commence later this year subject to the enactment of the statute law restatement Bill.</P>
      <P>On elimination of unnecessary regulation, Departments and offices have been asked to examine their primary and secondary legislation frameworks to identify scope for revision, repeal and consolidation. This will form the basis of a prioritised work programme which is being finalised by the statute law revision unit in the Attorney General's office. A dedicated regulatory reform unit has been set up in my Department to co-ordinate the delivery of the regulatory reform agenda. Over the past year, however, the major project in the regulatory reform area has been Ireland's participation in an OECD review of regulatory reform in Ireland. I understand that this review is at its final stages and I expect that the report will be presented to the Government in April 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to my recent press statement in which I indicated that I am aware of allegations and concern about exploitation of immigrant labour. I have made it quite clear that I do not intend to preside over a situation whereby a small number of employers will be allowed to get away with exploiting such people.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity also to once again state that labour law makes no distinction between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers and, as such, immigrant workers are entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections as their Irish colleagues. The labour inspectorate of my Department, which operates a fair, objective and impartial service without any differentiation with respect to nationality, will investigate any complaints about infringements of employment rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to allegations concerning certain employment agencies being involved in the abuse of immigrant workers' employment rights, the labour inspectorate in my Department has been, and is, engaged in a range of ongoing investigations. The Employment Agency Act, 1971, provides for the control and regulation of employment agencies. Employment agency activity is monitored and regulated by means of a licensing scheme. Under the terms of the Act a person shall not carry on the business of an employment agency except under, and in accordance with, a licence under that Act. In assessing applications, my Department operates a policy of strict adherence to all of the licensing criteria. In particular, the 1971 Act permits employment agencies to charge placement fees to the employers for whom they source foreign workers but it precludes them <Col N="1077" /> from charging such fees to the individual workers concerned.</P>
    <P>In general our employment rights legislation establishes the minimum statutory rights applicable to all 1.8 million people working in Ireland at present whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill, national or non-national. Where there is a question as to a differentiation in the treatment of one worker over another the provisions of equality legislation come into play once the statutory minimum requirements of employment rights legislation are satisfied.</P>
    <P>While investigations continue into alleged abuses of immigrant workers employment rights, my Department is actively pursuing a number of specific initiatives as follows: possibilities for administrative co-operation with regulatory authorities in other countries are being examined as a means to control extortionate fee charging by employment agencies which facilitate the placement of foreign workers in Ireland; a fundamental review of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, is under way to determine the nature and scope of regulatory control appropriate to modern practices in the employment agency business; changes have been approved in the administrative procedures for the issue of work permits so as to better protect the employment rights of the immigrant workers concerned; the labour inspectorate business plan for the year has as a key task a specific and targeted enforcement campaign in employments hiring foreign workers as well as sectors where such workers are employed; the labour inspectorate is engaged in a systematic investigation of recent reports alleging abuses affecting foreign nursing and hotel/catering sector staff; relevant employers and employment agencies are being followed in this process with a view to prosecutions; it is intended that, as soon as is practicable, work permits will be accompanied by an explanatory document setting out the essential elements of employment rights legislation and protections for workers. This material will be presented in various languages.</P>

      <P>The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, provides that goods should be of merchantable quality, fit for the purpose which they are intended and as described. This is an area of civil law and if goods or services purchased do not meet this criteria the consumer is normally entitled to a repair, replacement or refund, whichever is agreed between the supplier and the consumer to be most appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that as proof of purchase is generally required in the event of a dispute, it is the practice of most retailers to provide receipts. Where this is not the case it is open to a consumer to request a receipt, and if told that this will not be available to take their custom elsewhere. Neither my Department nor the Director of Consumer Affairs is aware of any difficulties being experienced by consumers in this area and from a practical point of view I do not see what purpose there would be in introducing a legal obligation of the type suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Based on a FÁS audit of CE schools services undertaken in November 1999 there were 5,804 community employment, CE, participants employed in the primary and secondary levels as secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants at a cost of £46 million. Since then the number engaged in schools services has been reduced to 4,514 at a cost of £36 million, according to a second audit of services undertaken by FÁS in September 2000. I expect that a decision will be arrived at in the near future on my Department's proposal to transfer funding at a level equivalent to the 1999 FÁS audit of CE services to the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Following the proposed mainstreaming of CE schools services and the associated funding, CE services to schools will be discontinued and the overall number of participants on the programme will be reduced accordingly. Projects exclusively related to schools will, as a direct result of the mainstreaming process, be discontinued.</P>
      <P>My Department is fully aware of the need to ensure that due recognition is given to the experience in schools posts gained by CE participants when filling vacancies arising under the mainstreaming process. This matter is being given full consideration in my Department's discussions with the Department of Education and Science. I hope to have the new funding arrangements for schools in place in the very near future and the process of discontinuing CE involvement in schools should be well advanced by the year end.</P>

      <P>On 26 July 1999 the Government decided to allow asylum seekers who had arrived in the State before that date and had made application for asylum, to seek employment, as their application for asylum became 12 months old. This permission to seek employment also permitted asylum seekers, who were the subject of the Government decision, to undertake training with FÁS, the national training authority. In that connection FÁS has established an asylum seekers unit with branches in Tallaght and Blanchardstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9(4)(f2&gt;b) of the Refugee Act, 1996, commenced in November 2000, prohibits applicants for refugee status from seeking or entering employment or carrying on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final <Col N="1081" /> determination of their application. In the circumstances it would clearly not be appropriate for FÁS to offer training to any other group of asylum seekers other than those covered by the Government decision of July 1999.

This programme is especially designed to assist women to plan and prepare for a return to work and is provided on both a full-time and part-time basis.

The cancellation of many public events and activities at this time is a necessary part of the Government's overall strategy to prevent the introduction of foot and mouth disease into Ireland. This approach has the widespread support of the Irish public who recognise that the long-term economic benefits of keeping out foot and mouth disease far outweigh the short-term pain of the cancellation of events and activities associated with the celebration of St. Patrick's Day. Accordingly, I feel that on balance a muted celebration of St. Patrick's Day on this one exceptional occasion will be a small price to pay if it contributes to the success of our efforts to prevent this dreadful disease from spreading to our country.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to persons who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the qualifying PRSI conditions. Persons in receipt of an invalidity pension are automatically eligible for participation on community employment, CE. However, spouses must satisfy the qualifying criteria in their own right before being eligible to participate in the CE programme.</P>

      <Col N="1084" /> As part of the continuing need to facilitate the reintegration of women back into the workforce, the general terms and conditions relating to participation on CE have been reviewed and adjusted in the context of both the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure the programme and the recommendations contained in the P2000 report on facilitating women's access to labour market opportunities. Direct access to the programme has been extended to widows/widowers, qualified adults of long-term unemployed persons, deserted wives benefit recipients and persons previously in receipt of the carers allowance.</P>
    <P>The eligibility of further categories of persons for participation in CE, including that of qualified adults, adult dependants, of invalidity pension recipients, will be kept under continuing review by my Department.</P>

      <P>Apart from one isolated incident which occurred in early November 2000 in the Companies Registration Office, CRO, which is an executive office of my Department, neither my Department's computer system nor website has been the subject of a hacking attempt in the past three years. The Department's web server is hosted with an internet service provider, ISP, in a specialist web farm. The benefit of having the web server hosted in a web farm is that the Department can be assured that the highest level of preventative security measures are in place and are regularly reviewed and updated.</P>
      <P>The isolated attempt to hack into one computer system in the CRO failed as it was very quickly detected and remedial action was undertaken to tighten security on this system. It must be recognised that individuals who engage in hacking activities do so on an ongoing basis and are extremely computer literate. Their challenge is to outmanoeuvre technological advances in security systems. This is why all organisations must remain vigilant in this regard at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is conscious of the need to stay abreast of technological advances in the area of computer security. Accordingly, it is engaging in a full security review of all systems. The CRO is also engaged in this process and has commissioned a detailed study of computer security. When the results of this study have been considered, additional work as appropriate will be <Col N="1085" /> undertaken to ensure, in so far as possible, that systems are securely protected against attack.</P>

      <P>The Kinsale Head gas field is located in 90 metres of water 45km from shore whereas the Corrib gas field is located in about 350 metres of water 65km for the coast. The Kinsale field was developed in the 1970s at which time there was not the possibility of a subsea development. It has two platforms fixed on the sea bed. If it was to be developed today the preferred cost effective system would be a subsea development without field platforms. The cost effective and optimum development system for Corrib is a subsea development with processing at a terminal onshore. If processing were to take place in field it would require deployment of floating facilities which, as indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 73 of 15 February 2001, would mean that production would be weather sensitive, a serious drawback in the hostile environment at Corrib. Increased capital and operational expenditures would be needed which could make the development uneconomic and it would have serious safety implications.</P>

      <P>Following discussions with the <Col N="1088" /> European Commission, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, announced, in March last, significant increases averaging 30% in the rate of afforestation grants and premiums for those planting from 1 October 1999.</P>
      <P>The afforestation grant is a once off payment, made in two instalments, which is aimed at compensating farmers for the costs associated with the establishment of the plantation. I do not intend to extend increased grants to those who planted before 1 October 1999. I am, however, attempting to secure increases in the level of annual forest premiums for those who planted prior to 1 October 1999. Despite protracted negotiations, the European Commission refused to agree to co-fund similar increases in the forest premiums paid to those who planted before that date.</P>
      <P>I am now considering possible funding from the Exchequer for those who planted prior to 1 October 1999. The estimated annual cost of such at present is £3.4 million. In view of the State aids aspect, any decision to have the cost borne by the Exchequer would also require European Commission agreement.</P>

      <Quest>if he has carried out any assessment of the desirability from the viewpoint of a national port policy of further development of Dublin Port by way of bay infill, compared to alternatives such as intensifying the use of existing facilities in the port, or developing other locations where cargo could be landed and dispatched which would not necessitate bringing products through the city.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The application in hand from Dublin Port Company for permission to reclaim 25 hectares of the State foreshore derives from the need of Dublin Port to cater for increasing levels of throughput. It is acknowledged that Dublin Port is and will continue to be the premier port in the country. Throughput has risen from 6.1 million tonnes in 1989 to 15.2 million in 1999 and is forecast to reach 23.7 million tonnes by 2007. <Col N="1089" /> It handles by far the largest proportion of the country's unitised freight, some 71%, and has a high prospective growth over the coming seven years.</P>
      <P>An expert EU co-financed assessment of port access requirements nationally concluded in 2000 that Dublin will increasingly face capacity constraints over the next ten years. Over the period to 2006, immediate capacity constraints will be felt in the unitised modes and ongoing expansion of facilities will be a priority. If land for expansion is unavailable, the port will have to concentrate its developments on increasing the utilisation of existing land and facilities and possibly forgoing existing lower value trades which are space intensive.</P>
      <P>Diversion of traffic to other ports, including other east coast ports, must be among the alternatives considered in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks limiting the flow of imports and exports so vital to the sustained growth of the economy. That being said, expansion of capacity-handling and berthage will be inevitable over the coming years.</P>
      <P>It is my policy to encourage shipping operators and the ports industry in general to maximise utilisation of capacity outside of Dublin and enhance competitiveness. In order to strengthen the contribution of east coast ports I have decided that both Dundalk and Wicklow will shortly become commercial State port companies joining Dublin and Drogheda. Together with Rosslare and Greenore this will strengthen the capacity of the east coast ports industry in servicing the central and southern shipping corridors. A direct shipping service which commenced last October between Drogheda and Rotterdam will also help to reduce the pressure on Dublin Port and I am encouraging other ports and shipping operators to follow this lead.</P>
      <P>In addition, so as to assist in the further development of port policy, I recently announced the establishment of an expert task force on transport logistics, under the chairmanship of Dr. John Mangan of the Irish Management Institute, which will consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the prospects for increasing the volume of port traffic which is transported by rail and the transfer of port generated freight traffic from road to rail, including the development of rail head facilities at existing ports, and establish realistic targets to be achieved; the prospects for transport of rail freight by night-off peak; opportunities for traffic diversion, including by rail, by pipeline, including relocation of oil tank farms to other less congested ports outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>The group will also seek to identify other imaginative proposals to reduce congestion and make port access-egress more efficient; identify cost effective options for the movement of traffic through Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first meeting of the task force is scheduled for 27 March next and I have asked the chairman to report back to me within six months if possible. The task force will at my direction invite sub<Col N="1090" /> missions or representations from all interested persons as part of a comprehensive consultative process.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland which proposes to develop the Corrib gas field sought from me some time ago in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, a written opinion on the information to be contained in an environmental impact statement which must accompany its plan of development for the field. To assist me in preparing this opinion, I consulted with An Taisce which is a prescribed body under the 1960 Act to which the environmental impact statement must be furnished for comment. The information received from An Taisce was incorporated in my written opinion which I furnished to Enterprise Energy Ireland. It is expected that this opinion will be considered by Enterprise Energy Ireland in the context of preparing its EIS to accompany its plan of development. On receipt of this EIS I will then refer it to An Taisce for comment. There is nothing to prevent An Taisce making public the advice it gave me in relation to the carrying out of an EIS by Enterprise Energy Ireland.</P>

      <P>The comprehensive strategic review of current and future infrastructural needs at Dunmore East Fishery Harbour commissioned by my Department has now been completed. Recommendations arising regarding possible infrastructural upgrading and modernisation at Dunmore East Harbour are being evaluated. These recommendations will be addressed in the context of the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006. The plan makes a substantial provision of £60 million for development of fishery harbours and related facilities.</P>

Waterford County Council submitted a proposal to my Department and to the Depart<Col N="1092" /> ment of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to proposed development works at Helvick. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands agreed to fund a site investigation at Helvick in 2000.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should stress, however, that because of the proximity of commercial mussel beds and the risk to human health of viral contamination from sewage receiving only secondary treatment I will have to insist, as a minimum, on provision for retrofitting of UV or equivalent treatment. This would ensure that, if monitoring of the operation of the plant and the impact of the discharge on <Col N="1093" /> mussels warranted it, the necessary works to upgrade the plant could be expeditiously undertaken at reasonable cost. Until the council indicates that it is prepared to accept this condition I cannot, in the interests of human health, progress the matter further. The polluter pays principle must apply here and, in addition to the health issues, I also have to consider the impact on the livelihoods of the fishermen.</P>

      <P>The Government approved strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector in Ireland, Growing for the Future, which was published in 1996, provides a long-term framework for the expansion of the sector from nurseries through to timber product industries and encompasses a range of related issues such as fostering of sustainable development, the creation of added-value, the development of new competence and skills and the generation of multiple benefit returns. Significantly, the plan also provides for increasing the national forest estate to 17% of available land by 2030.</P>
      <P>The broadleaf task force reported on how best to maximise the national broadleaf forest resource in the context of its commercial, environmental and recreational potential and submitted its recommendations for consideration in the formulation of Growing for the Future. These recommendations are reflected throughout the strategic plan in the context of greater broadleaf utilisation, further research, greater promotion and public awareness of broadleaves.</P>
      <P>In overall terms, it is planned during the period of the rural development plan to increase planting of broadleaves from 20% at present to 30% by 2006. In this regard, the grant and premium schemes have been revised with a view to encouraging increased broadleaf planting.</P>

      <P>This question relates to the grounding of a vessel at Drogheda Port on 28 February this year and on 14 March last year. Such occurrences are operational matters for the relevant port company or harbour authority in circumstances where the incident takes place within the <Col N="1094" /> jurisdictional limits of such statutory bodies. I am advised that on the occasions in question, in accordance with standard practice, Drogheda Port Company notified the relevant emergency agencies, including the Irish Coast Guard, and these were placed on an appropriate readiness footing. In the event, on both occasions the vessel was soon successfully refloated without any injury to persons or any damage to the environment or the vessel. Drogheda Port Company reviews its port safety procedures on an ongoing basis to minimise the risk of such incidents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to the development of the maritime sector, including the expansion of the Irish registered fleet. This commitment has been given concrete expression by the introduction in recent years of a number of fiscal reliefs for the sector: concessions in the corporation tax area for shipping associated leases; full refunds of employer's PRSI payments for seafarers; introduction of a special £5,000 seafarer's income tax allowance, with access to that concession made easier in the December 2000 budget &ndash; the budget provided for a reduction from 169 to 161 in the number of days a seafarer is required to be on a voyage to or from a foreign port to qualify for the allowance; the introduction of a 12.5% rate of corporation tax for profits from shipping, from 1 January, 2001 instead of 1 January, 2003, that is, two years ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government has established a dedicated statutory development agency for shipping, shipping services and seafarer training &ndash; Irish Maritime Development Office. The establishment of a new National Maritime College at Ringaskiddy is being progressed to meet Ireland's naval and merchant marine seafarer training requirements.</P>
      <P>I am also committed to the overhaul of registration procedures for merchant ships. The Irish Maritime Development Office will take over and manage the modernised ship register later this year.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific issue of a tonnage tax, the Irish Maritime Development Office has made a strong case for the introduction of incentives and fiscal measures for the shipping sector beyond those already in place. At the forefront of the proposals is the introduction of a tonnage tax in line with other EU member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range of fiscal measures, reliefs and incentives proposed by the IMDO to regenerate the shipping industry and shipping services sector <Col N="1095" /> remain under consideration, including the introduction of a tonnage tax.</P>
    <P>Recent remarks by Commissioner De Palacio, reported in the specialist shipping press, on the possible introduction of a pan-European tonnage tax are very encouraging and are helpful in the context of pressing the case for a tonnage tax with the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>Under the Government's renewal of the whitefish fleet programme, 1998-2001, significant grant aid has been made available for the purchase of new and modern second-hand vessels, as well as funding to modernise existing vessels and to purchase and install state-of-the-art safety equipment. The overall objective of the programme has been to enhance the operational and technical efficiency, competitiveness and safety of the whitefish fleet.</P>
      <P>By the end of last year 728 projects have been approved involving total investment of some £70 million. These projects include the introduction of 31 new vessels and 21 second-hand vessels, 77 vessel modernisations and the installation of safety equipment on 599 vessels.</P>
      <P>In parallel, and following agreement with the Commission on the Community Support Framework, 2000-06, the new round of investment support strategies for the fleet and the seafood industry as a whole is being put in place by my Department. Under the national development plan £171 million will underpin overall investment strategies for the sector.</P>
      <P>My Department is working with BIM to finalise the detailed grant schemes which will strategically focus on the further enhancement of the safety, quality, efficiency and competitiveness of the whitefish fleet. I expect that EU approval under state aid guidelines will be secured shortly at which stage I will announce details of the new fleet investment initiative.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the extent to which there are satisfactory indications in respect of oil, gas or other mineral explorations offshore or on land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>There are 21 offshore exploration licences, seven licensing options and ten petroleum prospecting licences in place. This shows a decline from a peak of 32 exploration licences in 1997. Furthermore, a number of exploration companies granted licences under a licensing round in 1997 have indicated their intention to relinquish these licences this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 2001 will, however, see a substantial increase in offshore drilling activity with at least three exploration wells, one appraisal well and two development wells being drilled, but, well commitments beyond 2001 only amount to between three and six for the entire offshore. With this in mind I commenced an initiative aimed at both conserving certain areas of the offshore by closing them off from development for the moment and gauging interest on the part of <Col N="1099" /> the industry in making well commitments in certain other limited areas. To that end, I have started a consultation process involving companies which are licence holders here in order to gauge their view on whether well commitments might be forthcoming in the event that a limited number of new licences might be offered.</P>
    <P>While the Government would obviously like to see the national energy grid being enhanced through the development and exploitation of our natural resources, this will depend on further significant offshore hydrocarbon discoveries. In the meantime, as the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise announced recently, Bord Gáis Éireann is to proceed with its proposal for a second natural gas interconnector from Scotland to Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my reply of 8 February 2001 to a similar question raised by the Deputy in relation to satisfactory indications from offshore exploration, there are developments in relation to two hydrocarbon discoveries, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oilfield.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland declared the Corrib gas field commercial in January this year on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil and Marathon, and sought a lease from me for its development. This is being considered and evaluated by my Department. Enterprise Energy Ireland has plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expects the field to be in production for about 15 years.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the Helvick oilfield is that Providence Resources completed an appraisal well on the oilfield in the Celtic Sea in September last year. The drilling and tests results have been reviewed in detail over the last few months. Although the tests results on the well confirmed the good reservoir and oil characteristics seen on the original Helvick oil discovery well in 1983, further detailed analysis has indicated that the Helvick reservoir is much smaller than had been hoped and is highly compartmentalised. Accordingly Providence Resources has concluded that a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; development of Helvick cannot be justified and, therefore, that Helvick is not commercial.</P>
    <P>Providence Resources has other interests in the Celtic Sea, which include blocks 50/6, 50/7, 50/11 and the Ardmore gas prospect. The company has indicated that it remains committed to realising value from its Celtic Sea assets but the fact that Helvick cannot be made commercial has resulted in Providence Resources reviewing its plans for the Celtic Sea as a whole and conducting a strategic appraisal of a number of business development options. My Department is in discussion with Providence Resources about restructuring its authorisations in the east Celtic Sea.</P>
    <P>There is a continuing high level of interest shown in exploration for non-petroleum minerals but no significant new developments have taken place since my answer of 8 February. It is gratifying that we have not only maintained, but <Col N="1100" /> increased in real terms, our share of world exploration funding in the context of a major global cutback over the past three years. The most recent report that I laid before the Houses under the Minerals Development Acts showed that at the end of December 2000 there were 480 prospecting licences being operated. The number of licences has increased over the last three years. We are actively engaged in promoting investment interest in minerals exploration from overseas companies in order to keep the level of exploration in the country as high as possible.</P>
    <P>As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for minerals exploration, my Department is carrying out a comparative study of international royalty and tax regimes. We are examining the preliminary results of that study. That examination and the further study results will inform policy decisions in the future and allow us to maintain our competitive status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the question relates to regulations governing the safe operation of Irish registered merchant vessels and fishing vessels. In relation to merchant vessels my aim is to ensure that the appropriate regulatory framework is in place to ensure that all Irish registered vessels operating to and from Ireland are constructed, maintained and operated to the highest international safety standards which emanate from the safety conventions of the International Maritime Organisation and from initiatives at European Union level. To that end, a continuing programme of work is under way in my Department to update our maritime law and ensure that all EU directives and all relevant IMO safety conventions, including amendments to SOLAS, Safety of Life at Sea, and STCW, Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping, are fully implemented.</P>
      <P>Radio regulations governing all sizes of fishing vessels were introduced in 1998. Legislation providing for a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres and over in length was also introduced in 1998 and required all such fishing vessels built since the mid-1980s to comply with the requirements of the Torremolinos international convention for the safety of fishing vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For fishing vessels of less than 24 metres, there are extensive regulations in place which cover life-saving appliances, fire-fighting equipment and radio equipment. Work is well advanced on safety regulations for vessels of 12 to 24 metres <Col N="1101" /> and from six to 12 metres which have been the subject of consultation with the fishing industry. A code of safety practice for vessels under six metres is also being developed. In addition, the manning requirements and qualifications for officers on fishing vessels are in line with the STCW (F) (Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping) Fishing Convention, 1995 which ensures that our fishing vessels are manned by highly trained professional crews.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of all these regulations is carried out by the Marine Survey Office of my Department which inspects vessels to ensure that they are complying with the safety standards laid down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has always taken a full and active part in European and International matters concerning the prevention of pollution at sea. Ireland led the campaign at the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, to have the INF code made mandatory and following this the EU adopted a directive requiring all vessels carrying such materials bound for or leaving a Community port to comply with strict notification and controls.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the EU directive on port state control, inspections relevant to pollution prevention, safety related matters and crew ability and competence are carried out on foreign vessels, including tankers, entering our ports. When deficiencies are noted, the vessel may be detained until they have been rectified.</P>
      <P>Since the <i>Erika</i> incident in December 1999, we have participated in the drawing up of measures which include the phasing out of certain single hulled tankers in favour of double hulled types, improvements in liability regimes, enhanced inspection of foreign ships, very stringent condition assessment of certain older tankers and fitting of data recorders &ndash; black boxes.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, the European Union adopted a directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues. The purpose of the directive is to improve the availability and use of port reception facilities for such waste. Regulations will need to be introduced to give effect to the directive in Irish law by December 2002 and arrangements made for implementation.</P>

      <P>Following discussions with the European Commission, the Minister of State, Deputy Bryne, announced, in March last, significant increases averaging 30% in the rate of afforestation grants and premiums for those planting from 1 October 1999.</P>
      <P>The afforestation grant is a once-off payment, made in two instalments, which is aimed at compensating farmers for the costs associated with the establishment of the plantation. I do not intend to extend increased grants to those who planted before 1 October 1999. I am, however, attempting to secure increases in the level of annual forest premiums for those who planted prior to 1 October 1999. Despite protracted negotiations, the European Commission refused to agree to co-fund similar increases in the forest premiums paid to those who planted before that date.</P>
      <P>I am now considering possible funding from the Exchequer for those who planted prior to 1 October 1999. The estimated annual cost of such is £3.4 million. In view of the State aids aspect, any decision to have the cost borne by the Exchequer would also require European Commission agreement.</P>

      <P>Last month I launched the commissioned report on future directions for the seafood processing sector and I have arranged for a copy of the report to be forwarded to the Deputy. This report, which was carried out in full consultation with the industry, sets out strategies to address the key challenges facing the sector and to develop the industry over the short to medium term. The report is guiding formulation of the overall strategy for investment support measures for the sector under the NDP. Key challenges identified in the study include strategies for improving the competitive position of seafood products on international markets, the scale of the industry, value added and research and development priorities, the consistency of raw material supply and capacity utilisation within the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Under the national development plan, £25 million in grant aid, leading to total investment of some £100 million, will support the further development of seafood processing to build a competitive, value added capability of scale to the highest quality and technological standards.</P>
    <P>Work on investment schemes based on the findings and recommendations of the independent study is under way by my Department in consultation with Enterprise Ireland, BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta. I expect that the drafting of schemes will be completed within the next month at which stage EU state aid approval will be sought for the investment measures. I will announce details of the scheme shortly thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 179 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UNFPA's programme in China has projects in 32 poor counties. It was requested by the Chinese Government and approved by the 36 member state UNFPA executive board. The programme adheres strictly to the voluntary, human rights-based approach to reproductive health and family planning stipulated by the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The abolition of quotas and targets in the 32 counties was a condition of UNFPA assistance. Funds were released only after the UNFPA field office received official written communication from <Col N="1108" /> provincial-local authorities that quotas and targets had been removed from participating counties. It has been agreed with the Chinese Government that the project will follow all UNFPA procedures for monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the Government has agreed that the project counties will be open to monitoring visits by foreigners and that county officials would be available to talk to foreign delegations.</P>
    <P>The projects supported by the UNFPA in those counties will provide quality, client-oriented services for Chinese women and men on a voluntary, informed-consent basis in reproductive health: family planning, maternal health, including assisted deliveries, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>The fund has given repeated assurances that it does not support China's one child policy and is confident that the UNFPA programme in China will show conclusively the effectiveness of complete freedom of reproductive choice. Experience worldwide shows that the best way to influence population growth is through a human rights approach that focuses on providing high quality services to meet individual needs and desires.</P>
    <P>The assumption sometimes made is that UNFPA, because of its co-operation with Government authorities, implicitly endorses the coercive aspects of policies pursued by those authorities. The Department of Foreign Affairs can find no evidence to support this argument.</P>
    <P>In December 1997, Ireland's ambassador to China participated in a field trip organised by the UNFPA to view its programmes in China. He was completely satisfied that the UNFPA was not in any way supporting China's one child policy. Following the trip, the ambassador noted that the long-term objective informing the UNFPA programme is to encourage China's family planning system to adopt a more enlightened client-driven focus by demonstrating the efficacy of a client-oriented qualitative approach operating within the 30 counties selected by the agency.</P>
    <P>Ireland has just completed a three year term on the executive board of the UNFPA. Through its membership of the board, Ireland was able to participate directly in detailed donor discussions on UNFPA's programmes and be in a position to closely monitor the UNFPA's performance. We assumed our position on foot of the regular rotation of donor representatives. During our tenure on the board, Ireland participated actively in policy debate concerning the present and future orientations of the agency.</P>
    <P>The Department has a sufficient body of information available to it from this and other sources on which to form a positive assessment of the UNFPA's operations. On the basis of that information, and in the light of specific and repeated assurances from the UNFPA, I am satisfied that its operations are conducted in full accordance with its mandate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177, 182 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>Despite recent positive signals and statements on the part of the Algerian authorities and of a number of opposition forces for the ending of the seven years of civil conflict, there is continued opposition by some groups in Algeria to any settlement or reconciliation between the Government and its Islamist opponents. The security situation has seriously deteriorated in recent months after an improvement following the implementation of the general amnesty announced by President Bouteflika last year.</P>
      <P>Progress in the area of human rights is a major objective in Ireland's bilateral relations with Algeria. The Government has expressed its deep concern at the horrendous loss of life and the human suffering caused by the civil conflict. We continue to take every appropriate opportunity in our bilateral contacts, through the process of dialogue between Algeria and the EU, and at the United Nations, to urge the Algerian authorities to take the necessary steps that will lead to an ending of the conflict, and for the establishment of independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and for bringing those responsible to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> In our continuing discussions with our EU partners Ireland has sought to maintain a strong emphasis on effective action by the EU to advance full respect for human rights in Algeria. The EU has called for the establishment of a dialogue between the Government, opposition groups, and civil society, as a means to bring about the peaceful climate and the process of national reconciliation as called for by the people of Algeria in the national referendum held in September 1999.</P>
    <P>At the forthcoming United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland and our EU partners will again raise the situation in Algeria under agenda item 9, which concerns the question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, as on previous occasions, it appears that there would be insufficient support within the commission for the adoption of a country-specific resolution. In such circumstances, it would be counterproductive were a resolution to be proposed only to be defeated. Such a defeat would only be of benefit to the hardliners and would send an entirely wrong signal as to the progress which the international community wishes to see in Algeria.</P>
    <P>The Government of Algeria continues to oppose the appointment of a UN special rapporteur. However, it has indicated that it is willing to co-operate with the UN Human Rights Commission on the question of human rights violations. Both the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the special rapporteur on torture have ongoing mandates from the Human Rights Commission to report on situations of concern. Reports by both rapporteurs are due to be considered at the forthcoming meeting of the commission. It is expected that these would, <i>inter alia</i>, comment on developments in Algeria. The question of access for special rapporteurs to report at first hand on human rights situations of concern in a number of countries, not only Algeria, is also likely to be an issue in Geneva.</P>
    <P>In our contacts with the Algerian authorities the Government will continue to present its view that a more co-operative approach by Algeria to the utilisation of the human rights protection machinery of the United Nations, including the role of special rapporteurs, would be a constructive step in helping to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the current, tragic situation.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern with regard to the threats which have been made against the persons named in the material provided with his question. Our Embassy in Mexico City has confirmed that these people have been threatened. They are members of a trade union which, along with 50 other such groups, has been recognised by the Colombian authorities as requiring special protection. I understand that the regrettable fact is that last year alone a total of 128 trade unionists were killed in Colombia, and that already this year a further 28 have been murdered.</P>
      <P>In common with our EU partners and the wider international community, we have strongly condemned the persistent and increasing attacks by paramilitaries against human rights defenders in Colombia, including trade unionists. While we welcome the measures undertaken by the Colombian Ministry of the Interior to protect social and human rights defenders, including the establishment of a new protection programme for trade union activists and journalists, in addition to the existing and broader special programme for the protection of witnesses and threatened persons, we urge the Colombian authorities to take action to ensure that these measures are fully implemented and adequately funded. In the same context, we welcome the new proposals announced by the Colombian Government in January to tackle paramilitary groups and we urge it to take concrete measures to give full effect to these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU will continue to stress to the Colombian authorities the need to address the lack of effective judicial investigations into crimes against social and human rights defenders as well as the insufficient legal, administrative, security and financial measures to protect those social and human rights defenders who find themselves at risk. This emphasis on full respect for human rights will continue to underpin Ireland's policy toward Colombia, as well as our contribution to <Col N="1112" /> the EU programme of support for the peace process in Colombia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the provisional outturn for the aid programme in 2000 was approximately £210 million, of which £138 million is under the direct control of Ireland Aid through the Department of Foreign Affairs. Non-government organisations received approximately £19 million directly from the Department of Foreign Affairs. In addition, it is estimated that approximately £8.35 million was dispersed to NGOs via APSO and the NCDE &ndash; both organisations are directly funded by Ireland Aid. Therefore, in 2000, a total of £27.35 million was allocated to NGOs which represents almost 20% of the funds under direct Ireland Aid control for expenditure purposes. A number of Irish NGOs also receive considerable funding from multilateral agencies such as the UN and the EU to which the Government contributes from its overseas development assistance budget.</P>
      <P>The figures alluded to by the Deputy in relation to Concern and GOAL refer to 1999. In that year Ireland's aid programme amounted to £181.4 million, of which £110 million was under the direct control of Ireland Aid. NGOs received approximately £24.6 million which is equivalent to about 22% of funds under the direct control of Ireland Aid for expenditure purposes. A little over £5 million was allocated to GOAL and Concern from Ireland Aid funds, including APSO, in 1999, that is, 20% of the funding provided to NGOs. In addition both NGOs received over £6.5 million from EU funding mechanisms supported by Ireland Aid. A detailed breakdown of individual funding allocations for all NGOs and missionary groups, including GOAL and Concern, is set out in the Ireland Aid annual reports which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Development Assistance Committee of the OECD carried out an in-depth review of the Government's programme of development co-operation in 1999 which noted that by the standards of the DAC, Irish official support for NGOs represents a relatively large share of the programme. As I have mentioned on many occasions, I wish to enhance the excellent partnership which has been built with many NGOs and missionary orders over the years. The sub<Col N="1113" /> stantial funding channelled through these organisations is indicative of the belief that they are an important channel of aid delivery.</P>
    <P>The review of Ireland Aid, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, is under way and will be examining all aspects of the aid programme, including working with NGOs. The challenge ahead for all of us committed to maintaining the excellence of our development co-operation programme is how to manage the growth of our aid expenditures, while retaining and enhancing the quality on which Ireland Aid has built its international reputation. Increased expenditures by Ireland Aid or NGOs do not automatically guarantee improved quality delivery and more effective disbursement. The recent article in the <i>Trocaire Development Review </i>entitled, Some Challenges facing the Irish Government and NGOs, provides some useful thoughts and discussion on working more closely with NGOs.</P>
    <P>We must remain true to our guiding principles by working at all levels, including with NGOs, to bring about sustainable improvements in the lives of the poor. We must strive to increase our focus on the quality of outcomes and the impact of development programmes and projects. In this endeavour the Ireland Aid review committee has advertised in the national press requesting submissions to its deliberations from interested parties and stakeholders. I hope that there will a wide response in order that the aid review committee may examine as wide a range of submissions as possible. The committee will also consult with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>

However, the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in a number of states in northern Nigeria in the course of the year 2000 has exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent flogging of a 17 year old girl, Bariya Magazu, in Zamfara state, the European Union issued a statement condemning the flogging as a violation of international human rights, in particular the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Nigeria is a signatory, but also Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <Col N="1114" /> Rights which state that &ldquo;no one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&rdquo;. The statement welcomes the federal Government's efforts to ascertain that Nigerian law is in compliance with international human rights covenants.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government fully supports the enlargement process and participates positively and constructively in the accession negotiations, which are at a very advanced stage with the Czech Republic and other candidate countries. At the same time, Ireland is willing to provide any assistance possible for the candidate countries in their preparations for EU membership. Ireland is perceived by these countries as having managed its membership of the EU very well.</P>
      <P>In addition to the assistance provided under EU programmes like PHARE, Ireland has provided assistance for the Czech Republic and other candidates on a bilateral basis, in the form of advice and training for officials in preparation for accession. Czech public servants have participated in several training courses and seminars on EU issues, which have been funded and organised by my Department in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration. This programme of courses is being developed further in the lead-up to accession and I fully expect that more officials from the Czech Republic will participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contacts at all levels, Government, parliamentary and official, can be very beneficial to both candidate and member states alike. In respect of the Czech Republic, I can report that such contacts have increased considerably in recent years. I draw attention particularly to the very successful state visit paid by the President to the Czech Republic in October 1999, the visit by the Tánaiste to Prague in June 2000, the official visit of the Czech Foreign Minister to Ireland in June 2000 and the working visit by the Czech chief negotiator to Dublin on 13 March this year as just four examples of the many recent high level <Col N="1115" /> exchanges. Further intense contacts are planned at all levels in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Ireland also participates in EUTELSAT, the European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, an intergovernmental body that operates a satellite network for fixed and mobile telecommunications. EUTELSAT was formed to provide international telecommunications links but is now increasingly involved in the provision of high bandwidth data services, which allows for rapid Internet access, and in the provision of broadcast services for both radio and television. I am presently preparing to bring proposals to Government to ratify, on behalf of Ireland, an amended EUTELSAT Convention. The proposed amendments will allow the organisation to develop its position in the fast growing markets for satellite communications services and to adapt to technical, economic and regulatory developments. Through its participation in both EUTELSAT and INTELSAT, its international equivalent, Ireland is well positioned to maximise the benefits that can be achieved from the expansion of satellite services. Undertakings in Ireland will have equal access to facilities as and when they are developed and become available.</P>

      <P>The Government, both in its bilateral contacts and through dialogue between Iran and the EU, seeks <Col N="1116" /> actively to promote progress in respect for human rights in Iran. This includes the treatment of the Baha'i and other minorities.</P>
      <P>Last year Ireland and our EU partners successfully tabled resolutions at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly on the human rights situation in Iran. These resolutions both contained specific mention of the violation of the human rights of the Baha'is.</P>
      <P>The EU is preparing a resolution for the forthcoming session of the Commission of Human Rights in Geneva. As on previous occasions, it is expected that this would, <i>inter alia</i>, ask the commission to express its concern at the continuing discrimination experienced by members of the Baha'i community and to call on the Iranian authorities to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on religious grounds or against persons belonging to minorities and to address the matter in an open manner and in dialogue with the minorities concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the recent statements of the Government of President Khatami that no one in Iran should be persecuted because of their religious beliefs and that the civil rights of all Iranians should be respected regardless of their religion.

      <P>In the immediate aftermath of the incident which resulted in this tragedy and at the request of the parents, the relevant Irish honorary consul general obtained from the authorities in Spain copies of police and autopsy reports, the death certificate and the passport of their son. With regard to investigating the circumstances of the death about which there was speculation in press reports, the Department of Foreign Affairs advised the parents to engage a lawyer in the locality and gave them a list of English-speaking lawyers there.</P>
      <P>During a visit in January 1997 by the parents to the place where the incident occurred, the honorary consul general arranged a meeting for them with their lawyer and went with them to the court to collect various personal belongings and other documentation relating to the case and to view the boat involved. In June 1997 the honorary consul general wrote to the court on behalf of the parents about matters such as their request for photographs of the deceased taken in connection with the autopsy and the return of clothes and other personal property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> The investigation of the circumstances of this young man's death is primarily a matter for the police and judicial authorities in Spain and the UK and I have to be careful not to appear to be interfering with the judicial process. Progress in the investigation has been frustratingly slow up to now. The investigation has been closed three times by the judge in charge of it in Spain and reopened each time by a higher court. The formal process by which statements are taken from witnesses in England and sent to Spain is also extremely time consuming.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 my Department, the Embassy in Madrid and the honorary consul general have tried &ndash; by numerous contacts with the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the British Home Office and the Garda Síochána Interpol Liaison Office &ndash; to supplement the efforts of the parents and their lawyer to advance matters. Following recent representations to me by the parents, I have instructed that my Department and the embassies in Madrid and London make further efforts to speed up the pace at which papers are transmitted between offices and to urge that the Spanish and British authorities treat the matter with full care and attention. My Department will continue to assist the family vigorously with a view to reaching a resolution as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I have been following closely developments in the elections in Uganda and have been receiving regular reports from our Embassy in Kampala. The election was monitored by observers from South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, the Gambia and Libya, as well as by personnel from foreign embassies, including our own and those of EU member states. In addition, an NGO umbrella group, Nemgroup, deployed 17,000 monitors throughout Uganda and these were present at most polling stations.</P>
      <P>The assessment made by our Embassy and by this wide range of observers is that the election was imperfect but essentially fair. The observers acknowledged that there were malpractices, some of them serious, in a number of districts, mainly by supporters of President Museveni. However, these were deemed sufficiently restricted not to have altered the overall outcome. The Nemgroup, in a preliminary assessment, described these incidents as random and judged the elections to have been carried out generally in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that governance in poorer countries is itself a developmental issue and that, in the context of the chaos from which Uganda has emerged in a little over 15 years and the instability in the region, this generally open election between two strong contestants can be seen as a significant and positive step in the evolution of functioning democracy.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a strong supporter of Uganda and is committed to assist with its economic, and social development through a strong aid programme through which we will spend £19 million in 2001 on health, including HIV-AIDS, education, water and sanitation, roads, the productive sector and governance. The budget will be expended in accordance with a three-year country strategy negotiated with the Ugandan authorities, which is based on an agreed assessment of needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety of the Limerick to Foynes railway line and any other railway line is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann and I have, therefore, no function in the matter. However, I understand from Iarnród Éireann that the Limerick to Foynes railway line remains open for commercial freight traffic and is safe for the operation of such traffic.</P>

    <P>In addition to the above, there were three projects involving the roll-out of broadband telecommunications services in County Kerry. With regard to the first project Esat Telecom received a total of £1.5 million in aid for a project costing £3.3 million, which involved the roll-out of fibre optic cable in urban areas around the State. Tralee town was one of these areas. The project commenced in 1999 and was completed towards the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>The second project to receive funding was HEAnet, a not-for-profit organisation which delivers managed broadband services to over 30 educational and research institutions throughout the state. HEAnet received a total of £800,000 in aid for a project costing £1.7 million which involved the redesign and upgrade of its then existing network. Tralee Institute of Technology was among the educational-research institutes upgraded. Once again this project commenced in 1999 and was completed towards the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>The third project was undertaken by Eircom which invested in the deployment of broadband infrastructure in 75 locations along the west coast. The overall project cost was £10.6 million, of which grant aid comprised £4.5 million. This project commenced in 1999 and was completed in December 2000.</P>
    <P>An estimate of the total investment in broadband infrastructure in County Kerry as a result of these three projects is £2.2 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I am totally committed to the comprehensive utilisation by Ireland of leading edge data and information technologies, including satellite. I will <Col N="1123" /> continue to make this a priority. My Department is in the process of evaluating proposals for a pilot of VSAT technology. The purpose of this pilot scheme is to demonstrate the feasibility of using satellite technology in Ireland, particularly in remote areas at competitive costs.</P>
      <P>The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, with my consent, has recently made regulations providing for an important addition to the licensing structure for satellite services in Ireland. The new teleport facilities regulations will facilitate international telecommunications connectivity.</P>
      <P>Costs are a matter for commercial negotiation between the various operators and service providers. However, it is anticipated that the increasing availability of additional capacity will have a positive effect in this area.</P>
      <P>Ireland also participates in EUTELSAT, the European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, an intergovernmental body that operates a satellite network for fixed and mobile telecommunications. EUTELSAT was formed to provide international telecommunications links but is now increasingly involved in the provision of high bandwidth data services, which allows for rapid Internet access, and in the provision of broadcast services for both radio and television. I am presently preparing to bring proposals to Government to ratify, on behalf of Ireland, an amended EUTELSAT Convention. The proposed amendments will allow the organisation to develop its position in the fast growing markets for satellite communications services and to adapt to technical, economic and regulatory developments.</P>
      <P>Through its participation in both EUTELSAT and INTELSAT, its international equivalent, Ireland is well positioned to maximise the benefits that can be achieved from the expansion of satellite services. Undertakings in Ireland will have equal access to facilities as and when they are developed and become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for the companies which now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, <Col N="1124" /> put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas. These initiatives pick up on a number of the recommendations outlined in the e-Europe action plan.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, 26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide were supported and are no nearing completion.</P>
      <P>This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-06, to 200 million. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received I signed 12 contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of 200 million euros in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately 65 million.</P>

Following past bridge strikes the bridge was repaired and buttressed as necessary.</P>
    <P>I understand some further repairs are required to a wall on the approach to the railway bridge but these do not affect the railway interface. Iarnród Éireann has been in contact with Laois County Council regarding those repairs and a meeting has been arranged to discuss the construction of a robust impact barrier for the bridge</P>

      <P>My Department operates a sick pay scheme designed to protect employees to a certain extent against loss of earnings which may occur if they are unavoidably absent from work due to illness. It is a requirement of the scheme that all claims for payment of social welfare disability benefit must be forwarded, in the first instance, to my Department for onward transmission to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>In the case under reference, the employee concerned was removed from the benefits of the sick pay scheme, with effect from 22 November 2000, because of his repeated failure to comply with the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The question of restoring the benefits of the sick pay scheme to the employee concerned will be examined when he gives an undertaking, through his trade union if he wishes, to comply in future with the terms of the scheme and with the procedure for claiming sick pay entitlement.</P>

      <P>Ireland's approach to participation in PfP was set out in the Presentation Document of 1 December 1999, which was approved by this House. The Presentation Document included the five priority areas of co-operation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment and co-operation in marine matters.</P>
      <P>Ireland's objectives for participation in PfP include: to promote the development of a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to foster democratic control of armed forces internationally; to contribute to development of best practice in the areas of international peacekeeping and humanitarian operations; to enhance the capabilities of military officers, civil servants and diplomats engaged in the shaping and executing of security and defence policies; to enhance the capabilities, including the area of interoperability, of Ireland's Defence Forces for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates; to enhance the capabilities of Ireland's Defence Forces, Civil Defence and other relevant organisations to contribute to the areas of civil emergency planning; to share information and expertise particularly in the area of international peacekeeping, arms control, civil emergency planning, humanitarian operations, search and rescue, scientific and environmental issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from joining PfP, a programme for Ireland's participation has recently been agreed. This is Ireland's first Individual Partnership Programme, IPP, and therefore provides an initial presentation of Ireland's broad approach <Col N="1129" /> and planned activities. The IPP has been drawn up in the light of existing legislation and therefore no new legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>Details of the planned activities, which allow for adjustment based on policy development and the availability of financial and other resources, has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>As a primary function of PfP is to enable States to enhance their capacity to co-operate in peace support operations, I want to take this opportunity to re-state the Government's position which is that Ireland will approach each mission on a case by case basis and only participate in operations authorised by the UN in accordance with the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act (1954), the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act (1960) and the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993.</P>

      <P>The persons named entered the scheme of early retirement from farming in joint management. The regulation under which the scheme was introduced requires that the pension payable under the scheme must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension which becomes payable to either the applicant or their spouse-partner in a joint management situation. Participants in the scheme are required to notify my Department immediately such pensions are awarded so as to avoid overpayments.</P>
      <P>One of the persons named qualified for a national retirement pension from 9 April 1999 but my Department was not notified of this until May 2000. By that stage a substantial over payment had occurred. In order to comply with its obligations in respect of EU funds, my Department has no option but to recover the resulting overpayment from future payments due to this person. The early retirement pension, therefore, has had to be reduced by the amount of the national retirement pension and by an additional amount to recover the over payment.</P>

      <P>No increase is due in the rate of pension under the scheme of early retirement from farming which is fixed by the EU regulation under which the scheme was introduced. However, the person named is entitled to a compensation payment in respect of the reduction in pension during 2000 that arose from the introduction of the euro in January 1999. This compensation will be paid at the end of March 2001.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the current controls, which are necessary to minimise the risk of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, may be causing difficulties for certain sheep farmers.</P>
      <P>I regret, however, that it is not possible to pay an early instalment of the 2001 ewe premium, as the EU regulations governing the scheme do not permit me to do this. In addition, the retention period for the 2001 ewe premium has not yet been completed.</P>
      <P>Payments totalling £25 million under the final instalment of the 2000 ewe premium began last month. Furthermore, I would point out that market prices in recent weeks have been extremely strong for Irish sheep producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.</P>
      <P>The payments position in respect of the 2000 schemes is that some £654 million has already been paid under the various headage and premium schemes to date. This compares quite favourably with the position at the same time last year when £621 million had been paid. Since 1 January 2001, almost 352,000 cheques valued at over £163 million have issued to farmers under the various headage and premium schemes.</P>
      <P>The commencement dates for payments as set out in the protocol on direct payments in respect of the main headage and premium schemes are quite specific and my Department's performance in this regard is such that all targets have been met and indeed surpassed in some instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with protocol commitments, balancing payments under the 2000 suckler cow premium <Col N="1139" /> scheme commenced on 31 January 2001 and 94% of applicants were paid within two days. The present position is that 96% of applicants have been paid over £154 million under this scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the special beef premium scheme, balancing payments commenced on 7 February 2001 when the quota usage for the year of application was determined and 90% of January to November applications were paid within a few days. To date more than 97% of those applications have been paid. Balancing payments are continuing and December 2000 applications have now been paid their entitlements following completion of their retention periods. Overall, 97% of applications have attracted payments valued at almost £184 million under this scheme to date.</P>
    <P>The final instalment under the 2000 ewe premium scheme was paid on 16 February 2001 &ndash; the earliest possible date following publication of the regulation setting the rate on 13 February 2001. In fact, 97% of applicants under this scheme were paid their final instalment in one day and over £77.4 million has been paid to sheep producers under the 2000 ewe premium scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the 2000 slaughter premium scheme, balancing payments cannot commence until the quota usage for the year of application is determined. Balancing payments are expected to commence under this scheme and under the national envelope scheme in April 2001 when the quota usage is finalised. It should be noted that almost £32 million has been paid to beef producers under these schemes to date.</P>
    <P>Although no specific targets were set out in the protocol with regard to the headage schemes, nevertheless, payments commenced on 8 September 2000 and 96% of cattle headage-beef cow applicants and 94% of sheep headage applicants have been paid over £111 million. In addition, £0.616 million has been paid out under the 2000 goat and equine headage schemes.</P>
    <P>In line with the targets set out in the protocol, payments under the 2000 extensification scheme are expected to commence in June 2001 and will be finalised by 30 June in line with EU regulations. In this regard it is worth noting that not all farmers have returned their census forms despite having been issued with reminders to do so.</P>
    <P>The only outstanding balancing payments under the 2000 suckler cow premium and special beef premium schemes are query cases and payments will issue to those herdowners when the problems associated with their applications are resolved. It is my intention that payments under the various premium schemes will be completed in all eligible cases by 30 June 2001 in line with EU rules and protocol commitments.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 21 animals under the 2000 cattle headage scheme. At an inspection carried out on his herd on 25 October 2000, it was found that one animal had lost its ear tag and two animals had never been tagged. The person named was informed in writing on the day of inspection that the three animals were rejected for grants because of the missing tags, and that the grants on the remaining animals would be reduced.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to the person named on 20 February 2001 advising him that no grants would be paid on the animals without tags, and that the grants payable on the remaining animals would be subject to a reduced payment in accordance with clauses 13(a) and 20(a) of the conditions governing the scheme. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. As no reply has been received, processing of the application for 2000 cattle headage grants is being finalised, and payment of £380.61 will issue within the next seven days.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations, 1995 (S.I. No. 114 of 1995) lay down standards for the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing and give effect to Council Directive 93/119/EC of 22 December 1993. The regulations set out rules for the treatment of animals prior to death and for humane methods of slaughter and killing of animals in slaughterhouses and other locations such as farms in order to ensure that animals are spared avoidable pain and suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Animals being depopulated as a precautionary measure against foot and mouth disease must be slaughtered on-farm as the movement of these animals to a slaughterhouse while alive would exacerbate any risk that might exist of spreading the virus. Depopulation on-farm is carried out by licensed slaughter experts, using humane killers, under veterinary supervision and in accordance with the best veterinary advice. Welfare considerations, and particularly the rules set out in the regulations, would always be uppermost in the minds of those whose task it is to put down the animals. It is not practicable under conditions of on-farm depopulation to arrange out-of-sight <Col N="1143" /> slaughter in all cases. I have arranged for a copy of the regulations to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The person named has received the full payment to which he was <Col N="1146" /> entitled. The introduction of the euro in January 1999 caused a reduction of some 5% in payments under REPS. The Council of Ministers agreed to a three-year scheme of compensation for these reductions. Full compensation was paid in 2000 for reductions in payments during 1999. Compensation for reductions in payment during 2000 was at the rate of 75% and this compensation has now been paid. Arrangements for compensation for reductions in payment in 2001 have not yet been determined.</P>

      <P>The protocol on direct payments to farmers sets down time limits for the processing of REPS applications and for payment once the applications are accepted.

      <P>The person named declared a forage area of 14.5 hectares on his 2000 area aid application. This gave him a stocking density limit of 29 livestock units for which he could receive premium.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the person named applied for special beef premium on 27 first age animals representing 16.2 livestock units and 37 second age animals representing 24.6 livestock units. This amounted to 40.8 livestock units in total. He has been paid £4387.0, that is, up to his limit of 29 livestock units.</P>
      <P>Under the EU regulations governing the scheme, all animals applied on in excess of the applicant's stocking limit are deemed to have received the category of the premium for which they were submitted and may not be reapplied on for that same category. It is also a requirement that cattle identity cards-passports show the correct premium status of animals and, therefore, they were stamped and punched for the premium in respect of which they were submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person named entered the scheme of early retirement from farming in joint management with her husband. The regulation under which the scheme was introduced requires that the pension payable under the scheme must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension, which becomes payable to either the applicant or their spouse-partner in a joint management situation. Participants in the scheme are required to notify my Department immediately such pensions are awarded so as to avoid overpayments.</P>
      <P>This person's husband qualified for a national retirement pension from 1 December 2000. My Department had reminded her in September 2000 and December 2000 of her obligation to notify the Department of her husband's entitlement to the national retirement pension. A reply confirming the award of pension and the amount he was being paid was not received from the participant until the middle of January 2001 however, and by that time an overpayment had occurred. In order to comply with its obligations in respect of EU funds, my Department has no option but to recover the resulting overpayment from future payments due to this person. Her early retirement pension, therefore, has had to be reduced by the amount of the national retirement pension and by an additional amount to recover the overpayment. Though the overpayment had occurred over two months, by Department is recovering it over twelve months to minimise the effect on her income.</P>

      <P>Rates have never been levied on State-occupied property, that is, mainly property occupied by Government Departments and Offices, Garda stations, Army barracks, prisons, State-occupied harbours and canals occupied by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. However, a contribution was made to local authorities in lieu of rates from the 1870s until 1987. The contribution was then subsumed into the rates support grant, now the local government fund since 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Valuation Bill, 2000, does not propose to change the position on the rateability of State-occupied property. The Bill does, however, provide for the Commissioner of Valuation to value these properties in the first revaluation following enactment. This will allow for rates to be col<Col N="1160" /> lected in respect of these properties should Government decide in the future to pursue that course of action.</P>

    <P>Detailed monitoring or logging of the use of either the Internet or the Government Intranet <Col N="1163" /> by Members of either House of the Oireachtas, or indeed any member of staff of any agency connected to the central access infrastructure, would require specialist equipment and software which is not part of the infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Use of the centrally provided infrastructure by Departments and Offices is voluntary. It is intended to replace this infrastructure with a virtual private networking facility for the public service later this year.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, I made significant changes to the stamp duty regime on transfers of second-hand residential property arising from the recommendations of the third Bacon report into the housing market. The Act introduced a three-tiered stamp duty structure for first-time buyers, owner-occupiers other than first-time buyers and investors. I increased the exemption from stamp duty from £60,000 to £150,000 in the case of first-time buyers and for other owner-occupiers to £100,000 and reduced the stamp duty rates on transfers of residential property at the lower end of the market for first-time buyers and other owner-occupiers in excess of these thresholds. In particular, the revised regime is structured to facilitate those who are trying to buy their first home and who are faced with particular difficulties in the market. Many first time owner-occupier buyers are now either exempt from stamp duty or pay at a reduced rate. However, owner-occupiers who are not first-time buyers also benefit generally from the revised stamp duty rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> The Act also introduced a flat 9% stamp duty rate on all categories of investors buying new or second-hand residential property. In the light of developments in the housing market since last year, the Government decided to reduce the rate of stamp duty for investors in new property from this flat 9% and an amendment to this effect was introduced on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001, which applies to conveyances made on and from 27 February 2001. However, the investor rate for second-hand properties will remain at 9%. This change to the stamp duty regime will leave the investor rate unchanged in the second-hand market while reducing it somewhat for new property, thus providing a supply incentive in this area. Limiting the concession to new housing maintains the relative advantage of first-time purchasers in the second-hand market which accounts for two-thirds of first-time purchaser transactions.</P>
    <P>The following table outlines the stamp duty rates now applying to purchases of second-hand houses.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as at 12 March this year, 801 persons were affected by the increase to 9% in stamp duty on second homes and homes for investment purposes since its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of developments in the housing market since last summer, the Government decided to reduce the rate of stamp duty for investors in new residential property from a flat 9% and an amendment to this effect was introduced on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001. This change applies to conveyances made on and from 27 February 2001. However, the investor rate for second-hand properties will remain at 9%. This change to the stamp duty regime will leave the investor rate unchanged in the second-hand market while reducing it for new property, thus providing a supply incentive in this area. Limiting the concession to new housing maintains the relative advantage of first-time purchasers in the second-hand market which accounts for two thirds of first-time purchaser <Col N="1167" /> transactions. This stamp duty change will also increase the attractiveness of tax incentives for student accommodation, which are new build.</P>

      <P>Agreement has now been reached with the European Commission to allow the application of commercial and industrial incentives to the majority of projects under the town renewal scheme. Details of the new arrangements, which are tailored to meet the Commission's requirements on State aids, were announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government on 16 March 2001.</P>
      <P>Incentives will be available to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that is enterprises defined by the EU as having certain characteristics, including a staff of fewer than 250 employees with either an annual turnover not exceeding 40 million euro or an annual balance sheet totalling 27 million euro. In detail, the range of projects that have been cleared to proceed from 6 April 2001 following discussions with the European Commission are: all new build SME projects &ndash; such projects will be eligible for both commercial and industrial incentives; refurbishment projects in the following categories: SME projects where the expenditure incurred is below 800,000 euro, (£630,051) will qualify for the full range of commercial and industrial incentives; SME projects, which involve both expenditure on refurbishment and the provision of an extension where the cost of the extension is at least 25% of the market value of the existing building &ndash; this category will also qualify for commercial and industrial incentives; local retail SME projects, excluding mail order and financial services. Incentives for office and industrial development are therefore excluded under this category.</P>
      <P>Projects which qualify under any of the three refurbishment categories outlined above will be eligible under the scheme. Refurbishment projects which do not fall within these categories are the subject of ongoing discussions with the European Commission. In view of the delay in reaching agreement with the Commission on the commencement of the commercial and industrial element of the scheme, the termination date of the scheme has been extended from 31 March 2003 to 31 December 2003.</P>
      <P>Provision to allow the implementation of these arrangements has been included on Report Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001, which is being circulated in the Dáil today. The provision will also provide that capital allowances will not apply in respect of expenditure incurred, on or after 6 April 2001, on industrial and commercial premises in designated areas under this scheme, where any part of that expenditure is met by way of grant assistance from State bodies or elsewhere. This amendment is being made in order to ensure that the scheme complies with the European Commission's regional aid guidelines for the period to 2006 and similar amendments were made on Committee Stage in respect of the urban and rural renewal schemes.</P>

      <Quest>the plans the Government has to amend legislation or regulations to enable public servants having 40 years' pensionable service to retire with full pension rights without attaining the age of 60 years.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7948/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the minimum retirement age for the generality of public servants is 60 years. Claims for a reduction in that age have traditionally been rejected on a number of grounds, including (a) the cost of such a reduction, (b) the fact that 60 years has been the norm in the public service for well over a century, (c) that 65 years is the normal minimum retiring age in the private sector and (d) that the trend in European administrations is to increase rather than reduce retiring ages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, all aspects of public service pensions, including retirement age, were considered by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. The report of the commission was published on 31 January 2001. While the commission did not recommend any reduction in the retirement age, it did make some recommendations regarding retirement before the age of 60 years in particular circumstances. Among its recommendations were (i) the introduction of cost neutral early retirement for public servants aged 50 years and over; (ii) the introduction of retirement provisions which would be available at an individual-group level to cater for organisational restructurings, reductions in staff numbers and as part of new performance management systems to be introduced in the public service and (iii) a scheme of approved early retirement which could be avail<Col N="1170" /> able to serving public servants aged 55 years or over with 20 years or more service, who feel that they are unable to make a fully satisfactory contribution and where management accepts that their early retirement would improve the general level of efficiency and effectiveness in the service in question.</P>
    <P>As indicated at the time of publication, the Government intends to make formal decisions on the commission's recommendations once it has had an opportunity to consider the report in detail. I am of the view that the commission's recommendations represent an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the package of measures as a whole. I expect that this element will be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a working group of the public service unions, relevant Government Departments and other appropriate bodies is to be established following Government consideration of the report of the commission to advise on the implementation of the relevant Government decisions with a view to introducing, as quickly as possible, any proposed changes in public service pension arrangements, including those for low paid workers. As indicated at the time of publication of the report, the Government will move to establish that working group when it has made its decisions on the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, provide a range of tax reliefs for qualifying disabled persons. A qualifying person is entitled to relief from vehicle registration tax and VAT of up to a maximum of £7,500 in respect of the acquisition of a motor vehicle. In the case of a vehicle acquired for a disabled passenger, relief of up to £12,500 is available. This relief may be claimed every two years.</P>
      <P>In addition, a qualifying person may claim relief from the excise duty on the fuel used in a qualifying vehicle for the transportation of the disabled person concerned, up to a limit of 600 gallons per annum. At current rates of excise duty, this would amount to relief of approximately £750 per annum on 600 gallons of unleaded petrol and approximately £536 on 600 gallons of diesel. Qualifying persons are also entitled to exemption from annual road tax.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the relief a &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; is one who: (i) is under 35 years of age at the date of execution of the transfer; (ii) is the holder of one of the  specified qualifications, for example, the Teagasc certificate in farming; or (iii) if born before 1 January 1968, has three years' experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc training courses in agriculture and horticulture of 180 hours duration.</P>
      <P>Where the transferee has completed at least one academic year of the Teagasc certificate in farming at the date of execution of the transfer, he or she may obtain the relief by way of a refund provided that the qualification is obtained within three years of the date of execution of the transfer. This is a very generous relief as it currently stands and cannot be availed of by any other sector. I have no plans to make any amendments to the current legislation as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the VAT charge on the installation and operation of security systems, EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, requires that VAT apply to the supply of these goods and services regardless of the status of the user of the service. It is not, therefore, open to me to remove VAT from the installation or maintenance charges for alarms for senior citizens. There is, however, the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order, 1981, administered by the Revenue Commissioners, which provides for refunds of VAT in respect of certain goods for use by disabled people. Under this order, it is possible to obtain a refund of VAT on the purchase of personal alarms by or on behalf of a disabled or elderly person, normally used as medical alert systems and which are triggered by a pendant worn by the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs operates a scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable elderly people in the community. This scheme was established in 1996 on foot of the recommendations of the task force on security for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme, grants may be provided through voluntary organisations dealing with the elderly for small scale physical equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window <Col N="1173" /> locks, door chains and locks, security lighting and socially monitored alarm systems. Funding is not provided for conventional burglar-intruder alarms. The amount of funding provided for under the scheme since its inception is £22 million, to end 2000, and it has assisted some 80,842 individuals.</P>
    <P>Given the measures available under the relevant refund order and the community support scheme, I am of the view that significant efforts are being made to enhance the security of older people.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, that they have not received an application for the tax relief from the person concerned. It is a fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme that the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations governing the scheme, and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of the certificate is refused, this may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>I understand that the issue of a primary medical certificate was refused in this case and that this refusal was appealed to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal. The person concerned was examined by the board on 27 October 1999 and was found not to meet the specified medical criteria at that time. It is regretted that an application under the scheme cannot be considered without the issue of a primary medical certificate. It is open to any person to reapply for the certificate to the appropriate senior area medical officer, especially where it is felt that the medical criteria for the relief may now be met.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 294 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An adequate and varied diet can, under normal circumstances, provide all necessary nutrients for normal development and maintenance of a healthy life. However, surveys show that this ideal situation is not being achieved for all nutrients and by all groups of the population. The recently launched North-South Ireland food con<Col N="1176" /> sumption survey showed inadequate intakes of calcium, iron, vitamin D and folate in certain subgroups of the population. In particular, findings showed that few women of reproductive age achieved the folate intake recommended for the prevention of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida in newborn infants and all those who met the recommended intake were using folic acid supplements.</P>
    <P>Fortified foods could contribute to a considerable extent towards an adequate intake of nutrients. There are no specific national provisions with respect to fortification of foods in Ireland. However, only food fit for human consumption may be made available and offered for sale to the public.</P>
    <P>Food fortification is a generic term for the addition of nutrients to foods and it is generally accepted that it takes a number of forms: (a) Food restoration: the term &ldquo;restoration&rdquo; describes the replacement, either fully or partially, of nutrients lost during some stage of food production or distribution, for example, vitamins A and D in low fat milk and vitamin C in fruit juices; (b) Food fortification-enrichment: the term &ldquo;fortification&rdquo; describes the addition of nutrients to a food to levels above those normally present in that food. In some cases, nutrients that are not naturally present in a particular food may be added to that food. The <i>Codex Alimentarius</i> defines fortification and-or enrichment as &ldquo;the addition of one or more essential nutrients to a food whether or not it is normally contained in the food for the purpose of preventing or correcting a demonstrated deficiency of one or more essential nutrients in the population group&rdquo;; (c) Substitution: this means adding one or more nutrients to a food which is intended as a substitute for another food in the diet. For example vitamins A and D are added to margarine which was developed as a substitute for butter.</P>
    <P>Foods most commonly fortified include breakfast cereals, fruit juices, low fat milks and milk powders, low calorie soups, slimming, dietetic and baby foods.</P>
    <P>Nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals and others, probiotic bacteria, components of &ldquo;dietary fibre&rdquo;, for example, inulin or oligofructose, and fish oils, are added to foods voluntarily by food manufacturers or are required to be added as provided by specific national or Community legislation for example, infant formula and follow on formula, foods intended for use in energy restricted diets.</P>
    <P>In order to test for compliance with general food labelling requirements, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, in collaboration with the environmental health services and the public analyst laboratories of the health boards, has incorporated the monitoring of vitamins and minerals in fortified foods, including breakfast cereals, milk, soft drinks, etc., in this year's national food sampling programme.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some member states require the mandatory addition of some vitamins and <Col N="1177" /> minerals to certain ordinary foods, for reasons dictated by public health considerations, such as the addition of vitamins A and D to margarine, or the addition of iodine to salt.</P>
    <P>I understand that differing national rules may impede the free movement of these products within the EU. The absence of EU wide regulations may also create unequal conditions of competition and thus have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market.</P>
    <P>In view of the above, the Commission, in its White Paper on food safety, has committed itself to bringing forward a proposal for a directive on fortified food, which will lay down provisions for marketing foods to which nutrients such as vitamins and minerals have been added. This directive will serve to protect consumers' health and to facilitate intra-Community trade in such products. It is likely that this directive will, as a first stage, lay down a positive list of vitamins and minerals which may be added to food. I look forward to participating in discussions at EU level with a view to introducing this directive on nutrients that may be added to food to fruition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The area of children's rights is a complex one. Both historically and constitutionally, the family has been the unit of society which received special protection, and children's rights have been taken into account within this unit. The Constitution Review Group in its report published in 1996 made a number of recommendations in this area. The all-party committee on the Constitution is currently considering the report of the Constitution Review Group and this committee has been requested, on behalf of the Government, to prioritise its consideration of the issue of the constitutional underpinning of individual children's rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, there have been substantial developments in the area of strengthening children's rights in Ireland in recent years. One of the most significant developments was the launch last year of the Government's national children's strategy. The national children's strategy is the single biggest initiative during the 1990s to further progress the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland ratified in 1992. The goals and objectives set out in the national children's strategy have been set in the context of supporting the implementation of children's rights. Under the strategy, <Col N="1178" /> it is proposed to establish an office of ombudsman for children as an independent office. The ombudsman for children will, <i>inter alia</i>, be responsible for promoting the welfare and rights of children generally and advising the Government on issues of importance to children.</P>
    <P>There have also been important legislative developments in Ireland, which strengthen and protect children's rights in key areas. The most notable have been the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Child Care Act, 1991, the Children Act, 1997, and the Children Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the light of the above, and pending the outcome of the all-party committee's deliberations, I have no plans to introduce a children's rights Bill.</P>

      <P>The details requested by the Deputy regarding confectionary consumption habits of other EU countries are not available. With regard to confectionary consumption habits of Irish people, the survey of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition, SLÁN, and the Irish health behaviour in school aged children, HBSC, survey provide data on the general eating habits of the population. These results, from 1998, defined confectionery as chocolate, sweets, toffees, mints, and sugar added to drinks. The mean intake in grams per day for various groups is: Overall Average 28.47 grams per day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be <Col N="1181" /> entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax, VRT and VAT, to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is the driver, and £12,500 if the qualifying person is a passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of excise duty on up to 600 gallons of fuel and an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme cost some £22 million in 2000, excluding the annual road tax costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support for severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport, and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April, and it has been envisaged that from that date persons <Col N="1183" /> who benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme would be unable to also avail of mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme have access to transport, which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, has given further consideration to this proposal in the light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals, and it has now been decided that while the increased rate of £90 per month will, as intended, be given only to people who are not also enjoying the tax concessions, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing maximum rate of £45.60 per month.</P>

This suggestion is one of a number of proposals made by the author of the review. As the review is still in draft form, it would be inappropriate for further comment to be made without the full findings and recommendations of the review being available for consideration.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Mid-Western Health Board that the board has a long-established link with the Neuroscience Centre, University College Hospital Cork, for the provision of neurological services on a sessional basis.</P>
      <P>From a national perspective, I have asked Comhairle na nOspidéal to initiate a review of neurology services which will focus on updating their 1991 report into neurology services, taking into account the following: various papers published since the 1991 Comhairle na nOspidéal review on the development of neurology services; recent advances in the provision of services; and an increasing demand for a structured approach to post-operative care and rehabilitation. The review will assist me in relation to decisions on the positioning of neurology in the expansion of acute hospital services and a potentially significant expansion in the numbers of consultant posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, provide a system for regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria. The regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. They regulate the granting of contracts with a view to (1) bringing Ireland into line with other EU/EEA states where such <Col N="1195" /> controls exist in one form or another, (2) improving standards in existing pharmacies and (3) promoting patient access to pharmacy services in rural areas. Because of the absence of any controls in regard to the granting of contracts, Ireland has been compelled to continue a derogation from the free movement of pharmacists directive.</P>
      <P>The regulations came into force in tandem with the introduction of a new contract for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which is pro-active in promoting a quality-driven service to the patient. I have no doubt that the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement, which imposes obligations that were not in place before. A central and innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost-effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. The contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
      <P>Because of public health considerations, pharmacy services and the licensing and supply of pharmaceutical products is one of the most heavily regulated services in the world. I am satisfied that an unregulated system, in addition to being out of step with arrangements elsewhere in Europe, would lead to a diminution of the quality of professional community pharmacy services. I had a meeting recently with officials of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, during which, <i>inter alia</i>, the current regulations were discussed. There was general agreement that the time was opportune to review the operation of the regulations to see if they had fully achieved the desired effects, and this will be undertaken as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>The appropriate balance to be struck between public safety considerations and the general desire to remove any unnecessary obstacles to competition will be considered in the context of the review.</P>

These recommendations include: that the content of advertising should not create the impression that alcohol drinking contributes to social and sexual success; that the placement of alcohol advertising should not be permitted in the media where more than 25% of the audience is underage; that those who promote or advertise alcohol on line should provide mechanisms for parents to prevent their children gaining access to that advertising; that advertisers of alcohol should avoid content that is attractive to underage customers and that they should post educational messages about responsible drinking.</P>

      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran report &ndash; review of orthodontic services &ndash; structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. As a result, funds of £5.3 million have been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients.</P>
      <P>Based on the health boards' own submissions, I expect that this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The health boards have advised that the ultimate effect will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out.</P>
      <P>The most recent information on orthodontic waiting lists received by my Department on 8 March is as follows:</P>

      <P>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy concerned the cost of individual items of drugs-medicines being reflected on receipts issued by community pharmacies under the drugs payment scheme. On receipt of each original form from the community pharmacy, the total value of dispensed items is automatically calculated by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board. The gross cost of drugs-medicines dispensed to the named individual, or family in a calendar month is established and this value, less £42 already paid by the patient, is the amount paid by the board to the community pharmacist. The board's interest is in having data captured accurately so that payments and statistics reflect the true outcome of business arrangements between community pharmacies and their customers. This matter is, in the first instance, a matter between pharmacies and their system suppliers. However, my Department recognises the interest of the person concerned in having the cost of each of the drugs/medicine items being shown on the receipt and has arranged to have the matter brought to the attention of the relevant parties.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons in County Wicklow is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA).</P>
      <P>This year, the ERHA received an additional investment of £2.34 million for orthodontic services, of which £1.61 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The authority is recruiting additional staff and developing a five-surgery unit at St. James's Hospital and a six-surgery facility at the Loughlinstown Hospital Regional Orthodontic Unit. Three additional consultant orthodontists are being recruited; the appointments to two of these posts are in train and the recruitment process for the third post is under way.</P>
      <P>This initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The authority has advised that the initiative will enable an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list to be treated and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 360, 362 to 366, inclusive, 368 and 383 to 385, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following my announcement in December, 2000 in relation to the recent issue involving Medeva oral polio vaccine used in Ireland which contained human serum albumin produced from a plasma pool, where one of the donors had recently been diagnosed as having the variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), health boards were requested to have immunisation records examined in order to establish the extent of usage of the vaccine batches concerned. In the course of this examination information came to light which suggests that vaccine from the batches concerned was administered after its expiry date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I requested expert advice in relation to the safety and efficacy aspects of this issue from the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee has advised that the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced if it is administered more than one month after the expiry date and that the vaccination should therefore be repeated in such cases. My Department has written to the chief executive <Col N="1206" /> officers of the health boards advising them that parents of any children who received any dose of oral polio vaccine more than one month after its expiry date should be contacted and advised of the need to have the immunisation repeated. The health boards were asked to advise general practitioners and all other relevant health professionals of the situation.</P>
    <P>The health boards were requested to conduct a detailed examination of records in order to establish the extent to which the administration of oral polio vaccine after its expiry date had occurred in the period from January 1998 to December 2000. The information to date, which is not yet complete, suggests that in excess of 11,000 doses were administered out of date and that, of this quantity, approximately 5,000 doses were administered more than one month after their expiry date. It should, however, be noted that in any one-year period, some 100,000 children receive approximately 200,000 doses of oral polio vaccine as part of the primary and booster childhood immunisation programmes.</P>
    <P>In view of the level of administration of oral polio vaccine after its expiry date, my Department has requested that health boards establish if children were given out-of-date vaccine. All records from 8 December 1995 (the date of the changeover to the GP delivery system) should be examined and health boards have also been asked to satisfy themselves that all vaccines (primary and booster) administered before this date (by health boards and general practitioners) were administered prior to the expiry date of the product concerned.</P>
    <P>Health boards have also been asked to take appropriate measures in respect of vaccines administered from this point forward to ensure the validation of all key information i.e. patient name, batch number and expiry date by cross reference to registration and supply databases.</P>
    <P>In addition, health boards have been requested to ask their primary care units, where there is no confusion about out-of-date information on the packages, to examine how the administration of out-of-date vaccines occurred and the measures which should be put in place to prevent a recurrence. This matter has also been brought to the attention of the Irish College of General Practitioners, which have been asked to review the matter and to consider the development of protocols in respect of vaccine administration.</P>
    <P>This incident highlighted a number of issues in relation to the management and delivery of vaccines and in particular vaccines under the childhood immunisation programme. In view of this, health boards have been asked to examine systems and procedures currently in place, identify shortcomings where these exist and put in place revised systems/procedures as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In addition, as a result of my concern about the issuing of vaccine after its expiry date, I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards to establish a national immunisation steer<Col N="1207" /> ing committee, which is addressing a wide range of issues relating to the primary childhood immunisation programme. This will include consideration of the protocols for administration of vaccines, whether new mechanisms need to be developed to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date and to <Col N="1208" /> ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out the number of oral polio vaccine doses, based on the latest information obtained from the health boards, which were administered after the expiry date. This information is provisional and may be subject to revision as further information is provided.</P>

    <P>The health boards have confirmed that they have provided, or are in the process of providing, lists of children who received vaccine more than one month after its expiry date to general practitioners in their area. General practitioners have been asked to validate these lists against their own records and recall children as appropriate for revaccination.</P>
    <P>Based on data held by health boards, they have indicated that there is no evidence to suggest that oral polio vaccine was distributed to GPs after its expiry date. However, due to the short shelf life of some vaccine, the product was, in some instances, delivered close to its expiry date.</P>
    <P>The responses from the health boards on the number of instances where, during health board investigations, the boards were unable to trace the administration of out of date vaccine due to incomplete vaccination records require further clarification and the information will be furnished to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The following table indicates the Medeva/Evans and Smithkline Beecham batch numbers, which have been notified to date, that were administered after the expiry date.</P>

    <P>This information may be subject to revision as further records are examined. The other health boards were unable to provide the information requested in the time available. I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it is received.</P>
    <P>The Department is involved in ongoing communication with the Irish Medicines Board regarding the labelling of vaccine-expiry-date issues. The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that it is investigating issues relating to expiry date practice and will report once these investigations have been completed. The board has also indicated that it intends to re-emphasise the responsibilities of authorisation holders, in their next newsletter and on their website, in relation to setting expiry dates. These requirements are already established in good manufacturing practice and other guidelines. The expiry date when expressed as a month-year is generally accepted to indicate that the product in question may be used until the last day of that month.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that a significant amount of oral polio vaccine was issued after its expiry date during the period from January 1998 to December 2000. This only came to light as a result of my announcement in December 2000 relating to oral polio vaccine administered during this period which contained human serum albumin produced from a plasma pool where one of the donors had recently been diagnosed as having the variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The situation by which vaccines are administered <Col N="1209" /><Col N="1210" /> after the expiry date is far from acceptable and that is why I, along with relevant agencies, have taken the range of measures necessary to ensure a comprehensive examination of the administration of the primary immunisation programme.</P>

No. 1374 of Dáil Debates on 20 February 2001 &ndash; the expert review group have indicated that they anticipate that their work will be completed in a number of months. Because of the importance and the complexity of the work, it is not possible to give an exact date for completion but I have been assured that the group is working as expeditiously as possible and that there is no undue delay in the work of the group. I am looking forward to receiving the report, which I will consider in due course.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the study referred to by the Deputy. This was a relatively small scale pilot study on medical error conducted by staff at University College Hospital Trust in London. The error rate found by the study is consistent with that established in other larger studies conducted elsewhere, such as the Harvard Medical Malpractice Study. No such study has been conducted in this country. The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a central incident database is an important element of the proposed enterprise liability scheme. The community warden service will be piloted in the five following local authorities: Galway, Leitrim and Wexford county councils, Galway Corporation and Naas UDC.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The granting of a medical card to individuals is solely a matter, under the Health Act, 1970, for the chief executive officer. Accordingly, I have referred the matter to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 372, 375 and 378 together.</P>
      <P>Changes for the reform of the advisory committees structure under the Simpler Legislation in the Internal Market Initiative have been proposed. The Advisory Committee on Medical Training, which is still in existence, is included in these proposals. While changes have been proposed for some time, the Commission has been, as part of a wider review, developing a Communication on New European Labour Markets. Further to this review the Commission will launch a consultation procedure which will take place from May to October 2001.</P>
      <P>Reforms proposed for the Advisory Committee on Medical Training are viewed by the Medical Council with concern. It is the view of the Medical Council that acceptance of these proposals would mean that the competent authorities for the regulation of medicine in the EU would have no means to address issues such as training, standards of quality or regulatory mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Ireland has already made its objections to the original proposals known. It is intended to present further views on the regulation of professions and on how the Advisory Committee of Medical Training can be restructured without diluting its effectiveness.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is working on the introduction of enterprise liability as the future basis for indemnifying hospitals and doctors against the cost of claims for compen<Col N="1213" /> sation arising from malpractice or negligence. I am also in the process of establishing a group to examine the possibility of introducing a needs based &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme for infants who suffer brain damage at, or close to, the time of birth. Both of those initiatives have the potential to stabilise the cost of providing indemnity cover for obstetricians. The cost of this cover is directly related to the size of awards and settlements made in respect of brain-damaged babies. Under the existing indemnity arrangements these costs are met by the medical defence organisation which represent consultant obstetricians in those cases. The bulk of this cost is met by the Exchequer in respect of obstetricians employed in the public hospital system. However, the setting of an appropriate subscription rate to fund these costs is a matter for the medical defence organisations.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the delivery of speech and language therapy services in the Kilkenny area is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The board currently provides one session of speech and language therapy to the school in question per fortnight. This session is provided to the most junior class in the school as it has been prioritised by the speech and language therapy services as being in most need of these services. The board has approved funding for a post of senior speech and language therapist, to be filled in 2001. This will enable the board to increase the sessional input to the school to five sessions per week. When this appointment is made, the needs of the remaining children in the school will be reviewed by the speech and language therapists and recommendations will be made in relation to their individual requirements.</P>

Doctors are now receiving computerised registration certificates.

      <P>The objectives of the health response to the drug problem are based on two key elements, reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which is a return to a drug free lifestyle.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department is responsible for the delivery of drug awareness messages to the public in general and to specific target groups and for the development, in conjunction with the health boards and the Department of Education and Science, of education and prevention programmes for schools. It is also responsible for developing and implementing policy for the provision of drug treatment services. These services are delivered by the ten health boards and include detoxification, maintenance programmes, counselling and rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Another dimension to my Department's role is ensuring that proper controls are in place in relation to possession, import and control of all controlled drugs in accordance with the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. A principal officer from my Department chairs the national drug strategy team which oversees the work of the local drug task forces.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of drug abuse it is difficult to establish the extent of the problem. Various estimates have been made which range from 7,500 to 13,500 heroin users in the greater Dublin area. The National Advisory Committee on Drugs, which is under the aegis of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, will, as part of its remit, examine trends in drug use.</P>

      <P>It is not my policy nor is it the policy of any health board to supply cigarettes to long stay patients in elderly or psychiatric hospitals. Long stay patients in such hospitals may purchase cigarettes from their own resources. In some instances, hospital <Col N="1218" /> management may purchase cigarettes for long stay patients who have no means of their own and for whom the total withdrawal of cigarettes would be counter-productive to their mental well being.</P>
      <P>There are no written guidelines concerning the supply of cigarettes to psychiatric patients. However, I have asked the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to review this and to issue guidelines to health boards on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 390 and 396 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme and the findings of the report are being fully considered in my Department. It is the intention of <Col N="1219" /> my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
    <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
    <P>It has also been decided that payments should be made to those who were adversely affected by the provision in the regulations which allowed for the assessment of circumstances of adult sons and daughters and which was removed with effect from 1 January 1999. A group representing my Department and the health boards Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established and is putting in place procedures to ensure that moneys will be paid in a uniform manner as quickly as possible to those whose subvention was unfavourably affected by this regulation. It is expected that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>However, as the Deputy will appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving,<i> inter alia,</i> difficult issues of traceability and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible. In the particular case referred to by the Deputies, I have asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to investigate the matter and reply directly.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for the provision of speech and language therapy services are a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am aware that, while there has been a significant level of investment in recent years in health related support services, including speech and language therapy services, for both pre-school and children of school going age with intellectual disability, autism, physical and sensory disabilities, the health boards and non-statu<Col N="1220" /> tory agencies are experiencing difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals required to deliver these services. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to take a flexible approach in using the resources which have been allocated to the services, including the possibility of the purchase of additional sessions, with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services.</P>
    <P>My Department has also engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including speech and language therapists and I am expecting their final report shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nursing Homes, Subvention, Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. However, it is the intention to increase the rates by 25% to £90, £120 and £150 from 1 April next.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. I understand from information received from the health boards/health authority that enhanced subventions are paid is some cases in each board/authority area. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>

      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that my colleague, Deputy Hanafin, Minister of State at my Department, announced in July 2000 approval to a grant of £5 million for the upgrading of facilities at St. Columcille's Hospital. This development will include an extension to the existing accident and emergency department. A project team is in place to oversee this work.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that endocrine disrupting chemicals possess the characteristic ability to alter hormone or endocrine systems. Known or suspected endocrine disrupters include industrial chemicals like dioxins and PCBs, organo-chlorine pesticides and a number of now banned pesticides such as DDT <Col N="1222" /> and chlordane and certain other synthetic chemicals.</P>
      <P>EU directives in the area of industrial chemical safety and subsequent national legislation and regulations are implemented and monitored by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Health and Safety Authority. The Environmental Protection Agency has also carried out some work in this area particularly in relation to the effects on the reproduction of wildlife populations and suggests the main risk from endocrine disrupters as likely to arise through dispersal from products such as pesticides rather than industrial discharges. The pesticides control unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development monitors the use of pesticides in the agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>The EU is currently reviewing its chemicals policy in this area and several substances identified as endocrine disrupters are under review. I would be concerned over a possible link to human disorders, including cancers, with these chemicals. The National Cancer Registry Board identifies, collects, classifies and analyses information relating to the incidence and prevalence of cancer and related tumours in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitution of Comhairle na nOspideál is governed by the Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1970. These regulations provide for a membership of 27, including not fewer than 14 persons who are registered medical practitioners engaged in a consultant capacity in the provision of hospital services. The regulations also stipulate that all persons appointed to the comhairle shall be selected for appointment by the Minister for Health. It has been the practice over the years for each Minister to consult with a number of bodies prior to making the final decision on the appointments to the board.</P>
      <P>Recently, when I was making appointments to the new comhairle, I consulted with a range of bodies including all of the health boards, voluntary hospitals and other major organisations including trade unions. As a result, I received a large number of nominations for appointment to the board. Given the statutory limit on the total number of members, it was not possible to appoint representatives from every hospital to comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making the appointments, I had full regard to the need to achieve a wide geographical spread, the value of representing a large number <Col N="1223" /> of consultant specialties and the need to ensure an appropriate gender balance. In these circumstances, it was not possible to appoint a representative from Tallaght Hospital on this occasion but I can assure the Deputy that the new comhairle has been carefully structured to represent the views of all sectors across the health services.</P>

The wardens will also report suspected breaches of technical regulations such as waste disposal, planning, etc., and also report suspicious or criminal activity to the Garda. It is also envisaged that the service will play a role in tourist advice and assistance and generally promote a positive image of the local authority among both the local community and visitors alike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall Government policy on waste management is committed to a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which will deliver ambitious recovery and recycling targets over a 15 year period. These <Col N="1226" /> include diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill; a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill; the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum and recycling of 35% of municipal waste.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these targets, current and proposed local and regional waste management plans incorporate proposals for: household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas; an extended network of bring facilities in rural areas, typically with a target density of one facility per 500 population; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities; and support for home composting of food and garden waste, especially in rural areas.</P>
      <P>It is implicit in these proposed plans that a considerable improvement is required in the way waste is dealt with in Ireland, to deliver a much higher recycling performance, recover energy from waste which cannot be recycled, and use landfill as a last resort for residual wastes which cannot otherwise be recovered. In effect, the plans are designed to secure an integrated approach to the management of waste.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 anticipates capital investment of at least £650 million in the development of waste management infrastructure. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer-EU funding is being provided to support the development of requisite waste recycling and recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan.</P>
      <P>I intend shortly to publish a policy statement on waste prevention and recovery. This will address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of policy objectives and targets in this area, and will outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in support of a better national recycling performance. These measures will encompass proposals in relation to waste prevention and minimisation, market development for recyclables, and the provision of further reprocessing capacity for recyclable materials.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to established bring facilities and civic amenity sites is set out in the national waste database report for 1998 which was published by the Environmental Protection Agency last year, and which is available in the Oireachtas Library. I understand that, overall, the national network of bring facilities has increased to over 1,000 sites, while 40 civic amenity sites are now in operation nationwide.</P>
      <P>My Department has reviewed waste management practice in a number of countries. Within the European Union, I understand that only Ireland and Greece do not utilise energy recovery which is classified as a recovery rather than a disposal activity as an element of their integrated waste management infrastructure.</P>

      <P>The standard speed limit for built up urban areas is currently 30 miles per hour. In addition, there is a general obligation that a vehicle shall not be driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable its driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, indicated that changes to speed limit regimes, which were comprehensively 'reviewed' some years ago, were not proposed in the immediate term; the priority must instead be to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.</P>
      <P>However, the option of revising speed limits downwards is not ruled out if enforcement of existing limits does not show good progress towards the strategy goal of reducing present excessive levels of speeding. Such downward revisions could address lower speed limits, such as 20 miles per hour, in built up areas. Adequate legislative provisions are already in place in section 46 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as substituted by section 33 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, if required, to support this approach.</P>
      <P>Existing legislative provisions, in particular section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, empower road authorities, in the interest of the safety and convenience of road users, to provide such traffic calming measures as they consider desirable in respect of public roads in their charge, subject to the consent of the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 408, 424 and 429 together.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of bus lanes and quality bus corridors is to facilitate mass transport in urban areas. Accordingly, access to bus lanes has been restricted to omnibuses, large public service vehicles and, in relation to with flow bus lanes only, taxis and pedal cycles.</P>
      <P>The view has been taken that access to bus lanes by motorcyclists is not necessitated on road safety grounds and could indeed compromise the safe cycling environment for pedal cyclists which bus lanes and quality bus corridors aim to provide. As indicated in my response to a Dáil Adjournment motion on 26 October 2000, it is understood from the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, that several pilot schemes-studies regarding the use of bus lanes by motor cycles have been conducted in the United Kingdom. The experience of these studies has not yet resulted in any alteration of the general position in the UK whereby motorcycles are not permitted to use bus lanes.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for considering the feasibility of pilot tests in this country, to which I referred in a Dáil debate of 26 October 2000, are being addressed in consultation with the Dublin Transportation Office and other relevant bodies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 412 and 413 together.</P>
      <P>The relevant regulations require lamps that show a light to the front of a vehicle to be fitted and constructed so that they will not dazzle or mislead other traffic when lit. In addition, such lamps must be fitted with a dipping device so that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp and in a specified position, which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. Exceptions to the dipping device requirement are made for direction indicators and for one or more other lamps with a combined maximum power output of seven watts. Dipped headlamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. The use of fog lamps is permitted only in fog or falling snow. Within this framework a maximum power rating is not specified for vehicle lights. The Garda has responsibility for enforcement of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Checks on headlamp condition and alignment are carried out as part of both the national car test and commercial vehicle testing scheme. Standards for lighting for new vehicles are set out in EU type approval law. These standards have <Col N="1231" /> been adopted at EU level following extensive consultation with vehicle and lighting manufacturing interests and member states. They have been incorporated into the whole vehicle type approval framework for cars, which applies on a mandatory basis in all member states. All new cars sold in Ireland are required to meet the standards which are also deemed to comply with vehicle lighting law.</P>
    <P>The European Commission, in consultation with vehicle and lighting manufacturers, is developing proposals to extend the whole vehicle type approval scheme, including lighting standards, on a mandatory basis to all categories of road going vehicles. These requirements will be transposed into law when the relevant directives have been adopted.</P>

      <P>I am considering carefully when to restore the requirement to present an NCT certificate on renewal of the motor tax for a car that is liable for the test at the renewal date. It will be necessary in this context to ensure that owners will have had adequate opportunity to present cars for test before the link again becomes mandatory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being encountered by An Bord Pleanála in meeting the four month deadline due to the ongoing increase in appeals. To date in 2001 the intake of cases is 3% higher than in 2000. In view of the pressures on the housing market and the Government's policy objective to increase housing supply, the board now accords priority status to housing developments in excess of 30 units. As at end February 2001 the percentage of such cases decided within the statutory period in the year to date is 86% with the average time taken to decide these cases being 15.8 weeks as against 23.6 weeks for all appeals.</P>
      <P>My Department and the board have been discussing on an ongoing basis a range of measures to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously. The number of board members was increased from six to ten. I approved all staffing proposals submitted by the board in 1998 and 1999. In July of last year I approved an increase of 29 additional staff  &ndash; nine professional planners and 20 administrative staff &ndash; which brought the board's authorised staffing complement to 134. Recruitment of these additional staff is ongoing.</P>
      <P>A variety of measures are being taken to increase the availability of professional planners both to the local authorities and the board. My Department is involved in the FÁS Jobs Ireland campaign to secure planners from abroad. The Department, local authorities and An Bord Pleanála attended the FÁS jobs fair in London in December. This is the first in a series of jobs fairs where the appointment to both local authorities and the board of planners is being pursued. In addition, general details of the opportunities in the local authorities and the board for planners have been included on the FÁS Jobs Ireland website. I am also aware of plans by the board to engage private planning consultants to assist in dealing with the large number of appeals on hand.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, is being implemented; and if he will outline situations where developments have been undertaken where a specified percentage of residential development of land or houses has been allocated for social and affordable housing.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 27 of 22 February 2001, Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, was commenced with effect from 1 November last. In accordance with section 94 of the Act, planning authorities have until the end of July this year to prepare their housing strategies and a further three months thereafter to vary their development plans to incorporate their housing strategies. Planning authorities have been urged to complete this process as soon as possible so that they can operate the social and affordable housing provisions at the earliest date.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for planning authorities on the preparation of housing strategies along with a model housing strategy were issued by my Department last December and regional seminars were held in January. Each housing strategy must identify the overall need for housing within the area covered by the strategy, including the need for social and affordable housing. Planning authorities will be able to reserve up to 20% of land zoned in the development plan for residential use, or for a mix of residential and other uses, to meet the identified needs for social and affordable housing. The percentage of land to be reserved can be made available to the planning authority at existing use value. The housing strategy should also provide for an appropriate mix of dwelling types and sizes to cater for the range of housing needs identified including, for example, first time buyers, the elderly and special needs housing. The provisions of Part V relating to the reservation of residentially zoned land for social and affordable housing will only apply to planning permissions granted after a planning authority incorporates their housing strategy into the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> Prior to the commencement of Part V a number of local authorities had already included in their development plans objectives to secure a specified percentage in all new residential developments for social housing. For example, I understand that Fingal County Council has reached agreements with a number of developers as a result of this for the provision of social and affordable housing units. I am also aware that some local authorities have entered into arrangements with developers for the development of lands in the ownership of the local authorities for a mix of private, social and affordable housing. In this regard, Fingal County Council has recently awarded a contract for the development of a 40 acre site in their ownership for about 700 units of private, social and affordable housing. This type of approach is also being used by Dublin Corporation in Cherry Orchard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Management of their housing estates, including dealing with anti-social behaviour, is a matter for individual local authorities who have been encouraged by my Department to use the statutory powers available to them where appropriate.</P>
      <P>In the first instance the tenancy agreement, which is the legal basis of the relationship between the local authority and its tenants, will generally contain provisions in relation to the type of behaviour that is acceptable, and that which is not. The local authority is empowered under section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, to initiate proceedings to secure an eviction where a tenant has breached the conditions of the tenancy agreement.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, provides for a range of measures to assist local authorities in addressing problems arising on their estates from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour. It forms a part of a wider range of measures undertaken by Government to deal with the issue of drugs and related crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main provisions of the 1997 Act enables a local authority tenant, or the authority itself in certain circumstances, to apply for an excluding order against a person who is believed to be engaging in anti-social behaviour. The authority may seek such an order only after consul<Col N="1236" /> tation with the tenant and the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>The effect of an excluding order, if granted, is to exclude the person to whom it relates from the local authority dwelling and, at the discretion of the court, from any other specified dwelling or housing estate. This procedure allows for a targeted response to the problem of anti-social behaviour by an individual member of a household, without the need to remove the entire household.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Act also enables the Garda, on notification by the housing authority, to direct people squatting in local authority accommodation and engaged in anti-social activity to leave the accommodation. This has proved to be an effective means of dealing with anti-social behaviour where squatting is involved.</P>
    <P>Information received in my Department from local authorities indicates that in 1999, excluding orders were sought in five cases, three of which were sought by tenants and two by local authorities. In the same period, illegal occupiers were removed from local authority dwellings in 105 cases.</P>
    <P>Other important provisions in the 1997 Act include: powers for the local authority to refuse to let or sell a dwelling where the local authority considers that a person is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour or that it would not be in the interest of good estate management; discretion is given to health boards to refuse supplementary welfare assistance for private housing accommodation to persons who have been evicted from or refused local authority housing on grounds of anti-social behaviour; provision for exchange of information between local authorities, voluntary housing bodies, health boards and other relevant organisations; provision that Courts may accept statements by gardaí, housing authority or health boards officials as evidence of anti-social behaviour in proceedings for repossession under section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, or excluding orders under the 1997 Act, where the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so and that other possible witnesses would be prevented from giving evidence due to intimidation.</P>
    <P>Local authority tenants who purchase their homes under the tenant purchase scheme cease to be tenants of the local authority and are in effect private home owners who are subject to the normal legal code in relation to anti-social behaviour. I am advised that provisions which may be applied by local authorities in respect of houses of which they are the owner cannot be applied in respect of private houses, regardless of whether acquired through tenant purchase arrangements.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table. The board currently has a membership of ten, including the chairman. Ordinary members are appointed for a five year term or until they reach the age of 65 years. The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, as amended, provides for a permanent board membership of six. However, because of the ongoing increase in the number of appeals to the board, the number of board members was increased by four to ten on a temporary basis until 6 November 2001, pursuant to section 1 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1998. It follows that vacancies on the board are filled as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of the board is appointed for a seven year term by Government from among a list of candidates recommended by a statutory selection committee, established in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the 1983 Act. The appointment of ordinary members of the board is governed by section 7 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, as amended by section 1(f2&gt;b) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, <Col N="1239" /> 1998. One appointment as an ordinary member of An Bord Pleanála is made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government from among the officers of the Minister who are established civil servants. Other appointments as ordinary members of the board are made by the Minister from among persons nominated by organisations on panels which are prescribed as being representative of a number of interests, namely physical planning and development; the environment and amenities; economic development and construction industry; and social, economic and general interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> The Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for a permanent complement of eight board members, including the chairperson. Similar to the current legislation, it also provides for the appointment of additional ordinary members to the board where the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is of the opinion that the number of cases being received by the board is at such a level that it necessitates the appointment of one or more additional board members in order for the board to fulfil it statutory duty and objective. Regulations giving effect to these provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, are being prepared.</P>

      <P>Under article 120 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, where a proposed local authority development involves the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the environmental impact statement must be available for inspection free of charge and for purchase, at the offices of the local authority at specified times during a specified period, which shall be not less than one month beginning on the day of publication of the notice. Article 121 of the regulations provides that such an environmental impact statement, or extracts from the statement must be made available for purchase for a fee, set by the authority, not exceeding the reasonable cost of making the copy.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the fee determined by Dublin Corporation for purchase of the statement was questioned in a submission made to me. However, my Department's inspector who undertook an assessment of the environmental impact statement considered that the fee was not in conflict with the regulations.</P>

Many who wish to return home are in a position to provide housing from their own resources. Others, however, may require accommodation from a local authority or approved voluntary housing organisation. Applications or inquiries about eligibility for local authority housing should be directed by the individual to the local authority in whose functional area they wish to reside. Information on accommodation provided by approved voluntary housing organisations may be obtained from the Irish Council for Social Housing, 84 Merrion Square, Dublin 2, which is the representative organisation for the voluntary and non-profit housing sector.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced last July. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 440 and 441 together.</P>
      <P>Part M of the building regulations, which has been in effect since 1 June 1992, places a duty on persons constructing or extending public buildings, whether publicly or privately owned, to provide access for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The provision of access facilities to other existing buildings is a matter for the owners and occupiers of the buildings concerned. Departments and local authorities have been requested by my Department on a number of occasions to ensure that appropriate provision is made for access facilities for people with disabilities to all buildings under their control.</P>
      <P>I amended part M of the regulations in June 2000 following a public consultation process. The amended part M which came into effect on 1 January 2001 requires all new dwellings to be visitable by people with disabilities. It also places a more stringent legal requirement for the suitability of disabled access to new non-residential buildings, including places of employment and leisure, hotels and cinemas. Such access will now have to be &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;, not just &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Compliance with the regulations is primarily a matter for the owners, designers and builders of the buildings involved. I have issued a revised Technical Guidance Document M, 2000 edition, on how to comply with the requirements of the amended part M.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local building control authorities are responsible for monitoring and enforcement of compliance with the regulations. Since my appointment as Minister in 1997 I have urged local authorities to more actively enforce all parts of the building regulations, including part M. In particular, my Department's circular letter BC 7/99 of 17 June 1999 specifically called for stricter enforcement of part M. I have sanctioned the appointment of building control officers and increased building control fees to fund stricter <Col N="1246" /> local enforcement. At present, 85% of authorities are carrying out inspections. About two-thirds of authorities have achieved the target level of inspection, 12%-15% of developments, and I have told the remaining authorities that they must do so by 30 June 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have statistics on the number of instances where it has been determined, by the local building control authority or the courts, that part M has not been complied with in the case of privately or publicly owned buildings.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities relating to access to buildings are set out in the Commission's report, A Strategy for Equality, 1996. The progress in implementing all individual recommendations, including those relating to building control, is set out in the progress report Towards Equal Citizenship, December 1999, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The various measures I have taken to extend and strengthen part M, and to promote stricter enforcement by local building control authorities, are consistent with the broad thrust of the commission's recommendations. A core recommendation of the commission was the introduction of a disabled access certificate, along the lines of the existing fire safety certificate. This certificate would be issued by the local building control authority confirming that a planned building, if constructed in accordance with drawings lodged with the authority, would comply with the requirements of part M. I am considering the feasibility of implementing this recommendation in the context of the drafting of proposals for legislation to strengthen the enforcement powers of local building control authorities.</P>

      <P>My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads urges local authorities, when planning and executing road works and particularly the planning and designing of pedestrian facilities to pay particular attention to the needs of the mobility impaired. The memorandum also advises local authorities to take care to avoid steep or irregular gradients or sharp changes in the alignment of footpaths, where possible to provide kerbs which should be dished and with wheelchair ramps at pedestrian crossing points and to consult local representatives of persons with impairments in relation to these issues where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> The types of works referred to may be undertaken by local authorities using discretionary improvement grants or in the case of urban authorities their block grants. In this context I introduced a special block grant in 1999 for urban authorities for carriageway and footpath restoration. Funding of £4.2 million, £6.25 million and £8.95 million has been provided for this restoration in 1999, 2000 and 2001 respectively.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of the national road network rests with the the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own expenditure requirements in the context of its annual estimates. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources, including the local Government fund and other State grants, rates, fees and charges. Expenditure arising as a result of the provision of additional staffing would be dealt with by local authorities in this estimates context.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as part of my reforms of local government, I have greatly increased the allocations to local authorities from the local Government fund to support their day-to-day activities. In 2001, I have allocated £436 million in general purpose grants to local authorities, an increase of almost 64% on the initial 1997 allocation. I have also sought to distribute such funds among local authorities in a more equitable manner. The 2001 allocation represents an across the board increase of a minimum of 12.5% over the previous years' allocation to all local authorities. In addition, in continuing the trend towards equalisation, some local authorities have been given increases in excess of this level on the basis of the needs and resources model. Staffing costs of local authorities is one of the factors taken into account in the model's calculations.</P>

      <P>The National Roads Authority &ndash; NRA &ndash; has assumed direct <Col N="1248" /> responsibility for the provision of directional signage and delineation on national roads. Issues arising in this connection may be appropriately addressed to NRA.</P>
      <P>My Department has published the Traffic Signs Manual, 1996, as a comprehensive guide to the provision of road signage in Ireland. It prescribes the design, formats, dimensions and positioning of all road signs and the standards required to ensure that road users are given messages clearly and in good time. The use of the manual is intended over time to lead to greater uniformity of practice and to the creation of a more consistent approach to signing generally.</P>
      <P>In its role of oversight of the non-national roads programme, my Department issued a circular letter to road authorities in August 1998 emphasising the importance of providing and maintaining a high standard of road signage. My Department's Memorandum on Grants for Non-National Roads, which issued on 5 February 2001, again reminded local authorities of the need to bring their signage on the non-national road network up to the standards of the Traffic Signs Manual. This memorandum also reminded local authorities of the need to provide road signposting so as to assist foreign tourists at points of entry to the country and to remedy any deficiencies in this regard as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>There has been significant investment in the non-national road network in recent years. Central funding has increased from £174.8 million in 1997 to £323.23 million in 2001, an increase of 85%. This level of investment has brought about marked improvements to the network, particularly through the restoration programme which aims to restore all local and regional roads in county council areas which were deficient in 1995 by the end of 2005. The significantly increased funding being provided to local authorities is intended to meet their ongoing needs in relation to the non-national road network which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of adequate signposting.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced last July.</P>

      <P>My Department has engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry &ndash; SIMI &ndash; the Irish Motor Vehicle <Col N="1250" /> Recyclers Association &ndash; IMVRA &ndash; the Metal Merchants Association of Ireland &ndash; MMAI &ndash; and other concerned parties with a view to the development of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to end-of-life vehicles &ndash; ELVs. It is intended that such an initiative would, in particular, take account of Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on end-of-life vehicles. This directive entered into force on 21 October 2000, and member states must implement its requirements by April 2002.</P>
      <P>The directive incorporates a number of significant proposals, including measures aimed at ensuring that relevant economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs at no cost to the final holder, ensuring that all collected ELVs are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution, preventing waste from vehicles, increasing the recovery and recycling rates of ELVs and their components, and minimising the use of hazardous materials-substances in vehicles.</P>
      <P>On the invitation of my Department, and in anticipation of the adoption of the Directive, an initial proposal for an ELV management system for Ireland was submitted by SIMI in December 1999. Following the formal adoption of the directive in October 2000 and consultation with other interested parties including IMVRA, MMAI, relevant Departments and State agencies, my Department responded to the initial SIMI proposal in November 2000. With a view to progressing the development of a practicable industry-led scheme, my Department convened an initial joint meeting of all relevant stakeholders earlier this month. The relevant stakeholders have been requested to submit a joint proposal for a practicable ELV management scheme as soon as possible. It is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme, and to give effect to Directive 2000/53/EC, at an early date.</P>

      <P>The 1997 report of the Strategic Review Committee on the Construction Industry recommended that the title of &ldquo;Architect&rdquo; be registered by law; and that the registration system be administered by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland &ndash; RIAI.</P>

      <P>To carry out excavations on a public road, a person or body must have the consent of the road authority or be acting under specific enabling legislation such as applies to statutory undertakers. For persons or bodies other than statutory undertakers, section 13(10) of the Roads Act, 1993, makes it an offence to excavate-open a public road without lawful authority or the consent of the road authority &ndash; such a consent may include such restrictions and conditions as the local authority thinks fit.</P>
      <P>Section 254 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for a system of licensing by planning authorities of certain appliances, cables and pipelines. This licensing would not apply to cables, wires or pipelines provided by a statutory undertaker. Regulations to bring section 254 into force are due to be brought before the Oireachtas shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, empowers prescribed road authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers, including telecommunications operators, and others for the purposes of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption. Such directions may specify matters such as the times at which road works are to be carried out, the period within which road works must be completed, the manner in which works are to be carried out, and requirements in relation to the control of traffic in the vicinity of road works. Under the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, the main urban authorities, Dublin Corporation, South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Cork Corporation, Limerick Corporation, Waterford Corporation and Galway Corporation, were prescribed as authorities which may exercise these powers. The majority of road openings by statutory undertakers occur in the areas of these auth<Col N="1253" /> orities and the question of prescribing additional local authorities is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Section 53 of the Roads Act, 1993, also contains provisions for control of road works in relation to motorways, busways or protected roads.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved the drafting of the Communications (Regulation) Bill, 2000, which will, <i>inter alia</i>, include provisions in relation to road openings by telecom operators. These provisions will ensure that the regulatory framework, which will apply to such operators, will afford appropriate and updated powers to road authorities to regulate road openings in the public interest. I am also considering a wider legislative updating to deal with this important matter.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the delay in a final decision in a widow's non-contributory pension appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of widows non-contributory pension at the reduced weekly rate of £69.50. Following a review of her entitlement, her means, derived from a British retirement pension and income from the letting of a holding, were found to have increased. Her basic rate of payment was reduced accordingly to £57.50 per week. In addition to her basic rate of pension, the person concerned is also in receipt of a living alone allowance of £6.00 per week and a fuel allowance of £5 per week.</P>
      <P>The person's appeal against this decision to the social welfare appeals office was considered by an appeals officer who requested that further inquiries be made in the matter. These have now been completed. Following examination of all the evidence, the appeals officer has decided that the means have been properly and accurately assessed in accordance with legislation and has disallowed the appeal. The person concerned has been notified of the outcome. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department will arrange a compensation package of benefits for those who will have to sign on short-term due to the foot and mouth scare resulting in particular in the suspension of the marts and the short-term lay off of employees; if the circumstances of each case can be examined in order that as little hardship as possible is caused; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Employees who are laid off due to the foot and mouth scare may qualify for unemployment assistance &ndash; UA &ndash; or unemployment benefit &ndash; UB &ndash; subject to the conditions for receipt of UA-UB being satisfied. Each case is decided on its own merits within the framework of the legislation. A full-time worker who is laid off due to a cessation of work would normally satisfy the conditions of being available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>Consequently, s/he would qualify for an unemployment payment subject to satisfying the contribution conditions for UB, or the means test for UA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons whose self-employment has ceased due to the foot and mouth alert may also qualify for <Col N="1255" /> unemployment assistance for the duration of the lay off. As this payment is subject to a means test, income from all sources is taken into account in the assessment.</P>
    <P>In addition, the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme, provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. In the event that a person does not qualify for an unemployment payment or is awaiting a decision on his claim, he or she can apply for SWA at their local health centre and the community welfare officer will assess them on the basis of their present circumstances and immediate needs. A weekly addition may also be paid to a person who is receiving a basic allowance, or some other social welfare or health board payment, if his/her means are insufficient to meet their needs and they have specific weekly expenses, for example, rent-mortgage interest, special heating needs, dietary or other expenses. The Deputy will also be aware that the farm assist scheme provides income support for farmers on low incomes. It is open to any farmer adversely affected by the foot and mouth scare to avail of the supports provided under this scheme or, if applicable, to seek a review of his-her current entitlements under farm assist. These schemes are designed to provide income support to low-income families in a wide range of circumstances including those resulting from the present foot and mouth scare.</P>

      <Quest>if he will list, in respect of County Kerry, for each of the years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 the grants, projects or schemes funded by his Department, or any agency under the aegis of his Department; the receiving body or organisation; and the amount allocated in each instance.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, and agencies which come under the aegis of my Department, provide funding for a number of grant schemes, projects and programmes as follows: grant schemes &ndash; scheme of grants to locally based community and family support groups; scheme of grants to voluntary organisations; community development education and training grants scheme; scheme of community support for older people grants for voluntary organisation providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services; grants for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights; employment support services grants; once-off grant schemes, scheme of grants to locally based community and family support groups, scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and community development education and training grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The above once off grant schemes provide support for local self-help groups, community <Col N="1256" /> development, welfare rights and information work.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.</P>
    <P>The grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services scheme which is administered by my Department provides grants to support activity in the areas of marriage counselling, marriage preparation courses, child counselling in relation to parental separation and bereavement counselling and support on the death of a family member.</P>
    <P>Grants are paid for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights awareness and for supporting voluntary sector organisations to undertake approved projects.</P>
    <P>My Department also operates a number of long-term funding programmes which are collectively referred to as the community support programmes: community development programme; family and community services resource centre programme; programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these programmes is to provide seed money to enable locally based community groups to pilot initiatives in relation to poverty and disadvantage. The programmes are concerned with promoting positive change in society in favour of those who benefit least from economic development and are focused primarily on enhancing the capacity of those experiencing poverty and disadvantage to participate more effectively in society.</P>
    <P>There are fifty money advice and budgeting service projects supported by my Department around the country at present, including one in Tralee. These projects provide an advice and budget management service to people in difficulty with moneylending and over indebtedness.</P>
    <P>The family mediation service &ndash; FMS &ndash; provides a professional and confidential service for couples who have decided to separate, or who have already separated, to negotiate their own separation agreement. The service is free and available at 11 locations nationwide, including Tralee. The FMS is an integral part of my Department.</P>
    <P>Details of all the grants made by my Department in the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 are available in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members. However these are, in the main, listed under my Departments regions rather than by county. Details of the grants made by my Department in the year 2000 are currently being finalised and will be made available within the coming weeks, with the exception of the marriage, child and bereavement counselling grants for 2000, which are presently available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>A special fund, employment support services grants, is provided by my Department to provide financial assistance for projects designed to help <Col N="1257" /> the unemployed and lone parents to return to work, education or training. A list of those grants paid in respect of County Kerry for the years 1997 to 2000 follows.</P>
    <P>Other agencies which come under the aegis of my Department include the Combat Poverty Agency and Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency &ndash; CPA &ndash; operates a number of schemes and grants to support the development of anti-poverty activity. The overall purpose is to provide funding to facilitate community and voluntary groups to influence policy at local, regional and national level for the benefit of those affected by poverty. Details of all the grants paid by the CPA in the years 1997, <Col N="1258" /> 1998 and 1999 are available in the agency's annual reports for those years, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Details of the grants paid in 2000 will not become available until later this year.</P>
    <P>Comhairle is the new national agency responsible for the provision of information, advice and advocacy on social services. It combines the former National Social Service Board with certain functions of the former National Rehabilitation Board. It provides a range of grant schemes for the support and development of the independent information-advice sector and the voluntary sector. A list of Comhairle-NSSB grants paid in respect of County Kerry for the years 1997 to 2000 follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 458 and 471 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to carers on low incomes who look after people, including children, who need full time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Based on the research carried out in the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be around 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>At the end of February 2001, there were 16,748 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that 34% of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 82% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million this year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
      <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his-her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
      <P>The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, in addition to substantial rate increases, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. It is estimated that this will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and increase the payment of almost 3,000 existing carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income <Col N="1260" /> in the region of £15,100, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £26,000 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>This represents another move towards what I consider to be the optimum situation, which is that all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. The income disregards I have introduced already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance. It is estimated that almost £180 million would be required per annum to abolish the means test and pay the basic maximum rate carer's allowance to the estimated 33,000 carers who are not in receipt of a carer's allowance. In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider the abolition of the means test to be the best way to support carers or the best use of resources but, of course, I will keep the issue under review.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance proposed the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <Quest>the number of applications for free schemes in hand in his Department; if he has sufficient personnel to deal with the situation; the number of weeks it takes to have applications processed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The free schemes administered by my Department comprise free travel, electricity-natural gas allowance, free television licence and telephone allowance. The number of claims for these schemes has grown significantly in recent years, due both to growth in the eligible population of clients and to progressive extensions of coverage to additional categories of people.</P>
      <P>In the normal course, my Department would expect to receive some 104,000 claims this year under these schemes. In 2000, the Government significantly extended the electricity-gas and telephone allowance schemes to cover all persons over age 75, and to recipients of carer's allowance. This involved claims for the various allowances from some 21,300 additional new clients and from carers. This policy was continued in 2001 by the further extension of the free schemes to all those over 70 years of age. These further improvements are expected to benefit some 43,000 new clients resulting in the processing of 80,000 additional claims for the various allowances involved. An additional 10,000 claims are expected from new carer's allowance recipients as a result of changes in the means test for that group.</P>
      <P>These improvements have given rise to a once-off high level of additional claims in 2000 and will do so again in the current year. Additional staff and overtime resources were applied by the Department to deal with the extra work volumes in 2000 and further resources are being assigned now to deal with the extra 2001 intake. The increased claim intake must be managed over a period of months and will inevitably have some short-term adverse effect on the service to all free scheme applicants until such time as the abnormal intake is processed.</P>
      <P>At the end of February 2001, the latest date for which statistics are available, there were no backlogs of free travel scheme claims on hands. In relation to electricity-gas and telephone allowances 47% of all new claims are being awarded within seven weeks from date of claim receipt. The resources available are expected to be sufficient to process the additional claims work arising this year and to bring claim processing output progressively back to the target level of 70% awarded within seven weeks. In particular all those new clients over 75 who applied under the budget 2000 provisions have had their allowances credited to their utility bills with effect from the due date in October 2000. Claims being received from this group on an ongoing basis are being processed in the normal way as they arise.</P>
      <P>The Department is continuing to monitor its ongoing staffing requirements in the free schemes and other operational areas in the light of claim volumes and other work priorities and in the light of the overall resources available.</P>

      <P>Companion free travel passes are available to certain people who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge. In addition, since September 1998, all people aged 75 years or over, who are unfit to travel alone, qualify for a companion free travel pass.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes examined the issue of extending the companion free travel pass scheme further and noted that CIE has expressed concerns about the operation of the companion pass, in particular that anecdotal evidence would suggest that some pass holders are quite capable of travelling alone. In this regard, the review notes that companion passes should be issued only to people who have definite needs.</P>
      <P>In view of the free travel scheme's objective to encourage recipients to remain mobile, the review recommends that a free travel companion pass should be issued to all people in receipt of invalidity pension who are unable to travel alone. This would standardise the qualifying conditions for a companion pass for both invalidity pension and disability allowance. This proposal, which has expenditure implications, will be considered in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must satisfy a number of basic conditions as follows: enter social insurance before age 56, for the old age, contributory, pension, and age 55, for the retirement pension; and have a minimum of 156 full rate contributions paid 260 if the yearly average is less than 20. This requirement for all contributors will increase to 260 and 520 paid contributions from April 2002 and April 2012, respectively; and have a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or the date of entry into social insurance, if later.</P>
      <P>A yearly average of 48 contributions is required for a full rate pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 2000 I launched the report on phase 1 of the review of the qualifying conditions for <Col N="1263" /> the old age, contributory, and retirement pensions. This report identified the key issues in relation to qualification conditions. It also sets out suggested guiding principles and outlines a framework for reform.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations involves a change in the qualifying conditions from the current one, based on average yearly contributions, to a system based on the total number of contributions paid-credited over a person's working life. This would represent a very significant change in approach for overall pensions policy.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this proposal, including cost and operational issues, is being considered in the second phase of the review, which commenced recently. This phase of the review will, amongst other things, involve an examination of the appropriate number of contributions required for various rates of pension. I expect to receive this report later this year. Any changes to the current arrangements will be considered in the light of this report and budgetary considerations.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones. The fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks, as announced in this year's budget. The current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001 and the next fuel season will start one week earlier in October 2001.</P>
      <P>The standard £5 per week rate of fuel allowances was set at its present level in 1985 and the smokeless fuel allowance was not increased since its introduction in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluation studies. The working group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated <Col N="1267" /> recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowance payment rate cannot be looked at in isolation from primary payment rates as every person who gets a fuel allowance also gets a weekly primary social welfare payment, such an unemployment assistance or old age pension. It is important that the overall increase, taking primary payments and fuel allowances together, is sufficient to fully compensate for all inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    <P>Increases in overall weekly social welfare payment rates have compensated fully for inflation, including fuel price inflation, in the period from October 1985. For example, the total weekly payment for a single retirement pensioner with a fuel allowance rose by over 79%. This does not take into account the increases announced in this year's budget which were the largest ever provided.</P>
    <P>To put this in perspective, fuel price inflation since October 1985, as tracked in the fuel and light component of the consumer price index was 22.8% in total. The overall consumer price index rose by 51.6% in that period.</P>
    <P>Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, I believe it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case. These facilities are considered to be a more appropriate mechanism for meeting heating needs outside the fuel season.</P>

This directive essentially provides that part-time workers may not be treated less favourably than their full-time counterparts in relation to the terms and conditions of employment, including pensions. The pensions aspects of this directive will also be addressed in the context of work on the new pensions Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The various weekly social welfare payments can be broadly divided into two main categories, social insurance payments and means-tested social assistance payments. As social insurance payments are not subject to a means test, any income a claimant may have, including income from renting out a room, would not affect their entitlement to payment.</P>
      <P>In the case of the social assistance payments, provision already exists to cater for pensioners who rent out a room in their home. For example, in the case of the old age and widow/er's, non-contributory, pension schemes any income received in respect of rent from a person who lives with the pensioner is disregarded for means test purposes where, apart from that person, the pensioner lives alone. In the case of an old age pensioner couple, only half of any income which they have is assessed for means test purposes.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the case of the carer's allowance scheme a single claimant can have weekly income of up to £75 disregarded for means test purposes, while a couple can have up to £150 disregarded.</P>
      <P>These weekly amounts, which apply to all income, including rental income, are being increased to £125 and £250 respectively, with effect from April 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> As the value of the new tax allowance will amount to between £23 and £48.50 a week, depending on the tax rate a person is on, it will be seen therefore, that the existing means disregards which apply under the social welfare code are more favourable.</P>
    <P>Any further changes in the means-testing arrangements in relation to the assessment of rental income would have cost implications and would, therefore, have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since its commencement, a total of £22 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is available towards the cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems &ndash; such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme a maximum of 90% of the once-off costs, inclusive of VAT, associated with the purchase and/or installation of this type of equipment can be funded. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with these systems are not provided for under the scheme. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90% of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. Priority in allocating the available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands, which must be met. A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and any plans to amend the scheme will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>In July 2000, a grant of £1.45 million was approved by my predecessor to Mayo County Council for the provision of a cable car and associated services between Inishbiggle and the mainland at Béal an Bhulláin.

    </Speaker>
    <P>While it was hoped that construction of the cable car would have commenced in the spring of 2002 and that the service would be fully operational by the spring of 2003, it is now understood that an objection has been lodged against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of land <Col N="1274" /> required for the project and that it will, therefore, be necessary for An Bord Pleanála to arrange a public hearing on the issue prior to giving a decision on the said objection. I understand that Mayo County Council is currently awaiting receipt of a date for this hearing from An Bord Pleanála. However, it should be noted that no hearings are being arranged at present in the light of the ongoing foot and mouth crisis.</P>

      <Quest>if she will have investigations made into a complaint that an instruction issued on 5 July 1982 (details supplied) to personnel in Dúchas is being ignored and as a result written and verbal queries to Dúchas personnel section are not being answered; if the queries raised regarding payment of subsistence allowance will be dealt with by issuing a comprehensive reply or explanation to all staff concerned; the reason operatives on industrial grades in Kilkenny Castle and in Kilkenny national monuments depot are in receipt of four different subsistence rates despite the fact that it would appear they should be on the one scale; the workers who are in receipt of or qualify for subsistence rates C, D and E on the subsistence rates effective from 1 January 2000 by job title; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The document of 5 July 1982 referred to by the Deputy deals with the travelling and subsistence regulations applicable to established Civil Service grades, which are covered by the general council agreements under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service. The terms of this document have always been applied to the relevant grades in my Department. The specific queries, which I believe the Deputy is referring to, relate to a small number of non-established (industrial) staff. This has been the subject of discussion between the trade unions concerned and the personnel division of my Department. Action has already been taken to resolve the issue and the trade unions are being advised accordingly.</P>
      <P>There are a number of subsistence and meal allowances applicable to industrial staff depending on their grade, work location and commencement date. These allowances have all been the subject of agreement at national level with the trade unions concerned. In the case of Kilkenny the local trade unions have been supplied with written details. Some aspects of allowances are currently the subject of discussion at the National Joint Industrial Council for State Employees, which is the relevant central negotiating body. My Department will also be responding to the local trade unions regarding another specific issue, which they have raised on the subject of qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>The following grades in my Department ordinarily qualify for class C, D and E rates of subsistence under the Department of Finance Circular (11/82):&ndash;</P>
      <P>Class C Rate: general service staff in the executive officer grade, whose pay is below the maximum point of the scale for clerical officer and equivalents; Industrial staff in the grades of foremen; storekeeper clerks grades I and II and storekeeper clerks in charge; office and stores supervisors; supervisor guides and work study assessors grades I, II and III.</P>
      <P>Class D Rate: general service staff in the clerical officer grade whose pay is at or below the 8th point on the scale for clerical officers and equivalents.</P>
      <P>Class E Rate: service officers and related grades.</P>

      <Quest>if the laneway adjacent to the bus station on the Ringsend Road and leading into the docklands is owned by Dúchas; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that this laneway is now derelict and that the gate has become an eyesore; the plans she has in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The laneway adjacent to the bus station on Ringsend Road and leading to Charlotte Quay on Grand Canal Dock is owned by CIE. I understand that Waterways Ireland has a right-of-way over this area. Accordingly, the Deputy might wish to contact either body in relation to the condition of the laneway.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that Waterways Ireland, a North/South implementation body for inland waterways, was established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement and was assigned the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of certain inland navigable waterways systems throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.</P>

      <P>As has been stated in replies to previous questions on this topic, some slight movement in the Black Freren Gate occurred while construction works were being carried out by Kilkenny County Council in the vicinity of the monument in 1997. My Department has been monitoring the monument on a weekly basis up to mid-June 2000 and no further movement was observed. As the monument appears stable and no further movement has occurred, monitoring is being done on a more infrequent basis since then.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting a proposal from Kilkenny County Council to carry out repair works at the gate. The Black Freren Gate is not in the ownership of my Department and therefore I have no plans to carry out restoration works. I am satisfied with the precautions taken to safeguard the structure.</P>

      <P>To date, Ireland has transmitted 362 candidate special areas of conservation (cSACs) to the European Commission under the EU Habitats Directive of 21 May 1992 (92/43/EEC). In addition, a total of 110 sites have been designated as special protection areas <Col N="1278" /> (SPAs) under the EU Birds Directive (79/409/EEC). These sites( cSACs and SPAs) are listed for convenience on a county basis at Appendix 1.</P>
      <P>The mechanism for designating SACs is by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, while each SPA site (or group of sites) is designated by way of statutory instrument. The date of transmission of each cSAC is listed at Appendix 2 and the date of each Statutory Instrument relating to SPAs is listed at Appendix 3 and these have been forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have made arrangements for a map showing the boundaries of the cSACs and SPAs to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Dúchas has completed five prosecutions under the Habitats Regulations, a further five cases are listed for court hearing over the coming weeks and two cases are in the early stage of preparation for prosecution. All these offences arise from the notifiable actions, i.e., the list of activities that are potentially damaging to a particular SAC, and that should not be undertaken without obtaining my consent in advance. In every case damage was done to the relevant SAC.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that, while I regard prosecution as the last resort, nevertheless, when faced with the prospect of deliberate damage to these vulnerable sites, I will not hesitate to utilise the legal sanctions available to me.</P>

The National Monuments Acts make general provision for the protection and preservation of national monuments in State care.

      <P>Phase I of restoration works to the main block of Castletown House was completed in 1995 and involved replacing the entire roof and rebuilding the chimney and parapet. Phase II, which involved mechanical, electrical, fire prevention and security works and structural repairs to secure the fabric of the house, began in January 1997 and was completed in November 1998. Phase III, consisting primarily of structural works, site services and finishes in key areas, was completed prior to the re-opening of the house to the public in April 1999. Phase IV was substantially undertaken last year and included reroofing the colonnades and repairing the front and rear steps, using stone from an Edenderry quarry which was specially reopened to match the existing stonework. In addition a fire main was installed. The west wing of the house is currently being reroofed (Phase V) and is due for completion by the summer of this year. The total cost of these five phases amounts to £7.9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable programme of works remains to be done on a continuing phased basis including <Col N="1311" /> interior restoration, improved visitor facilities, parking and works to outbuildings and grounds. In this regard, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, notwithstanding the substantial funding which I have already allocated to this project to date, I propose to make significant additional funding available to proceed with this programme of works from the funds allocated to me under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. As planning for the programme is done on a phased basis and bearing in mind that the works will take a considerable period of time to accomplish, my Department is not in a position to furnish estimates for completion of the programme at this stage. I can inform the Deputy, however, that the next major project on the agenda is the provision of visitor facilities, which should greatly enhance the attraction of this historic property as a tourist destination of significant importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have advised previously on several occasions, the position remains that only one of the three local authorities involved, South Dublin County Council, has completed the legal formalities in this case. The delay in completing the process is attributable primarily to concerns of Fingal County Council and to a lesser extent of Kildare County Council. Although these concerns have long since been addressed neither Fingal council nor Kildare County Council has yet completed the transfer documents.</P>
      <P>Since acquiring the property in August 1996 both my Department and the Chief State Solicitor's office have done everything in their power to ensure that the transfer of the property is completed as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>While my Department has been given to understand that Fingal council and Kildare County Council are now agreeable to completing the legal formalities, it is a matter in the final analysis for both authorities to deliver in this regard and honour the commitments entered into by them in 1996.</P>

      <P>Initially, restoration of Maynooth Castle was viewed by my Department as a single project. However, resource availability constraints obliged me to take a phased view of the project. Accordingly, in 1999 I approved a first phase of the Maynooth Castle restoration project. As stated in my recent replies to Parliamentary Questions of 7 December 2000 and 6 February 2001, once the castle is open to the public in the second half of 2001 my Department will then be in a position to assess the needs of the site in terms of visitor numbers and facilities and make a determination as to the level, if any, of additional works required to ensure its successful operation. This remains the position.</P>

      <P>I am aware that my Department in September 2000 received a formal notice relating to the rezoning of the lands in question, and that the deadline for submissions relating to this was 22 December. Officials in my Department in early December prepared a formal response to this notice recommending that an archaeological assessment be undertaken in advance of any decision to proceed with the rezoning. However, this response was not issued to Sligo Corporation due to an administrative oversight. When this omission was discovered, an official from Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, contacted the corporation last month to see if the rezoning issue had been decided upon and was informed that it was listed for discussion at the next meeting of the corporation, which was scheduled for 5 March. At that stage, a request was made to the corporation to accept a late submission. While the corporation official agreed to include the late submission, he did point out that, as the submission was outside the time limit, he could not guarantee that the Corporation would consider it at their meeting. However, as a result of the foot and mouth restrictions, this meeting was cancelled and the rezoning issue will now be discussed at the April meeting. My understanding is that the comments raised by my officials regarding the rezoning issue will be considered at this meeting.</P>

      <P>The 1949 United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others was negotiated and entered into force several years before Ireland joined the United Nations in 1955. The convention is somewhat outdated and there have been more recent developments in the UN and the EU context. The United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and the protocol to this convention to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, were signed by Ireland in December of last year. My Department is currently involved in negotiations on two draft EU framework decisions on combating trafficking in human beings and on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. These framework decisions will be comprehensive and they will take full account of current activities and developments in these <Col N="1316" /> unscrupulous practices. When the negotiations have successfully concluded, I will introduce any legislation that is necessary to update our current law to ensure that the two framework decisions and the UN protocol are fully implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>No application for a Garda CCTV system has been received, to date, by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems, in respect of Westport.</P>
      <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting, etc.</P>
      <P>I announced last November that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed in the period 2001-02.</P>
      <P>I am, however, also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards <Col N="1317" /> will have to be met and the gardaí will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>The members of the visiting committees do not receive any payment other than standard travel and subsistence expenses at Civil Service rates which they might claim.</P>
      <P>Members of committees are appointed by the Minister for a term not exceeding three years. At that point they are automatically removed from the committee and are either reappointed for a further term or are replaced by new members.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 28 public service vehicle inspector posts, of which six posts are vacant at present. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the Commissioner has put in place a procedure for filling these six posts.</P>

    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the workload of public service vehicle inspectors is reducing as the national car testing facilities are being used for the certification of public <Col N="1342" /> service vehicles &ndash; taxis and hackneys &ndash; in conjunction with Garda testing.</P>
    <P>Under the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000 the commissioner will cease the certification of small public service vehicles after the 30 June 2001 as this work will then be carried out by NCT.</P>
    <P>The certification procedure currently occupies a considerable amount of time of Garda public service vehicle inspectors. The freeing up of the inspectors' time will allow them to concentrate on other road traffic and road transport enforcement duties.</P>

      <P>In relation to the average waiting time, I am informed that the Legal Aid Board does not maintain information relating to the average waiting time for people seeking its services. However, it does record the length of time which the person who is longest on the waiting list has waited. The following table shows the average of these waiting times in respect of each law centre during 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Although no incidents of the type specified by the Deputy have been recorded by the Garda authorities to date, I am acutely aware that the problem of trafficking in human beings, including children, by gangster type syndicates has become a major problem internationally and a significant facet of transnational organised crime.</P>
      <P>In so far as arrival at points of entry to the State are concerned, the position is that all persons must be in a position to satisfy an immigration officer of their identity and nationality and, where an immigration officer believes that an adult travelling with a minor may not be the parent or legal guardian of that child, then further inquiries will be made. In addition, there are specific procedures established under the Refugee Act, 1996, which was commenced in full by me on 20 November 2000, and which take account of situations where an unaccompanied minor arrives in the State. In such a case an immigration officer is now required to inform the relevant health board and thereupon the provisions of the Childcare Act, 1991, apply in respect of the child in question. These controls are an important element in the overall efforts of the Garda Síochána to prevent and combat trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of a comprehensive intelligence base and closer co-operation with immigration authorities in other jurisdictions are also essential elements in combating the type of activity to which the Deputy refers and was one of the main reasons the Government approved <Col N="1345" /> the setting up of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 9 May 2000 following consultation with the Garda Commissioner. The bureau has already established effective operational co-operation with immigration and police authorities in other jurisdictions and Garda liaison officers have been assigned to London and Paris for the purpose of interacting with local law enforcement authorities on immigration and trafficking matters. The bureau also liaises closely with carrier companies whose routes have been targeted by traffickers.</P>
    <P>From a legislative point of view, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, made it an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into, transit through or exit from the State of a child for the purpose of the child's sexual exploitation, or to provide accommodation for such a child while in the State. The penalty on conviction on indictment for that offence is a maximum of life imprisonment, a reflection of the seriousness of this type of crime. In addition, the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, targets professional traffickers in human beings by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and providing a framework by which those engaging in such trafficking can be dealt with under the law. The penalty on conviction on indictment for the offence of trafficking under the Act is an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>

Subsequent to the commencement of the investigation, the garda who had made the allegations in question, instituted proceedings in the High Court.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that, as the proceedings relate substantially to the matters investigated by the chief superintendent, they are of the view that it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this stage. Given that the matter is now before the courts I share this view.</P>

      <P>Recent media reports on proposals to close Garda stations are without foundation.</P>
      <P>Under the Strategic Management Initiative a fundamental review of all aspects of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Siochana is under way. The aim is to position the Garda organisation to respond efficiently and effectively to the challenges it faces in this new millennium. Substantial progress has been achieved and new systems of financial management, human resource management, training and promotion have been developed.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants were recruited to carry out a review of the Garda structures, work processes and systems. Under the terms of reference, the consultants are required to develop the HQ and regional organisation structures, review the HQ specific and core role functions, review the roles of ranks, and develop criteria in relation to stations.</P>
      <P>I am advised that in assessing criteria in relation to stations the consultants will be focusing on the best use of Garda resources to deliver a policing service to the community. The consultants will not recommend the closure of any Garda stations but will highlight criteria which could be taken into account in any future assessment of how the functioning or location of Garda stations best serves the community.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals in relation to opening or closing Garda stations. The consultants' review of Garda structures and operating systems will not report until August or September this year. Any recommendations in their report will then be considered by the Garda SMI steering group and ultimately by Government.</P>

      <P>I am informed that applicants from the Kildare area can apply for legal services either at the full-time law centre in Newbridge or at any of the Dublin based law centres that are more convenient to them. The Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, an applicant for legal services may apply to any law centre in the State, regardless of his or her home address. In this regard, while law centres serve no particular catchment area, their location is determined on the basis of providing the widest possible access to legal services.</P>
      <P>I understand that while the Legal Aid Board has no plans at present to open a further law centre in County Kildare, the situation will continue to be monitored in the context of its ongoing review of demand for legal services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, at present before this House arose primarily from an analysis of the views received on the chapter of the Discussion Paper on the Law on Sexual Offences which dealt with a sex offenders register and post-release supervision. When the Bill is enacted the remaining chapters of the discussion paper will be examined in the light of an analysis of the views received on them. Among the wide range of issues addressed in the discussion paper was the position of the complainant in the criminal trial process. Chapter 5 of the paper sets out the measures already introduced over recent years to improve that position. The question of <Col N="1348" /> whether there is a need for any further legislative or other measures will form part of the forthcoming examination.</P>
      <P>The Victims Charter, which I published in 1999, specifically provides for the Garda to keep all victims, including victims of sex abuse, informed about the progress of an investigation, including whether a suspect is charged or cautioned. Where a suspect is charged, the charter provides for a range of information to be given by the Garda to the victim, including details of court hearings. For victims of sex abuse, information about specialist services is also supplied and such victims are advised about the circumstances under which a judge may ask for victim impact statements.</P>
      <P>In the case of sexual crimes the complainant-victim is kept informed of the progress of the investigation by the Garda. This does not, however, include informing the complainant of the movements of the alleged abuser. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, all persons are innocent until proven guilty and infringements of their constitutional rights would not always be in the interest of justice.</P>
      <P>The Sex Offenders Bill, when introduced, will place certain requirements on convicted sexual offenders and will provide authority to the Garda in cases where sexual offenders fail to take certain steps, e.g. notification of changes of address, notification of leaving the State.</P>
      <P>Section 10 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Persons Act, 1997 provides for protection to victims. In relation to complaints arising out of harassment by alleged abusers on their victim, any such cases should be brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána and would be treated very seriously by the Garda.</P>

While in custody in Mill Street Garda Station, Galway, he made a number of inculpatory statements implicating himself in the murder of the two women to which the Deputy refers though I understand that he later retracted his statements of admission. The Garda Commissioner then directed that an investigation into this man's alleged involvement in the murders was to be carried out by an Assistant Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I am assured by Garda authorities that the investigation which followed was a thorough one, and a complete file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration. The Director decided that no prosecution should take place.</P>

      <P>My Department has received the formal application for transfer of the person concerned from the United Kingdom authorities. It is currently being reviewed by the office of the Chief State Solicitor in order to ensure that the requirements of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 and 1997 are satisified. I await their advices in the matter. This, however, should not be assumed to confer my consent to the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> As I have explained in the past, the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place i.e. from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they are forthcoming, an application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his-her continued detention here.</P>
    <P>These procedures are required under the convention and must be adhered to in processing each application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for this application to be considered. However, every effort continues to be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Col N="1354" /> The figures represent an increase of 7.5% in the manpower at Carlow-Kildare division between 1 January 1998 and 13 March 2001.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that there has been an 8% increase in indictable crime in the area according to figures produced in relation to the provisional crime statistics for 2000.</P>
    <P>Garda management is satisfied that the current manpower strength at Carlow-Kildare division is adequate in meeting the present policing needs of the area.</P>
    <P>However, the situation will be kept under review and when additional manpower next becomes available the needs of the Carlow-Kildare division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that there are three Garda stations in County Kildare open on a 24-hour basis &ndash; Naas Garda station, Kildare Garda station and Newbridge Garda station.</P>
      <P>There are currently no plans to extend the opening hours of any other Garda stations in County Kildare. The extension of station opening hours to 24-hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoors administrative duties. Such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties.</P>
      <P>Maynooth and Celbridge Garda stations are in the Naas District. Naas Garda station is open on a 24-hour basis.</P>

      <P>My policies in combating the drugs problem are well known: tough legislation backed by strong law enforcement in tandem with an integrated partnership approach to dealing with the interlinked problems of drugs, crime and social disadvantage and while a primary emphasis of the criminal justice agencies operating under the auspices of my Department is on the law enforcement side, nevertheless, they play an appropriate role in the broader issues which arise.</P>
      <P>In relation to statistics, seizures of drugs with a combined street value in excess of £120 million were made in 1998 and 1999 and a total of 12,000 persons were prosecuted for drugs offences in those years. More detailed statistics for those years are contained in the Garda Commissioner's annual crime report. Finally, a review of the national drugs strategy is almost complete. The aim of the review is to identify gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy and to develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new structures through which to develop them. This should ensure that current policies and strategies remain relevant to the situation as it exists on the ground. It is expected that the new strategy will be launched in the near future.</P>

      <P>Schemes for capital and staffing grants for community &ndash; not for profit &ndash; group(s) are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>With regard to the application in question, I have been informed by my Department's equal opportunities child care section that a completed application form for a staffing grant from Lifestart Family Centre, Sligo was received on 14 February 2001. I understand this application was forwarded to Area Development Management Limited on 19 February 2001. A technical assessment of this application will be carried out by ADM Limited prior to referral to the programme appraisal committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors are considered in assessing applications including the location of the service, the extent to which it will enhance child care provision in disadvantaged areas, the extent to which <Col N="1356" /> the project will increase the number of places and the extent to which the service will facilitate parents in accessing training, education and employment. In the case of staffing grants for community based-not for profit groups, funding is provided to projects only in relation to the employment of workers dealing directly with children, within the child care facility.</P>
    <P>Once the assessment and appraisal process is complete, I will make a decision shortly thereafter. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this staffing application by the centre.</P>
    <P>To date I have approved grants under the equal opportunities child care programme with a total value of over £40 million towards the development of child care provision nationwide as well as the provision of supports for the national voluntary child care organisations. This funding will support almost 11,400 child care places including the creation of more than 4,800 new child care places. This represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State and is supporting measures that will have both a social inclusion and equal opportunities focus.</P>

      <P>I have no immediate plans to introduce complementary health care teams as backup for prison doctors. However, as a general principle, I hold that prisoners' health care arrangements should fully match public healthcare provision in the general community.</P>
      <P>In November 1999, I established a group to review the structure and organisation of prisons health care services. The terms of reference of this group are: to consider and make recommendations regarding the structure and organisation of primary medical and nursing services within the prison environment in light of the development of health care services generally and the needs of the prison population; to consider and make recommendations regarding the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners &ndash; taking into account changes in service provision generally and the potential ramification of possible new mental health legislation; to consider the appropriate need and level of in-house provision of specialist medical services and make recommendations accordingly; to consider structures for the legal and professionally appropriate control of pharmaceutical products within the prison system; to consider the present organisation of prison dental services and make any appropriate recommendations; to consult with all relevant professional and representative bodies in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> The review body is under the chairmanship of Mr. John Olden, a member of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment of Persons in Custody, and former Secretary of Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The membership of the review group consists of the representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Department of Health and Children; the Department of Finance; the Director of Prison Medical Services; a senior prison governor; a nominee of the Irish College of General Practitioners; a nominee of the Royal College of Psychiatry; a nominee of An Bord Altranais; a nominee of the Pharmaceutical Society; a nominee of the Irish Dental Council. As the review is still ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the group's work at this time. I expect to have a report from the group by mid-2001. It is my intention that this report will be published as soon as possible. Any recommendations made by this group in relation to improving prison health care services will be treated as a matter of priority by me.</P>

      <P>With regard to the application in question, I have been informed by my Department's equal opportunities child care section that an application for a capital grant for self-employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time was received on 2 January 2001. This application was forwarded to Area Development Management Limited on 4 January 2001 and a technical assessment of the application was carried out by ADM Limited prior to referral to the programme appraisal committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this assessment and appraisal process has been completed and following the recommendation of the programme appraisal committee, I recently approved a capital grant of IR£37,115 to the applicant in question. My Department's equal opportunities child care section has been in con<Col N="1361" /> tact with the applicant in relation to the next stage in the process.</P>
    <P>Funding of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 is targeted at services which offer day care facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours. The overall budget for the child care measure under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is £250 million. Funding for the capital grant scheme to which the Deputy refers comes from the national development plan and is co-financed by the European Union and the Irish Government. In October I announced details of further funding from the Government for child care which included a £9 million of Exchequer funds for private sector child care providers catering for more than 20 children.</P>
    <P>Up to 14 March 2001, my Department's equal opportunities child care section had received 675 applications for funding under the capital and staffing grant schemes. Of these, 193 were for capital grants for self-employed/private sector providers of child care services. To date I have approved 113 applications for self-employed-private providers of child care to a total value of almost £2.6 million</P>
    <P>The general conditions of the grant for self-employed child care providers are that: work must be of a capital nature and directly related to child care provision; the maximum grant available is £40,000; and the applicant must contribute a minimum of 35% of the cost of work.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the general guidelines for the funding measures, applications are assessed according to the following criteria: the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant to implement the project; the level of integration and co-ordination; the costing and value for money of the proposal.</P>
    <P>As a general guide, funding is intended for services such as day care, crèches, playgroups, Montessori pre-schools or child minding. A number of factors are considered in assessing applications including the location of the service, the extent to which it will enhance child care provision in disadvantaged areas, the extent to which the project will increase the number of places and the extent to which the service will facilitate parents in accessing training, education and employment opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 564 and 565 together.</P>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000 which I initiated and which came into effect on the 6 July last, provides for a considerable strengthening of the law on under age drinking. The Act takes into account many of the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee which reported on the whole area, including those recommendations which related to under age drinking. I also took into account the many submissions received from groups and members of the public following a consultation process.</P>
      <P>With a view to strengthening those provisions which already existed in legislation of 1988 in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to under age persons, I abolished the defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in any proceedings against the licence holder, increased the fines for breaches of the law on under age drinking and provided for a new penalty &ndash; a temporary closure order &ndash; for conviction of the sale of alcohol to under age persons. The removal of the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence is complementary to the voluntary age card scheme which I introduced in April 1999 in that it makes reliance on the age card scheme by licensees more important. No defence is permitted where a person wilfully supplies liquor to an under age person. Work is also in progress on preparation of the regulations necessary to give effect to section 15 of the Act of 2000. These will prescribe the form of the notice to be displayed in licensed premises containing a statement of the offences in relation to under age drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age card scheme allows any person who has attained 18 years of age to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for <Col N="1363" /> the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2 has overall responsibility for the issuing of the cards. The cards have security features, which include a hologram, incorporated into their design. I am happy to say that to date, in excess of 23,000 age cards have been issued.</P>
    <P>With a view to promoting the scheme, I launched the age card scheme awareness campaign in Dublin Castle on 6 September 2000 in conjunction with the Garda authorities who have taken the following steps to promote the use of the age card. All Garda stations have been notified of the age card scheme and issued with application forms and posters; non-Garda outlets have also been issued with application forms and posters; a poster campaign has been initiated to target all pubs, stand alone off-licences and grocery based off-licences, night-clubs and dance halls, etc; youth information centres-youth groups nation-wide have been issued with information, posters and contact numbers for further support; Garda juvenile liaison officers-community gardaí are visiting post-primary schools, youth clubs, special projects, etc. highlighting the age card scheme; there is ongoing liaison between the drinks industry and the Garda Síochána and new avenues of ensuring young people get the age card message are being explored.</P>
    <P>The additional provisions, in conjunction with the national age card scheme already outlined, will assist in combating the scourge of under age drinking.</P>
    <P>As to the immediate policing response, the Garda Commissioner has indicated on a number of occasions that special emphasis is being placed by the Garda on the enforcement of the law in relation to street crimes. A national public order initiative known as Operation Oíche has been launched by the Garda Commissioner to tackle street violence and public disorder on the streets of large towns and cities. This project essentially involves the strategic use of extra gardaí to tackle the problem of violence amongst young people at or in the vicinity of certain discos and places where youngsters gather at night. The operation focuses on the primary areas of public disorder, public intoxication, under age drinking, illicit drugs use and under age alcohol sales. Operation Oíche began as a pilot scheme in Dublin, and has been extended to large towns and cities which, in the Garda view, require a similar targeted response.</P>
    <P>The process of reforming our intoxicating liquor laws has not ended and on 1 November last, I established a Commission on Liquor Licensing under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes. The membership of the commission represents a wide range of interests and the terms of reference include all aspects of the operation of the licensing laws including an examination of the problems associated with underage drinking. I will carefully consider the <Col N="1364" /> commission's recommendations in due course, on their publication.</P>
    <P>While legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme, can help to curtail the problem of under age drinking, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. Dealing with the demand side of the under age drinking problem should not be seen as the province of the State agencies alone &ndash; in particular, parents, teachers, politicians, the drinks industry, and the creative media must also play their part in helping to address that side of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that where any property has come into the possession of the Garda Síochána in connection with any criminal charge, application may be made to the District Court for delivery of the property. An application may be made under Section 1 of the Police (Property) Act, 1897 by a member of the Garda Síochána or by a claimant of the property. Section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 provides that an order may be made under Section 1 of the Act of 1897 for the disposal of property in the possession of the Garda Síochána although no person has been charged with an offence in connection with same.</P>
      <P>Moneys received for such property are forwarded to the finance division in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the benefit of central funds. The amounts raised &ndash; for the years specified by the Deputy &ndash; are as follows: 1997 &ndash; £83,875; 1998 &ndash; £142,793; 1999 &ndash; £284,672 and 2000 &ndash; £30,371.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Legal Aid Board has sole responsibility for the provision of legal services, including the allocation of staff to particular law centres. I am advised that the additional staff resources which I obtained for the board since 1997 were assigned by the board to law centres and the refugee legal service as set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>During 2000, sanction was conveyed to the board for the recruitment of an additional 112 staff for the refugee legal service and, as suitable accommodation is now ready, recruitment to fill these posts is taking place.</P>

      <Quest>if he has any proposals to amend the Bail Act, 1997, so that persons charged with offences, who have a list of previous convictions, are not granted bail on low personal securities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bail Act, 1997 was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May 1997. In addition to tightening up the bail regime generally, the Act gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution which provided for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
      <P>Section 2(1) of the Act provides that where an application for bail is made by a person charged with a serious offence, a court may refuse the application if it is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. For this purpose a serious offence is defined as one which carries a penalty of at least five years imprisonment on conviction and which is listed in the Schedule to the Bill (e.g. murder, manslaughter, sexual offences, drugs offences). This Schedule has since been amended by the inclusion <i>inter alia</i> of certain offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that Section 2(2) of the Bail Act provides that in deciding whether or not to refuse bail in accordance with section 2(1), a court shall take into account a number of factors, including any previous convictions of the accused person.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the granting of bail in accordance with the Act and the amount of bail are matters for the courts who are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it would therefore be inappropriate for me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to comment on the exercise of these functions by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> I would however point out that in the case of <i>The People v. O'Callaghan</i> [1966] I.R. 501, it was stated in the Supreme Court that bail must not be fixed at a figure so large as would in effect amount to a denial of bail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 576 and 587 together.</P>
      <P>The overall aim of the Government's drugs strategy is to provide an effective, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse. Since 1997, local drugs task forces have also been set up in areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. The task forces bring together key State agencies to work with the local community and voluntary groups to develop appropriate responses to the local drug problem. In addition, the National Drugs Strategy Team, whose membership is drawn from Government Departments, State agencies and the community and voluntary sector, support and oversee the activities of the local drugs task forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government allocated £10 million in 1997 to support the implementation of measures contained in the action plans prepared by the task forces. More than 200 projects were allocated funding to deliver a range of interventions and over 120 of these projects have now been mainstreamed. Currently the task forces are updating their plans for the next three years and the <Col N="1371" /> Government has provided £15 million per annum for this purpose. To date, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion has approved funding of more than £3.6 million for six plans covering a variety of initiatives in the areas of prevention, education, treatment, rehabilitation and supply reduction.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse, the young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative measures in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem existed or had the potential to develop. The aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. The committee assessing the fund is chaired by my Department. More than £37 million has been allocated by Government to support more than 340 facility and services projects under the fund.</P>
    <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs was established by the Government in July 2000. Its key role is to advise Government in relation to prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of the drug problem in Ireland, based on the committee's analysis and interpretation of research findings and information available to it. It will oversee the delivery of a three year prioritised programme of research and evaluation on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug misuse in Ireland. Estimating the scale of problem drug use will be a key priority. The committee operates under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is currently finalising the review of the National Drugs Strategy. The objective of this review is to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the current strategy, develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new structures through which to develop them. The overall aim is to ensure that the policies and strategies which are being pursued at present remain relevant to the situation as it exists on the ground. The new strategy will be launched in the near future.</P>

    <P>Funding for the tourism sector is primarily carried out by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development under a number of different programmes. Apart from some direct funding by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, the main funding schemes in operation in 1997-1999 were under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 <Col N="1374" /> where the funding was allocated by independent management boards set up under the programme. Details of grants, projects and schemes, including the annual reports of the management boards, can be obtained directly from the two agencies. For the period 2000-2006, funding for tourism product development under the southern and eastern region operational programme of the NDP will be administered by Bord Fáilte. Details of the scheme will be launched shortly.</P>
    <P>Funding under sub-programme 2 of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-1999 was allocated by Area Development Management Ltd (ADM) to 38 area based partnership companies and 33 community groups to support a plan of action developed with the local community and support agencies in disadvantaged areas. For the period 2000-2006, funding will be provided through the same agency for the southern and eastern region operational programme, and the Border, midlands and western regional operational programme. Funding under the social inclusion measures of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will also be directed at activities carried out by the area based partnership companies and ADM supported community groups.</P>
    <P>There are two area based partnership companies in Kerry &ndash; South Kerry Development Partnership, Valentia Road, Caherciveen and Partnership Trá Lí, 37 Ashe Street, Tralee &ndash; and three ADM funded community groups &ndash; Kerry Rural Development, Castleisland, Ciarraí Thuaidh le Chéile Teo, Listowel and Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teo, Baile an Fheirtearaigh, Trá Lí. Details of funding provided to projects can be sourced from these companies.</P>

      <P>In general there are four stages in a swimming pool project &ndash; preliminary report stage, contract document stage, tender stage and construction stage. Grants are not allocated until such time as tenders have been approved. The preliminary report which was submitted by Fingal County Council in relation to the proposed new swimming pool in Skerries was approved by this Department. The next stage is for the council to arrange for the preparation of contract documents for the work proposed.</P>

This is currently being drawn up by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and is scheduled to be operational towards the end of the year.</P>

    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): Through the Sports Capital Programme administered by my Department, funding from the proceeds of the National Lottery is available to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations which will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation. The 2001 Sports Capital Programme was advertised in the national press on 15 and 17 December 2000. The closing date for receipt of application forms was Friday, 9 February 2001. An application was not received before this deadline from the organisation in question.

      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government was committed to targeting investment under the national development plan on a priority basis to the 25 most disadvantaged areas <Col N="1378" /> in the State. To ensure a fair and transparent process the selection of these 25 areas was made on strictly objective criteria. Using factors such as unemployment, income levels, family and social structure, educational disadvantage and high levels of rented local authority housing to identify the priority areas Sligo did not qualify for inclusion amongst the 25 most disadvantaged areas in the State.</P>
      <P>However, there are other initiatives which have been put in place by Government to tackle problems associated with social exclusion, under which the Sligo North Ward area may be eligible to benefit for projects such as that outlined by the Deputy. Local authorities have now been given a wide social inclusion remit and the main purpose of the recently established county and city development boards is to address such matters at local level on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated my concern at the impact of foot and mouth disease precautions on the tourism industry and I am fully aware of the difficulties of restricted access to cultural and heritage attractions reflected in the proposal made by coach tourism operators.</P>
      <P>The possibility of foot and mouth disease spreading to this country threatens our economic security and livelihoods, not just those of our farmers and the agriculture and food sector, but potentially of virtually every citizen. Agriculture and livestock are of such vital importance to the whole economy that we have to be thorough in our efforts to make sure that the disease does not spread with disastrous consequences.</P>
      <P>I welcome the easing of foot and mouth disease controls announced on Friday, 16 March by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I believe that the technical expert group guidelines will enable a significant number of low risk events and activities in the tourism and sports areas to recommence immediately and should facilitate the early re-opening of a number of our major tourist attractions and events. I am particularly pleased that Dublin Castle, Kilkenny Castle and the Rock of Cashel have already re-opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and Bord Fáilte have been working closely with the tourism industry to monitor developments and to advise on the impact of the control measures to date. The objective is to ensure that all reasonable efforts are made to enable tourism within Ireland to continue to operate, while ensuring that the industry does not take unnecessary risks that would jeopardise our agriculture base. I would like to express my appreciation for the support of the tourism industry in recent weeks and look for<Col N="1379" /> ward to their continuing cooperation to overcome our current difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that there is a clear message that Ireland remains open to tourism and that, subject to the taking of appropriate precautions, it remains a welcoming destination for international visitors. I encourage all those involved in the provision of tourism facilities, attractions and events to familiarise themselves with the technical expert group guidelines with a view to restoring as much of our key tourism infrastructure as possible. I am satisfied that the easing of disease control measures announced last Friday addresses in a substantive way many of the concerns of coach tourism operators as set out in their proposal.</P>

      <P>The Government set up the young people's facilities and services fund in 1998 to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The three-year fund aims to attract young people in those areas, at risk of becoming involved in drugs, into more healthy and productive pursuits. Over £37 million has been allocated to support measures under the fund.</P>
      <P>All allocations under the current round of the fund have now been made. Shortfalls have come to light in the case of five of the capital projects which were approved for funding. A list of the projects and the current estimated shortfalls, totalling over £10 million, follows. I am in consultation with the development groups and Dublin Corporation in relation to these projects and I hope to be in a position to decide shortly on how best to proceed in relation to these shortfalls.</P>

      <P>I understand that the pupil in question has not attended school since the end of the last school year when he completed transition year. I further understand that following consultations between the national educational psychological service, health board officials and the child's parents, it was decided that the pupil would be most suitably placed in a vocational training centre. Such centres cater for young adults, from school leavers up to 25 years of age, and are funded primarily by the Department of Health and Children. My Department funds the delivery of tuition services at such centres.</P>
      <P>My Department sanctioned eight hours home tuition per week in early February 2001 for the pupil in question as an interim measure while arrangements are being made for his placement in a vocational training centre. I have asked my officials to pursue this placement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> The current rate payable for home tuition services is £19.09 per hour. There are no plans at present to increase this rate. However, I understand that inquiries are being made into the possibility of addressing the shortfall to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>I understand that my Department has not received any request to carry out an educational psychological assessment on the child in question. However, I understand that the child has been assessed by the relevant health board and that the national educational psychological service has played an advisory role in this regard.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved <Col N="1387" /> an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
    <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
    <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    <P>In September, 2000, when setting up the action group on access to third level education, I announced, as an initial step pending the findings of the group, the introduction of a special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders. The adjacent and non-adjacent rates announced were £1,000 and £2,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>I have now received the report of the action group. I am at present considering the recommendations and hope to be in a position to make an initial response in the near future.</P>

      <P>No discussions concerning funding have taken place between my Department and the school referred to by the Deputy. The Deputy will be aware of the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, that I announced on 4 January last which will run over a three-year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to over 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>Schools invited to participate in the new programme were identified through a survey of educational disadvantage in primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre for my Department last year.</P>
      <P>A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils <Col N="1391" /> will be supported where necessary over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.</P>
    <P>The school in question is included in the urban dimension of the programme and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of £1,477 towards the provision of suitable educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>Where individual schools are concerned about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they may make a submission to my Department outlining their circumstances. These submissions will be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be considered further.</P>

      <P>Maintenance grants under the third level student support schemes, operated by my Department, are not, with certain exceptions, payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate qualification.</P>
      <P>The question of whether a course is categorised as an undergraduate or a postgraduate course is a matter, in the first instance, for the institute and the course validating body, in this case CIMA. My Department has received no indication that either body wishes to reclassify the course in question as a post-graduate course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to clarify the position in regard to the recognition of the higher diploma in remedial and special education course at primary and second levels. At second level, the position is that a fully qualified second level teacher, who successfully completes the higher diploma in remedial and special education course in UCD, is eligible for appointment as a remedial teacher or a resource teacher in a second level school. Second level teachers may be released from their teaching duties to attend the course in question. My Department continues to pay the salary of the teacher for the duration of the course, but the cost of a fully qualified substitute is the responsibility of the teacher.</P>
      <P>At primary level, this course has been recognised for the purposes of rule 116 of the Rules for National Schools. Under this arrangement, broadly similar course attendance and substitution provisions apply as at second level. The issue of recognition for teaching purposes does not however, arise.</P>
      <P>The issue of the secondment, that is, paid leave of absence for attendance at the course, is being considered in the context of an overall training plan for teachers in the special needs area, which is currently being developed. Officials of my Department have recently met with the relevant UCD authorities in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received a request from City of Dublin VEC to reconsider the awarding of a maintenance grant to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 24; when his Department will be in a position to award this grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7577/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>City of Dublin VEC has been in communication with my Department in relation to the case referred to by the Deputy and has confirmed that the income in this case exceeds the income limits set down in the scheme in order to qualify for a maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the terms of these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to their third level course.</P>
      <P>As the student in question was not 23 on 1 January of the year of entry to his approved third level course he cannot be assessed as a mature student. When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. Accordingly, the decision taken in this case by City of Dublin VEC is in accordance with the terms of the grants scheme and, as these are of general application, it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases.</P>
      <P>However, it is recognised that these provisions can give rise to difficulties in individual cases. I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grant schemes and the free fees provision, financial support is also available to third level students through my Department's student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies. I understand that the student in question has received assistance from this fund.</P>

      <P>My Department's maintenance grants schemes and free fees initiative contain provisions relating to residency.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for a maintenance grant under the terms of the student support schemes a candidate must fulfil conditions as to residence, age, means and nationality. To fulfil the residency requirement a candidate's parents, or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate her or himself, shall have been resident in the administrative area of the local authority or VEC from 1 October of the year prior to entry on an approved course. The local authority or VEC has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees criteria, tuition fees will be paid in respect of EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to a third level course subject to certain conditions. This condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. I understand that similar residency requirements operate in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>Candidates who are EU nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirements under the free fees initiative are eligible to apply for a means tested fees only grant in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education, in an EU member state from 1 October of the year prior to entry to college.</P>

      <P>The selection process of areas for inclusion in the RAPID programme was led by my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan.</P>
      <P>This selection was based on clear and objective criteria. The Trutz-Haase Deprivation Index was used to underpin the selection of the areas because it provided an objective basis to identify the relative levels of deprivation of district electoral divisions &ndash; DEDs. The areas selected are those which were identified as being within the category of the &ldquo;5% most deprived&rdquo; DEDs and by clustering such areas together as a nucleus it was possible to narrow the number of areas down to the required 25. The designation process was supported by data relating to significant incidences of rented local authority housing &ndash; more than 75% &ndash; and by the presence of designated disadvantaged schools as identified by my Department. Because the 25 most deprived areas are all located in the major urban centres, the Government has decided that there will be a second strand to this programme introduced in the next few months for rural areas and provincial towns. This new programme is currently being drawn up by the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Environment and Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out, as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum, £20 per pupil in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. The school in question received a grant of £13,560 for the year 2000 based on an enrolment of 339 on 30 September, <Col N="1397" /> 1999. A further grant for the year 2001 will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that, as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>

      <P>Two special classes for pupils with autism were established in the school in question in September 2000. In order to facilitate this development, two teaching posts and two special needs assistant posts were allocated by my Department in June 2000. Each of the classes in question operates at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class has special needs assistant support. A special rate of capitation funding of £447 per annum is paid in respect of each pupil attending the classes in question. The pupils are also entitled to a range of therapeutic support services provided by the relevant health authorities.</P>
      <P>An initial start-up equipment grant of £1,000 was issued to the school in July 2000 and in December 2000 my Department's building unit issued a once-off grant of £10,000 to support the special classes. A further grant of £1,660 issued recently under the IT 2000 initiative in respect of computer equipment for the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently announced a new range of measures to enhance the quality and range of special education services for children with autism. These measures include a doubling of the level of special needs assistant cover in all special classes catering for children with autism and the extension of the education programmes in such classes through the month of July. In keeping with this development, my Department has recently sanctioned two additional special needs assistants for the two classes in question. My Department is also finalising arrangements to <Col N="1398" /> extend the programme for the children in question through the month of July.</P>
    <P>I recently met with the parents of some of the children attending the special classes for autism at the school in question.

I have undertaken to address these issues and my Department will be in contact with the school authorities in relation to these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue to which the Deputy refers has been brought to my Department's attention. My Department supports the establishment of pre-schools for children of the Traveller community where the need has been identified and where a local management structure is in place. In such situations my Department grants 98% of the teachers' salaries involved and where necessary, funds the cost of transporting the children to the pre-schools. Annual funding is also provided for materials and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pre-schools for Travellers are subject to the requirements of the Child Care Act, 1991, which <Col N="1400" /> requires that a second adult must be within the confines of the school during its operation. In the case referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the presence of the two FÁS workers in addition to the class teachers, ensured that the pre-schools complied with this requirement. However FÁS has notified the pre-schools of its intention to withdraw the services of the two assistants.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in contact with the pre-schools in question in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy and has advised the management committee involved of possible ways of addressing their current difficulty. In particular, the management committee has been alerted to a scheme introduced by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which provides funding assistance to help non-profit making pre-schools, such as those in question, to comply with the requirements of the Child Care Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 636 and 665 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the request by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding, referred to by the JMB. The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its very nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, which are privately managed institutions, the Department meets the cost of teacher salaries, excluding the first £400 and allowances and makes an annual <i>per capita</i> grant towards recurrent costs, including cleaning, of schools. In addition, these schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme, including grants for the employment of secretaries and caretakers and curricular support.</P>
      <P>I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I have already shown my commitment by the establishment of the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. This funding initiative represents a new approach by the Department that supports the school development planning process. This process can only be enhanced if each school is given some flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of <Col N="1402" /> their schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000. My approach has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the end of the year 2000, two of the educational psychologists employed by my Department in the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; provided a psychological service to all post-primary schools in the city and county of Waterford. Neither of these psychologists was based in Waterford and both had responsibilities in other counties. Similarly, a Dublin-based psychologist, who had responsibilities in other areas, served post-primary schools in County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>Following the decision of the Government that NEPS should develop a psychological service that would eventually be available to all schools, my Department embarked on a programme of recruitment. Some 30 additional psychologists have been appointed since last September. This has allowed NEPS to enhance considerably the psychological service in the south-eastern region.</P>
      <P>Two NEPS psychologists have now been assigned to work exclusively in County Waterford. They have already begun work in the post-primary schools, and are now initiating a service to primary schools. It is envisaged that they will be able to provide a psychological service initially to all post-primary students in the city and county, to all primary school pupils in the city of Waterford and to a number of primary schools in the county. Office accommodation is currently being refurbished and is almost ready, so that there will soon be a NEPS office in the city.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> A newly appointed psychologist has been assigned to work exclusively in County Kilkenny. Initially, he is providing an enhanced service to post-primary schools in the county. Recruitment to NEPS is ongoing, and, as soon as another psychologist is appointed to the county, expansion of the psychological service to primary schools will begin.</P>

      <P>The national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; has recently enhanced considerably the psychological service in the south-eastern region. A newly appointed NEPS psychologist has been assigned to work exclusively in County Kilkenny. Initially, he is providing an enhanced service to all post-primary schools in the county. Recruitment to NEPS is ongoing, and, as soon as another psychologist is appointed to the county, expansion of the psychological service to primary schools will begin. It is envisaged that <Col N="1404" /> all schools in the region will have access to the NEPS service by the end of the school year 2003-04 and that there will then be six psychologists serving counties Carlow and Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>With regard to special schools, priority is being given by NEPS to special schools and units that have no access to other psychological services. I understand that psychological support for the school named by the Deputy has traditionally been provided by the South Eastern Health Board. For this reason, NEPS has not yet offered a service to the school. However, the needs of the school will be kept under review and will be borne in mind when further expansion in the county is possible. The management committee of NEPS has established a NEPS-health boards joint liaison committee to ensure that there will be a coherent approach to special schools and units.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 648 and 667 together.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the sense of concern which parents of severely and profoundly handicapped children have as regards their children's education, a concern which is clear from the submission to which the Deputy refers. However, the submission is inaccurate in several respects and misrepresents my Department's position and the considerable progress which has been made in providing for the education of children with such disabilities, especially since the O'Donoghue judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to engage in a detailed statement relating to the Supreme Court appeal in the case of Jamie Sinnott and the Minister for Education and Science, Ireland and the Attorney General. As I have previously outlined to this House, it would not be appropriate for me to do so. The Supreme Court is expected to begin its hearing of the case next week and it is in that forum that the legal issues should be debated and resolved. A key issue in the appeal will be the extent to which the Constitution imposes a constitutional duty on the State to provide for free primary education for life to any person. Any implication that this appeal is being taken so as to deny children with special educational needs access to education is entirely wrong. It is also wrong to state that the State is seeking to overturn the award of damages in the case and to seek a refund of damages paid. From the outset of the appeal I have adopted the position that the outcome of this appeal will not affect the moneys which had already been paid to Jamie Sinnott and his mother. These amounted to £42,000 to enable Mrs. Sinnott to put in place a home based applied behaviour analysis programme for her son. A sum of £15,000 has also been paid to Mrs. Sinnott to cover expenses already incurred by her in providing an education for Jamie. In addition, the Government decided that the remaining damages declared by the High Court in respect of Jamie Sinnott will be paid on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis and this element of the High Court judgment will not be appealed. The Government has also decided to <Col N="1408" /> pay all the costs arising from the High Court case and the Supreme Court appeal, whatever the outcome. In all of these matters the Government has sought to show its good faith and to avoid creating financial difficulties for Jamie Sinnott and his family, while carrying out its duty to establish legal certainty in this very important area of constitutional law.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in the education of children with severe-profound disabilities since the O'Donoghue judgment. It may be helpful in dispelling some of the confusion and misrepresentation surrounding this issue if I outline some of the facts.</P>
    <P>As a result of a decision of this Government children with severe-profound disabilities are now entitled to provision in special dedicated schools or in special dedicated classes attached to schools. Each special class now operates at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class has the support of two special needs assistants. The pupils now attract a special annual capitation funding rate of £447 per child. In addition, funding is provided for the purchase of specialised materials-equipment. The pupils are transported to/from school on the special schools transport service where each bus has the services of an escort.</P>
    <P>My Department has now provided for the establishment of a total of 122 special classes to date to cater specifically for children with severe-profound general learning disabilities. Further such classes are established as needs are identified. The current level of provision involves: 122 special class teachers with an approximate annual salary cost of £3 million; 244 special needs assistants with an approximate annual salary cost of £3.7 million and a special capitation funding of £327,000.</P>
    <P>Detailed costings are not available on the cost of special transport for these children as they can share routes with other disability groups.</P>
    <P>This Government has made more progress than any previous administration in the provision of access to and benefit from education for children with severe-profound disabilities. Much work remains to be done. Given the low base from which we as a society started in the mid-1990s and the complexity of putting in place a comprehensive education system for these children it could hardly be otherwise. We are addressing the issues now in a concerted way and the appeal in the Sinnott case, however decided, will not affect the much greater education provision which is now being made for children with severe-profound disabilities, our plans for the development of that provision or my commitment to the education of such children.</P>
    <P>A planning group was established in my Department in October 1999 to review the overall provision of special education services. The <Col N="1409" /> remit of the group was: to make recommendations to the Minister on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of the education system for students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The group reported to me in December 2000. The recommendations in the report provide a sound blueprint for the development of special education services and I have asked my Department to develop proposals for Government to advance the measures recommended by the planning group as a matter of high priority.</P>
    <P>In October 1998 my Department formally recognised the distinct educational needs of children with autism. This resulted in the establishment of dedicated provision to cater for these children in special schools or in special classes attached to ordinary schools. A total of 78 such classes have been established to date. The level of staffing and funding support provided to these children-classes is identical to that provided for children with severe-profound handicap. The overall annual cost of these 78 classes is estimated at £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>In October, 2000 I announced a new package of support services for children with autism. This included: the development of a nationwide pre-school service for children with autism; a doubling of the level of special needs assistant support from one to two in all classes for children with autism, and the extension of education services for children with autism through the month of July. I have secured funding of £5.5 million to implement this package.</P>
    <P>Equality of access to, participation in and benefit from education is my key policy approach and that of my Department. We are working to achieve that as fast as possible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the provision of speech therapy services for children in school, my Department works in close co-operation with the health authorities who have responsibility for the delivery of such services.</P>
      <P>I am arranging for my officials to bring the particular case to which the Deputy refers to the attention of the relevant health board so that any necessary speech therapy support can be made available to the child in question.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been ongoing difficulties in relation to the delivery of adequate speech therapy services to children in some schools. I have brought my concerns in this regard to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon to undertake a workforce planning study on therapeutic services, including speech and language therapies. The Higher Education Authority is represented on the steering group for the study and I understand that a report is expected in the near future.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, in response to the shortage of speech and language therapists, the intake into the programme at Trinity College, Dublin has been increased from 26 to 29 for the current academic year.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to liaise with the Department of Health and Children on this matter and will give positive consideration to any recommendations in relation to the training of additional speech therapists which may arise from the work being conducted by Dr. Bacon.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 657 to 659, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There are currently 42 cases listed before the High Court relating to actions taken by the parents or guardians of individuals who have been diagnosed as autistic.</P>
      <P>I regard it as unacceptable that any parent, and particularly a parent of a child with special needs, should find it necessary to resort to litigation to secure their child's educational entitlements. While this Government has presided over an unprecedented level of improvement in special education services, I am aware that much work remains to be done.</P>
      <P>A key development in this regard is the recent report of the planning group established in my Department to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of high quality co-ordinated services at all stages of education for students with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations brought forward by the planning group provide a valuable blueprint for the development of an efficient and effective <Col N="1413" /> special education service which will remove the need for parents to have to resort to litigation to secure their entitlements. It is my intention to seek Government approval to proceed with these measures at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In the past five years, 36 cases involving children with autism have been settled or adjourned generally on the basis of provision put in place for the individuals concerned. The following table details the total amount of agreed damages/settlements and legal costs paid in respect of these cases over that period.</P>

    <P>The pupil can be incidentally accommodated on a service which passes his school. The family appear to be unhappy with this service in view of the waiting time before and after school.</P>
    <P>As an alternative, my Department has offered the family a remote area grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements from their home to the school. Based on the mileage involved, the grant would amount to £2.60 per day.</P>

      <P>There are two programmes under which a qualifying adult may return to full-time education while continuing to receive income support. The first is the vocational training opportunities scheme which is administered by the Department of Education and Science. The second is the back to education programme, which is administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Both schemes are open to adults aged over 21 years and in receipt of an unemployment payment, one parent family payment, and other eligible categories, for at least six months. Participants cease to receive their social welfare payments and are instead paid an allowance at a standard rate, that is maximum rate of their current social welfare payment. The allowance includes increases for a qualified adult and child or children where applicable.</P>
      <P>Earnings from part-time employment or summer work do not affect the basic VTOS/BTEA payment. However, all income earned by the student and/or spouse/partner is assessable for rent or mortgage supplement purposes.</P>
      <P>There is no fee for a VTOS course and materials are provided free of charge. A training bonus of £25 per week is also paid to VTOS participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, that is 12 months. Time spent on the programme is not reckonable for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned in this case commenced the junior certificate programme in September 2000 with a view to taking the examination in June 2001. It would then be open to her to take the leaving certificate programme in the academic year 2001/02 under VTOS. Funds are also provided by my Department to vocational education <Col N="1418" /> committees to provide child care support for VTOS participants under certain conditions.</P>

      <P>In the organisation of the school transport system, buses are normally required to operate a number of runs. This is to provide a basic level of service, while achieving optimum value from resources available. To facilitate the operation of these services, children may be required to wait some time, both morning and evening, for their service. This is a feature of the school transport scheme, as operated throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Essentially, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary schools to arrange adequate supervision and insurance cover for children while they are on the school premises. Subject to the authority of the board of management, it is the responsibility of the principal teacher to organise and participate in the effective supervision of pupils during breaks, lunch periods, assembly and dismissal.</P>

      <P>A sum £550 million is being provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 towards research, technological development and innovation in the third level sector. The aim of the education RTDI, which is partially co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund, is to support the development of a world class research environment in higher education in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The education RTDI comprises four sub-measures, namely: basic support for research and electronic communications, project based and individual research, technological sector research and strategic research, including North-South co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £550 million is targeted primarily at publicly funded third level institutions including universities and institutes of technology. In view of the wide geographical spread of such institutions, most areas of the country will benefit directly from education RTDI funding. In addition, this substantial investment in third level research will increase the availability of highly skilled researchers in the labour force and will provide greater scope for collaboration on research between education and other sectors of the economy. This in turn will contribute to economic <Col N="1420" /> growth and will lead to benefits for all areas of the country.</P>
    <P>Balanced regional development and collaboration between the third level sector and industry are at the heart of the measures provided for in the national development plan. The designation of the country into two regions, border, midland and west and southern and eastern aims to achieve more balanced development by increasing the presence in each region of the key drivers of sustainable economic growth. The measures under the education RTDI complement a wide range of other measures under the productive sector operational programme and indeed, measures under other NDP operational programmes. My Department is working closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to strengthen research capacity, to promote collaboration between industry and the third level sector and to ensure maximum benefits for the economy and society generally.</P>

      <P>The scheme of aid towards the cost of school books for necessitous pupils at second level operates in secondary schools in the free education scheme, and in vocational, community and comprehensive schools. The terms of the scheme are the same for each category of school.</P>
      <P>A necessitous pupil, for the purposes of the scheme, is defined as a pupil from a family in which genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as alcoholism, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Each year schools and vocational education committees furnish to my Department general details of the number of necessitous pupils assisted in the previous year. Based on these returns the grant is paid by my Department to the individual secondary, community and comprehensive schools and to vocational education committees in respect of vocational schools.</P>
      <P>Principal teachers administer the scheme in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the scheme, based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. The monetary value of the aid given to necessitous pupils varies. Subject to the terms of the scheme, principals have discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted and the level of assistance in each case. The means by which such assistance is to be provided by schools to necessitous pupils, for example, financial assistance, vouchers or provision of books on loan or otherwise, is a matter for individual school authorities.</P>
      <P>In 2000 a total of £4.552 million was allocated in aid towards the cost of school books for necessitous pupils at second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the sensitive, responsive and resourceful manner in which the management <Col N="1423" /> and staff of schools, particularly principals, operate the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the alleviation of entry fees for the State examinations, the position is that for examinations due to be held in the year 2001, students who are covered by the medical card scheme, either directly or as the dependants of medical card holders are not liable to pay fees.</P>
    <P>My priority is to target those most in need of assistance and the available funding is concentrated on the removal of fees for those covered by the medical card scheme, who are generally recognised as the most disadvantaged in society.</P>
    <P>In future years, and as resources permit, it may be possible to extend the exemption further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from £45 per pupil in 1997 to £75.50 per pupil that this school year. In addition, a rate of £80 per pupil will apply in the 2001-02 school year. This constitutes an increase of approximately 77% over that period.</P>
      <P>My Department also operates a devolved grant scheme to enable minor works to be carried out to national school properties. Payment is made every school year at a rate of £3,000 per school plus £10 per pupil. The scheme is intended to cover minor improvements to school buildings and grounds, replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of furniture and the provision of floor coverings and blinds. If there are no outstanding works to be undertaken at the school under these headings, the school authorities may expend the grant on items of equipment such as computers, overhead projectors and photocopiers. Subject to compliance with the terms of the scheme, expenditure of the grant is entirely at the discretion of the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past three years, my Department has also provided grant assistance to schools to meet <Col N="1424" /> their running costs by means other than the capitation grant or the minor works grant. For instance, in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking assistance to schools, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, almost 2,300 primary schools will receive supplementary grants for the next three years under the major new programme entitled Giving Children An Even Break, recently launched by me to address educational disadvantage. The amount of supplementary grant aid payable to each school at the rate of £50 per disadvantaged pupil is based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the school. These were identified through a comprehensive survey conducted on my Department's behalf by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, during 2000.</P>
    <P>Last year, I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Under the terms of this grant, all schools designated as disadvantaged plus schools in the rural phase of the breaking the cycle scheme will receive an annual grant of £1,000 per school while all other schools will receive £500 per school.</P>
    <P>Under my Department's IT 2000 programme, and since 1998, grants in excess of £13.1 million have been paid in respect of the educational IT equipment and software needs of ordinary national schools, special schools and special needs classes.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ongoing annual commitments I outlined earlier, my Department has also issued a number of other grants to schools over the past three years to assist them with the purchase of various resources. These grants include a library grant in December 1998, a science grant and an infants grant in October 1999, a national reading initiative grant in December 1999, a visual arts grant in November 2000 and a curriculum grant for arts in November 2000. The total value of these grants amounts to approximately £19.5 million.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate, in light of the information I have supplied, that sub<Col N="1425" /> stantial improvements have been made to the level of grant aid that has been made available by this Government to primary schools to meet their day-to-day operating costs.</P>

      <P>The new NEPS agency as proposed came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. It is also intended to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>

      <P>The planning group for the national educational psychological service agency included two representatives of the Department of Health and Children. In addition, its advisory technical working group included two psychologists from the health sector.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations in the planning group report was: &ldquo;That a national educational psychological service should be well integrated in the education system as a whole but be co-ordinated with psychological and related services in the health sector.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This co-ordination is being effected at national, regional and local level. At national level, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards are represented on the manage<Col N="1429" /> ment committee and on the national policy advisory board of NEPS. The voluntary bodies that provide services to children with disabilities are also represented on the national policy advisory board. Their contribution to these committees has been most valuable. The representative of the Department of Health and Children has unfortunately had to resign from the management committee but steps are being taken to secure a replacement.</P>
    <P>The management committee has established a joint NEPS-health board working party to examine and make recommendations about practical issues in relation to referral and assessment of children. This working party is expected to report in September. It is being advised by an internal NEPS survey of best practice in terms of effective liaison.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure effective co-ordination at regional level, NEPS is organised in ten regions equivalent to the ten health board regions. As part of the roll out of NEPS, a number of assistant regional directors will be appointed each year until ten are in post. One of the major responsibilities of each assistant director will be to ensure effective liaison with the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>At local level, a series of meetings is being held with the voluntary bodies that provide services to children with disabilities, in order to agree on the respective roles and responsibilities of NEPS psychologists and the psychologists employed by the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Psychologists in the Department of Education and Science have always worked closely with their colleagues in the health sector in relation to individual children and this practice continues.</P>

      <P>My Department has contacted Cork Corporation on this matter and it is understood the student, referred to by the Deputy, has been assessed as being eligible for a local authority higher education maintenance grant for the current academic year, 2000-01. The processing of the grant application cannot be finalised until confirmation is received from University College Cork that the student is a registered full-time student in the current academic year. It is further understood that her college registration cannot <Col N="1430" /> be effected until her tuition fees in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year are paid.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that the student holds a Higher Diploma in Social Policy and commenced a two year masters course in social work at University College Cork in 1999. The higher education grants scheme which applied to the 1999-2000 academic year precluded grants being awarded to candidates who already held a postgraduate qualification and were pursuing a second postgraduate qualification. Accordingly, the student in question was deemed ineligible for a higher education grant in respect of the 1999-2000 academic year.</P>
      <P>Last October I amended the student support schemes to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment is operative from the current academic year, 2000-01 and, accordingly, the student in question is eligible to receive a grant for maintenance and fees, in respect of the current academic year, provided the other conditions in the grant scheme as to means etc. are fulfilled.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to give retrospective effect to this amendment to cover academic years prior to 2000-01.</P>

      <P>At junior certificate level the science syllabus places significant emphasis on student practical work and on the practical skills that should be acquired by a student on completion of the course. The syllabus consists of a core and five extensions. One of these extensions is local studies and it requires students to carry out a practical project. This project is assessed by external examiners at the end of the course. The local studies extension is taken by a minority of students. For the majority, practical work consists primarily of short experiments/investigations carried out at the laboratory bench. This work is assessed by means of suitable questions on the written paper. The junior certificate science syllabus is currently being reviewed by a course committee of the national council for curriculum and assessment. While the revised syllabus is likely to have a somewhat different structure, it will continue to have a particular emphasis on student practical work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> At leaving certificate level the three main science subjects are physics, chemistry and biology. They all place an emphasis on student practical work as an integral part of the course. Last September new syllabi in physics and chemistry were introduced to schools for first examination in June 2002. Both of these new syllabi have an increased emphasis on student practical work and both have lists of required student experiments. A revised syllabus in biology has also been recently completed. Again, student practical work is an inherent part of the course and a range of required student practical work is included in the syllabus. In all three subjects, practical work is currently assessed through the medium of suitable questions on the written examination paper.</P>
    <P>Syllabi in the two minority leaving certificate science subjects, physics and chemistry combined and agricultural science, are currently under review. Both syllabi currently include practical work as an inherent part of the course and the revised syllabi will also pay particular attention to this aspect of the subjects. The agricultural science syllabus also includes a practical project which is assessed as part of the leaving certificate examination, while practical work in the physics and chemistry course is assessed through the medium of the written paper.</P>
    <P>A feasibility study into alternative modes of practical assessment in physics and chemistry has been carried out by my Department and the NCCA. The results of this study, and the various issues relating to the possible introduction of practical assessment in all of the leaving certificate science subjects, are under active consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>A programme of inservice training for teachers and additional capital funding for laboratories has been put in place to promote and support the development of practical work in the teaching of the physical sciences.</P>
    <P>In April 2000 schools received a capital grant of £4,000. Of this sum, £1,500 was designated for the purchase of basic laboratory equipment while the remainder was designated for the purchase of a computer and associated hardware and software specifically for use in the science laboratory. At the end of last year schools received a further capital grant of £6,500. This was intended primarily for the purchase of data logging equipment.</P>
    <P>As well as these capital grants, an additional annual <i>per capita</i> grant for each student studying the physical sciences at leaving certificate level was introduced in the school year 1999-2000.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive programme of inservice training for teachers of physics and chemistry was instituted in September 1999. The programme will run for three years at an estimated cost of £3 million. In the current year the major emphasis of <Col N="1432" /> the programme is on the development of student practical work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Since September 1999, preparations for the introduction of science, as part of social environment and scientific education in the revised primary school curriculum, have been under way. During the 1999-2000 school year, a number of supports were provided for schools: the science curriculum and teacher guidelines were disseminated to all primary teachers; a total of £1.7 million in the form of grants was made available to schools for the purchase of science equipment; a school development planning initiative was launched to assist schools in curriculum planning; and a comprehensive programme of courses for teachers in primary science was run during the summer of 2000.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, a developmental project in science was initiated in a representative sample of schools through the primary curriculum support programme, which is charged with the organisation of incareer development programmes to support the implementation of all subjects within the primary school curriculum. This developmental project is designed to familiarise teachers with the approaches, methodologies and materials used in the teaching of science, and to build capacity towards the implementation of science throughout the primary school system. The developmental project will continue in the school year 2001-02 and in September 2002, a national incareer development programme for all primary teachers will be organised. The implementation of science in all primary schools will begin from September 2003.</P>
      <P>As is the case with all subjects in the revised primary school curriculum, schools may commence the implementation of science in advance of the formal incareer development programme if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, science is taught as a single subject in the junior cycle and as five separate subjects in the senior cycle. They are biology, physics, chemistry, agricultural science and the combined subject of physics and chemistry. In the junior cycle the uptake of science has remained fairly constant for a number of years at just under 90% of the cohort. At senior cycle the uptake of agricultural science has been increasing somewhat, albeit from a fairly low base. The uptake of biology has been decreas<Col N="1433" /> ing in recent years, while the uptake of the physical sciences has been on the decrease for a number of years.</P>
    <P>In the context of initiatives to increase the uptake of the physical science subjects at second level my Department is implementing a range of measures that are designed to make these subjects more attractive to students.</P>
    <P>Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 for first examination in June 2002. As well as the addition of new, up to date content these syllabi have an increased emphasis on student practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society. These changes are intended to highlight for students the relevance of these subjects to their everyday lives.</P>
    <P>A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science was introduced in last year's examination. In leaving certificate physics and chemistry the structure and layout of questions on the ordinary level papers has been revised. These changes have been designed to make these examination papers more accessible to the cohort of candidates for whom they are intended.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive incareer development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was put in place in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years. During the first year of the programme a total of two and a half days of inservice training was provided for teachers of physics and for teachers of chemistry. The programme has continued in the current school year with a particular emphasis on practical work. The programme has received a very enthusiastic response from teachers and will make a major contribution to reinvigorating the teaching of these subjects at both junior and senior level.</P>
    <P>The incareer development programme includes the provision of support materials for teachers. In addition to these materials my Department has produced comprehensive reference handbooks in both physics and chemistry and has distributed them to all second level schools. These handbooks have been provided in both printed and CD-ROM formats. In addition to the copies sent to schools individual teachers are being provided with further copies of the CD as part of the incareer development programme. These materials have a particular emphasis on practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society.</P>
    <P>In April 2000 schools offering the physical sciences received a capital grant of £4000. Of this, £1,500 was designated for the purchase of basic laboratory equipment while the remainder was designated for the purchase of a computer and associated hardware and software specifically for use in the science laboratory. At the end of last <Col N="1434" /> year schools received a further capital grant of £6,500. This was intended primarily for the purchase of data logging equipment.</P>
    <P>As well as these capital grants, an additional annual <i>per capita</i> grant for each student studying the physical sciences at leaving certificate level was introduced in the school year 1999/2000.</P>
    <P>I have recently set up a task force on the uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third level. The brief of the task force is to devise and recommend additional measures to improve participation rates in physics, chemistry and related courses at second and third level. The task force has met three times to date and, following an advertisement in the national press, has received submissions from some 40 institutions and individuals. Two full-time national science strategy co-ordinators have been appointed to assist the task force in its work. The co-ordinators, who are from second and third level respectively, have taken up their positions from 1 March 2001. It is expected that the task force will produce an interim report within a few months and a final report in about a year.</P>
