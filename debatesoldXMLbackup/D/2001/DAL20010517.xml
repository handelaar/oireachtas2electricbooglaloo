      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Joe Higgins. I call on Deputy Higgins to state the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Under Standing Order 31, I seek leave to move a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil on a specific and important matter of public interest which requires urgent consideration, that is, the imprisonment of anti-refuse tax campaigners in Cork, the contrast between their treatment and the amnesties given to wealthy tax evaders in 1988 and 1993, the need to implement an effective waste management strategy which is properly funded by the Exchequer and does not involve refuse charges and the need to immediately release those imprisoned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am asking about &ndash; I think you will appreciate it, a Cheann Comhairle &ndash; is that today is the anniversary of the worse atrocity ever committed on this island, the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and, on account of the death of <Col N="831" /> the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, there has been some delay in the commitments the Taoiseach gave about referring this to the committee of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter to establish on the Order of Business proper. It is totally out of order at this stage to do so. The Deputy is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to establish if the Taoiseach is making arrangements to ensure that the commitments given that this would be referred to a committee of the House are still in place before&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question should wait until we come to the proper time on the Order of Business to do so. It is not in order at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but if I got an unsatisfactory answer, I would oppose the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is reasonable to ask the Taoiseach what is his position before I decide whether I will vote against it. Surely that is a reasonable approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can wait until the Order of Business to do that but at this stage the only question before the House is on the membership of a committee and it has nothing to do with what the Deputy is raising at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, you are misunderstanding me. One of the groups of people in this country which is most concerned about events in the past is the relatives of those who were murdered in Dublin and Monaghan in that bombing campaign. They are very concerned that sufficient progress is not being made. On the anniversary I would make this an issue on which to oppose the Order of Business but I believe the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is Leaders' Questions and the Order of Business proper in which to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>But we always had a situation in the House, which you yourself have operated, a Cheann Comhairle, where questions like this on matters of concern throughout the House and in all parties are allowed at your discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it will be allowed. I am saying that if the Deputy wishes to raise it under Leaders' Questions or on the Order of Business proper, he may do so and I am pointing that out to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And there will be two more. To enable this House to agree to the Order of Business, before we give our assent &ndash; we cannot revoke our assent after they have been agreed &ndash; we wanted to clarify a number of points. We have used that device quite regularly, with your agreement. Precedent is well established. We could have the matter dealt with by now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring to the Taoiseach's attention the very important fact that the decommissioning regulation expires next Tuesday. Has this Government given up or is it just through incompetence that it has not been laid before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the Order of Business, but I believe the Taoiseach's reply may put me in <Col N="833" /> a position where I can agree the Order of Business. I simply want a reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of this motion re membership of committees, Mr. Justice Barron has continued his work. He has been engaged in discussions with the Northern Ireland Office, the RUC and the British Government, to obtain additional documents. That work is ongoing. He has extended the scope of his work by continuing the excellent work of the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton. It will take him some time. There has not been any delay in the work, rather he has extended the scope of the work. The intention is that when that work is finished, his report will be sent to the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify a point, Sir, before we agree to that alteration in the Order of Business. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has failed to place an order before this House to renew the regulations relating to the Decommissioning Act, which expire next Tuesday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday at a conference of IMPACT, the Tánaiste expressed concern about the future of the PPF and seemed to cast doubt on its future. I am not surprised at that because wage inflation is running at four times the EU average, and inflation in the cost of food has gone up by 7.7%, which is the highest in 17 years. This is putting huge pressure on the trade union movement to look for wage increases beyond the terms of the PPF. Why does the Taoiseach think the <Col N="834" /> measures taken in the budget to control inflation are not working? Does he agree with the Tánaiste that the PPF is now at risk and what steps does he intend to take to ensure that everything committed in the PPF will be delivered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow a supplementary question from Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to what Deputy Noonan has said, does the Taoiseach share the view expressed by the general secretary of IMPACT, the largest public service union? He said that while social partnership has played a very positive role in the past, the premise on which social partnership was originally based was the reduction in tax to bring about moderate increases in wages and salaries in order to restore competitiveness and increase employment. That premise has come to its natural end and a new kind of structure is required which would result in the improvement of public services, and that should be the basis for the next round of agreements within the framework of the social partnership. I know the view of the Tánaiste is quite different in that she wants to effectively abolish tax, and therefore, public services along with it. Does the Taoiseach have a differing view to that of the Progressive Democrats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to complete the answer to the question I was asked earlier about the decommissioning regulations. They have been extended and signed up to next February. They can be laid before the House if this is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand they must be signed by next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been signed. In reply to the Leader's Question from Deputy Noonan, the Tánaiste did not attend the IMPACT conference yesterday. Therefore, whatever he is quoting could not be correct. She could not have said anything if she was not there.</P>
      <P>The Government's policies on the pay increases and tax under the PPF, are enormous increases, and that is acknowledged by the social partners. The changes of 4 December 2000 have proved effective. Inflation is still higher than the Government would wish. We will continue to do our utmost to enforce the measures. The latest price increases in the food and drink area have put upward pressure on inflation. The increase in meat prices is connected to the foot and mouth disease crisis and this House has debated the drinks sector on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been dealing with regulatory authorities in relation to competition. There is a preliminary report on the off-licence trade. We are looking at other reports. We are anxious to make progress on the issue of competition. We must try to control inflation in other areas because it is higher than it was at the last budget. I reiterate that the increases in the PPF <Col N="835" /> are substantial when tax and pay are taken together. They are far in excess of our commitments and we will continue to honour the aspects of PPF.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, each programme beginning with the first programme 14 years ago, has gone through an evolution. Each programme from <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, PCW, PPF, Partnership 2000, have all been evolving. There are always new issues to be considered, based on the circumstances of the economy at any given time. The big issue during the 1980s in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> programme and the PCW, was the fact that we had a debt GDP ratio of 117%. We were paying enormous amounts of debt interest. We do not have that problem now. We now have one of the lowest debts in the European Community at an interest of only 33% and going to 25% in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Employment was the issue in the Partnership 2000 discussions, with an unemployment rate of 17%, and now we are at 3.5% while long-term unemployment is at 1%.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with different difficulties now, infrastructural issues. This programme is dealing with many of those issues. Substantive parts of this programme are dealing with health issues. The Government had a discussion on the bed-capacity review earlier this week and this derives directly from PPF. The housing forum derives directly from the PPF. The Government will continue to deal with these and other issues. I have no doubt that when a new programme is negotiated we will again look at its evolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>Deputy Noonan may ask a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that according to the Revenue Commissioners, 52% of taxpayers have gross incomes of less than £15,000 per year. That is more than half the work force. An 8% increase in the cost of food is devastating for those people. These are the very people who have gained very little out of the manner in which the Minister for Finance has managed tax cuts. Low income and middle income people got very little. People want a new social contract, a new deal between the citizens and the State, which will guarantee them access to good health services, equal opportunity in education, an assurance of care in their old age, a Government which addresses the housing crisis and contributes somewhat to the quality of life by easing the traffic chaos in cities like Dublin.</P>

      <P>I can only briefly repeat a few of the points made here by the Minister for Finance during the past two nights on Private Members' Business. This Government's policy <Col N="836" /> has been to take the low paid in society out of the tax net altogether,&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;to introduce a minimum wage and to work towards taking everybody on the minimum wage out of the tax net. There have been enormous increases in child benefit this year. There will be increases in the next two years, as happened in the past few years. Most people in these difficulties are now working. If we can succeed in taking the low paid out of the tax net, not to mention that 78% of those who pay tax are already on the standard rate, these are the kinds of improvements that are helping those on low pay. That is not taking from the fact that there is still a difficulty with inflation on which the Government is working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware there are 7,500 people on Dublin Corporation's housing list. He has two brothers who are members of that local authority and he was previously Lord Mayor. The State is proposing to sell by public tender on 14 June, 13.6 acres of land adjacent to a railway line at Islandbridge. I asked yesterday, Sir, if the State would address the problem of housing and make this land available to Dublin Corporation. I did not say &ldquo;Give it to Dublin Corporation, make it available&rdquo;. The Minister for Defence in his wisdom volunteered the following, that it had been offered to Dublin Corporation. I made inquiries as to what an offer from the Department of Defence actually means. I was informed that it was offered at £45 million. It then came down to around £30 million. The Taoiseach and certain people in his Department will be aware that the largest single site to come on sale in the Dublin area, adjacent to the Tara Towers Hotel &ndash; the Sisters of Charity lands of approximately 14.5 acres, virgin land without any encumbrances, fully serviced, with no preservations buildings on it &ndash;  was sold for £37 million. Property analysts with whom I spoke this morning say the property is worth of the order of £20 million and that 350 units of accommodation could be provided and along the lines of that suggested by the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Howlin, that could be an integrated social mix of local authority and affordable housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of that factual information and refuting the misleading comments which the Minister for Defence put on the record yesterday, I formally ask the Government, on behalf of every member of Dublin Corporation who is a Member of the Oireachtas, which is awash with money to enter into an arrangement now to enable Dublin Corporation to have this land so that some dent can be made on the housing list of 7,500 people, some of whom will never be able <Col N="837" /> to afford a house and will not be housed by Dublin Corporation at least for the next ten years. Between now and 14 June will it knock some sense into the two Departments to make this a place where families who cannot afford to buy houses can get houses from Dublin Corporation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach who is going into his fifth year in office that he is losing touch with the concerns of ordinary people. If he had any appreciation of the housing crisis not only in Dublin but all around the country he would be acting or causing his Minister for the Environment and Local Government to act. The Taoiseach may be aware that two nights ago an event in Limerick where local authority tenants were handed out keys for 25 houses was recorded as a major national news story on the Six One News on television. When the handing out of 25 keys to local authority tenants is a major event I put it to the Taoiseach that he is totally out of touch and should sack his Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can make two brief points and try to answer Deputy Quinn's question. I have to repeat that record levels of new housing output have been achieved. There has been a trebling of resources in the area of housing. This year there are about 7,000 local authority houses. As the members Dublin Corporation will be aware some of these houses in the Dublin area cost in excess of £150,000. The qual<Col N="838" /> ity and standard of the housing is newsworthy, though I do not decide what is newsworthy.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Clancy Barracks which Deputy Quinn raised yesterday, in July 1998 when the Minister for Defence made it clear he was selling the barracks, the Department also made it known to the county councils and corporation. From a long way back there were discussions between the corporation and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Generally the Department of the Environment and Local Government liaise with the Department of Defence and local authorities on land disposals to ensure that the relevant local authority is aware of the sale and examines the land for suitability for housing developments. It does that as a matter of form. The Deputy mentioned yesterday that Naas UDC acquired Army lands and barracks for housing development. There is also an integrated area plan for Murphy Barracks in Ballincollig in Cork. Whatever happens ultimately at Clancy Barracks, the required 20% social and affordable housing under Part 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act will take effect.</P>
      <P>I have a long list of all the facts and I was briefed on this matter last evening. There was a valuation, but that was not the issue, on 24 March. The Valuation Office valued the property in the region of £40 million but it never got into the discussion between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Defence on the money issue because last summer the Department of the Environment and Local Government indicated that the corporation's view was that the acquisition of the barracks for redevelopment by the corporation to provide social housing did not offer an attractive proposition and that the public interest would be best served from a housing and planning point of view by the Department offering the property for sale in the open market because of the limited capacity to provide low rise housing. It went on for a long time before that. As I understand it the corporation probably formed its view. Since the Deputy mentioned my brother, the Lord Mayor, I spoke to him about this issue last night. He said that, perhaps Dublin Corporation was anxious to acquire the property for a mixture of social and affordable housing but it indicated that the barracks contained a number of listed buildings which would pose for Dublin Corporation enormous architectural problems in matching up the old with the new. That was the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It never came down to the question of the money. Equally, can I say &ndash; and it is important for the corporation and I have spoken to the Ministers about this &ndash; where there are suitable sites of enormous value the Department of the Environment and Local Government is prepared to pay enormous values to get sites in the greater Dublin area which is what it is doing. <Col N="839" /> It is prepared to do that and hopefully will continue to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. There is a contradiction in the Valuation Office putting a value of £40 million on a site that is, according to the Taoiseach's information, so constricted by planning restrictions that it is not possible to get a satisfactory architectural solution to it. Beggars Bush Barracks, which was a listed building, was successfully converted by Dublin Corporation and, as Deputy Eoin Ryan can attest, is now providing very satisfactory accommodation for senior citizens. It is not necessary to use market mechanisms of valuation because this all arises from an imposition by the Department of Finance on the Department of Defence that it has to maximise the value of its assets in order to re-fund and re-equip the Army. The Department of Finance got a windfall profit this year&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Department of Finance got a windfall profit this year of approximately £225 million from the sale of ICC on top of the end of year proceeds? As a former Lord Mayor, can he not agree that the real problem for Dublin Corporation is that they cannot acquire land? Of the 600 houses they will build this year, 300 will be purchased from other builders. Any one of the Fíanna Fáil councillors will tell him that the corporation cannot acquire land quickly and efficiently. There are 7,500 people on the waiting list. I call on the Taoiseach to stop this madness between the two Departments, remove this property from public sale and enter into negotiations. Having spoken to officials today, I can confirm that Dublin Corporation will take this property. No elected member of Dublin Corporation was informed of the facts that were put on the record by the Taoiseach today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the first point that the Deputy made. The corporation is having difficulty obtaining sites, even where it is prepared to pay high prices. In order to build social housing we should pay those prices if necessary. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is liaising not only with the Department of Defence but also with other Departments and local authorities on land disposal. I support that.</P>
      <P>On his second point, it was not a money issue. I have discussed this with the Minister and I have looked at the entire brief on it.</P>

I understood the Taoiseach to say, although the official record might not have shown it, the necessary regulation under the Decommissioning Act, 1997, to extend from 2000 to 2001 and from 2001 onwards had been signed. Our understanding, under section 3 (7) of the legislation, is that the order in question has to be laid before this House. It does not have to be debated but it is an annulling resolution. From our records over recent days, we cannot find such an order in the green Order of Business.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am delighted to be back here once more with legislation on the horse and greyhound racing industries. As is well known, these are subjects which are very close to my heart but, some might suggest, not so good for my health &ndash; financial or physical &ndash; when I get a run of bad luck. That said, I enjoy the sports as do many more in this House. The excitement of both horse and greyhound racing and the punting that goes with it is hard to match. However, it is not for that reason that we are now giving this area our attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before and I reiterate it here, the Government considers racing to be strategically important because of the employment it creates and sustains at all levels and the significant contribution it makes to rural development, farm and other incomes, the business and services sectors, tourism, the economy as a whole and the international reputation of the State. There are approximately 30,000 people gainfully employed, either directly or indirectly, in these industries <Col N="848" /> and racing makes a significant contribution to the buoyant £1 billion off-course betting market. There is scarcely a town or village in the country that does not benefit in some way from these activities.</P>
    <P>Despite its size, Ireland is recognised as one of the leading countries in the world for the production of quality thoroughbred horses and greyhounds. Ireland is an attractive location for many foreigners to breed, own and race horses. Our soil and climate are ideal for the purpose and not only do Irish people have a great love of the horse and greyhound but there is also a breadth and depth of innate skills and experience in the breeding, handling, rearing and training of these often extremely valuable animals. This combination could scarcely be matched elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The production side of the business is showing healthy growth. On horses, for instance, the last five years has seen a 23% increase in the number of thoroughbreds being registered annually with a similar increase in the number of runners. The gross value of our thoroughbred sales has more than doubled in that time. I want to give great credit for this to the efforts of IHA company &ndash; Irish Thoroughbred Marketing. In the past year alone, ITM has conducted an unprecedented number of promotional visits to 25 established or potential markets for Irish thoroughbreds. It has set up an excellent website on the Internet and distributes information on Irish horses to more than 2,500 contacts in 64 countries. As a result, more than 1,000 foreign buyers availed of its inward buyer programme by purchasing at public sales here last year. All its targets have been far surpassed. There has been a huge increase in percentage terms in customers for our horses coming from Australia, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Tunisia and potential growth to be experienced in the trade to Turkey. Of the emerging markets, Spain and Greece are showing great promise and other countries which offer serious potential include China, Korea, Saudi Arabia and South America.</P>
    <P>ITM is also strongly promoting racehorse ownership in Ireland. More than 700 new owners were introduced to Irish racing in 2000 as a result. One syndicate at least was made up of both Houses of the Oireachtas and their purchase, Arctic Copper, did them proud during the year. One of the many things the new guaranteed funding for the industry being proposed in the Bill will facilitate is the continued and planned resourcing of ITM and its valuable activities.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been regarded as the home of the best racing greyhounds. However, when the racing sector was in decline here for lack of investment in and promotion of the sport, there was a serious knock-on effect on the breeding front. Since the home industry has been rejuvenated over the past five years or so, prices for our quality greyhounds have risen and our markets have opened up again. We export Irish greyhounds to the UK, the US, Australia and many European countries. Nevertheless, there remains <Col N="849" /> a very big job of work to be done in developing existing markets and exploring new ones.</P>
    <P>I know Bord na gCon has a vision for the globalisation of greyhound racing and associated betting, with Ireland leading the process. It has started with participation in an international carnival in Australia where greyhound racing is very strong and there is a huge betting market. It is now turning its attentions to the US and will participate in planned new international races there next January. We have the quality in stock in greyhounds as much as in horses. We have the skills and the expertise. What we need is much more investment and planning coupled with aggressive marketing. The results will be improved returns for Irish breeders, owners, trainers and rolled out benefits for all those involved in or providing services to the industry.</P>
    <P>We have not been short in Ireland of world class thoroughbred horses and greyhounds and famous breeders, owners, trainers and jockeys whom we can rightly describe as legends in their own time. In 2000 alone, Irish-bred horses won 30 Group 1 races around the world. The highlights include the record-breaking performance of Sinndar who won the Irish Derby, the Epsom Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Istabraq's outstanding run at Cheltenham, Papillon's win in the Aintree Grand National and the Irish-trained Giants Causeway who ran in eight Group 1 races and won five. Just as, and some would say, even more important are the human heroes behind those horses &ndash; Aidan O'Brien, John Oxx, the family combinations of Ted and Ruby Walsh and another father and son combination, Tommy and Paul Carbery. I must mention also the legendary Vincent O'Brien who has been our most famous ambassador as a renowned trainer under both codes &ndash; national hunt and flat courses. Johnny Murtagh had a tremendous year altogether riding as he did 12 Group 1 winners and Mick Kinane came a close second with 11 such wins.</P>
    <P>Irish-bred and trained greyhounds have been winning consistently at home and abroad. Bord na gCon finds it difficult every year to choose their Hall of Fame Award winner, such is the large number of successful and extremely committed greyhound breeders, owners and trainers in the industry. This year I believe it goes to Pat Dalton, a Tipperary man, who would be as well known in the US as he is in Ireland for the extremely high quality of his greyhound breeding and racing on the international scene and is generally regarded as Ireland's leading ambassador world wide for the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the area of breeding and rearing horses and greyhounds and the people involved, I will say a few short words to record my thanks and appreciation of their co-operation and commitment having regard to the recent foot and mouth disease scare. The agriculture industry and the Irish economy has just come through one of the toughest and most difficult periods for many decades. Like all big challenges, if we rise to the <Col N="850" /> occasion we can defeat the problem and grow and learn significantly from the experience. Foot and mouth disease galvanised the country into extraordinary action on a single issue with one goal in sight. I am not saying the foot and mouth disease crisis is over and we cannot become complacent in our attitude to it. However, thanks to a great effort by all, we have been successful so far. I take this opportunity to congratulate and compliment the horse and greyhound people for their voluntary, enthusiastic and pro-active support for the necessary control measures and I acknowledge the difficulties created for them. The sacrifices they made for the overall good of farming and the economy were extraordinary and are much appreciated not only by me but by the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>If we had any doubts at all about the merits of the level of investment being proposed in the legislation for the horse and greyhound industries and whether it would represent value for money, we need only look at the performance of these industries over the past five years to see their capacity for growth and development. Attendances at horse racing have grown from approximately one million to more than 1.35 million people. On-course betting has jumped from £96 million to more than £160 million. Prize-money has shot up from £14 million to £25 million. In that context the contribution from sponsors and owners has also been increasing. I outlined earlier the consequential and significant growth achieved in the breeding and sales of thoroughbreds over the same period.</P>
    <P>Greyhound racing has seen proportionately an even faster rate of growth. Attendances there have grown from just over half a million to 900,000 people with the one million target expected to be broken this year. On-track betting has jumped from £23 million to more than £53 million. Prize money has more than doubled, rising from £1.9 million to £4 million. The contribution from sponsors for greyhound events here is also rising. Therefore, this is an opportune time to introduce legislation to put these industries on a stronger and more secure footing into the future. Despite the progress and growth, both sectors operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. The time has come to introduce some fundamental changes.</P>
    <P>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill, 2001, represents substantial changes in both structures and funding, which have been in the starting stalls for some time but are now finally at the off. On horseracing, it builds on the significant developments which took place in 1994, with the establishment of the IHA, and in 1999 when the first rearrangement of the financing of the industry was undertaken. Both of those initiatives which I brought forward were major improvements in their own right. But for those changes at the time, and the forward movement that followed on those developments, we might never have been able to achieve this final and critical phase of the restructuring of the horseracing industry. Given <Col N="851" /> the rapid and impressive growth achieved in the greyhound industry over the same period, we are also including Bord na gCon in the revised funding arrangements and this is well deserved.</P>
    <P>As is evidenced by the performance figures I have given for the horse and greyhound industries, the increased State investment in these sectors over the past few years has paid handsome dividends. The measures that were taken then and since, and the hard work and commitment of the people in the IHA and Bord na gCon, the Turf Club, the many representative organisations involved and the various participants in racing at all levels in the industries, all contributed to a good result. The new regime we are now putting in place will go on to yield even greater returns. I am delighted in these circumstances that the industries are united in this effort and I feel strongly that the cohesion created will underpin the industries for the long run and, together with the necessary guaranteed funding we are now providing, will allow both sectors to develop and grow to their real potential.</P>
    <P>I now come to the details of the Bill. The Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994, was an extensive stand alone piece of legislation which essentially replaced the Racing Board, that had been in existence since 1945, with the IHA. As many of the provisions of that Act could and should rightfully apply to the new body being established under this Bill, we decided to amend the 1994 Act to provide for the new situation and, as a consequence, we also had to amend parts of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, the Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Act, 1999, and the Betting Act, 1931. We have provided an explanatory memorandum for the Bill, which summarises all the major changes and then goes on to explain each section of the Bill and the consequential issues arising in some detail. I look forward to teasing out these issues out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the major points of policy involved. The Bill is essentially setting up a new body called Horse Racing Ireland, or HRI, to replace the IHA and take over certain functions from the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee. It was felt that there was an element of duplication of effort and resources between the IHA and the Turf Club. There were two completely separate and independent head office buildings and facilities, finance and accounting units, IT database management and data processing services, as well as personnel and management functions. There was a large body of opinion in the industry which held the same view as mine and that of the Minister for Finance that better efficiency of operation and cohesion generally could be achieved if at least all the main administrative and financial streams of the racing business could be brought together into one new body. This is what we are seeking to achieve with the establishment of HRI. From now on, all elements of the industry will <Col N="852" /> deal with one body in relation to their participation in racing and their financing arrangements.</P>
    <P>This comes about as a result of the transfer of the registry office functions from the Turf Club to HRI under section 8 of the Bill. HRI will retain all the functions currently carried out by the IHA. These include the authorisation of racecourses, the setting of fixtures, the control of on-course bookmakers and the general development and promotion of the industry and the Irish thoroughbred horse. The registry office functions which HRI will take over from the Turf Club will include the issuing of racing passports, handling race entries, making race declarations and holding and managing the race entry as well as prize money funds.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club will continue to be responsible for the critically important function of making and enforcing the rules of racing in every respect. This will protect the integrity of racing which the Turf Club has done for over 200 years and in respect of which it has a reputation second to none. These functions are set out in paragraph 6 of the Schedule to the Bill. The costs of integrity services will be met by HRI as they were by the IHA under the 1994 Act. Paragraph 8 of the Schedule inserts provision for an arbitration system to resolve any disputes on the budget for such services.</P>
    <P>Further functions which are being added to HRI's responsibility include providing support for the improvement of the health status of the Irish horse and the specialised education and training requirements of the sector. These are issues which have been raised here in the House several times and are very important to the future of the industry and, therefore, I felt that HRI, in its new and central role in that industry, should have a responsibility in these areas.</P>
    <P>Other than State and industry funding, the sale of the pictures and associated information on Irish race meetings is the one other key source of potentially high levels of revenue for the sector. The media rights were vested in the racecourses in the 1994 Act. However, it was felt that, because of the huge impact that the terms of any sale of racing pictures could have on the industry as a whole, it would be better if the negotiations on the sale of media rights in future were to be handled, serviced and funded by the State body which will now be directly representative of all the major interests in the industry. This was agreed by the Association of Irish Racecourses. Section 10 prescribes that the negotiations will be undertaken by a committee of HRI. The representative of the racecourses on the board of HRI will chair the committee and the Turf Club will have a member on the committee.</P>
    <P>However, racecourses will receive the full income from the sale of media rights for the next five years. After that, HRI will be obliged to negotiate with the racecourses how the income from this source, which by then will hopefully be much increased, might be distributed among the wider industry interests who are contributing to <Col N="853" /> Irish racing. In that context, HRI will be required to guarantee to the racecourses revenue from this source for each of the following five years which will at least equal the average annual income they got for the first five years.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club agreed that the property rights it had up to now in the information on runners and riders compiled by the registry office, can be immediately vested in HRI by this legislation, subject to a guarantee that the income over the next ten years will accrue to the Turf Club.</P>
    <P>Section 12 holds most of the financial implications of this legislation. Given the exceptional returns achieved over the past five years for the investment to date in the IHA and Bord na gCon and the huge potential for further improvements in this area, the Government feels that the case has already been well made for a permanent and guaranteed provision of State funding at a significantly increased level for these industries. The domestic horse and greyhound breeding and racing sectors are providing the raw material for the off-course betting market and deserve to receive some of the fruits of their labour in this regard.</P>
    <P>That is why we are proposing in the Bill that HRI and Bord na gCon will, between them, receive this year from the Exchequer, funds equivalent to the revenue generated from excise duty on off-course betting last year, which amounts to a total of about £46 million. This will be divided between the two bodies on a four to one basis, with HRI getting 80%, or roughly £37 million, and Bord na gCon getting approximately £9 million. In future years, these bodies will receive the equivalent of the revenue generated from the excise duty in the preceding year or the £46 million they get this year, increased by the consumer price index, whichever is the greater. We need to keep the latter as a guarantee for obvious reasons connected to potentially fast moving changes in the off-course betting market. The rate of excise duty on betting may, at any time in the future, have to be adjusted downward from the current 5% to maintain our competitiveness. The UK is putting in place substantial changes in this area and nobody can be sure yet what the full effect of mounting credit and Internet betting will be on our off-course market and how the bookmaking business here will respond.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in this legislation is putting a new operating structure into Irish racing, which will be capable of being more effective and efficient in managing what is a very big and important business for us. We want to give this sector the level and security of funding it requires to fully exploit the potential for the benefit of all concerned. It can do this only if it can plan into the future and this will be possible only if it is guaranteed the level of funding promised.</P>
    <P>The mechanism of the fund to be managed by my Department, as set out in section 12 of the Bill is, in the view of the Government, the best way to achieve this. However, I also feel that if this House agrees with this procedure, it should also be involved in reviewing it from time to time. <Col N="854" /> The total aggregate limit placed on funds to be made available to the horse and greyhound industries through this guarantee system is £200 million, which may be increased only by regulations that must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This means that the Dáil and the Seanad will have an opportunity to debate this funding again in three to four years' time. I know that Deputy Dukes is also committed to the principle that such regulations and instruments are not just deposited in the Library but that this House is given the opportunity of having a full debate on them if it so wishes.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, all of the necessary financial and audit controls required will be implemented. The Department's appropriation account will clearly show, in a special note to the account, the payments into and out of the fund. The Secretary General of my Department will be accountable to the Public Accounts Committee in the normal way. Under sections 13 and 14, the annual accounts of HRI and Bord na gCon will be required to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the chief executives of those bodies will be accountable to the Public Accounts Committee in respect of those accounts. Under section 15 those chief executives may also be required by other Oireachtas Committees to give evidence concerning the general administration of the bodies.</P>
    <P>Members will recall the last time we discussed the funding of the horse and greyhound racing industries in this House was on the passing of the Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Act in 1999. At the time, the Minister for Finance had decided, in order to ensure the off-course betting market here in Ireland maintained its competitiveness internationally, to reduce the excise duty on off-course betting from 10% to 5%. This had the knock-on effect that we had to abolish the 5% on-course betting levies which were an important source of income for the IHA and Bord na gCon. As a result and in order to replace that revenue for the bodies concerned we introduced among other things a new 0.3% betting turnover charge on on-course bookmakers as well as a flat rate charge of between £500 and £2,000 on each off-course betting shop. The revenue went straight to those bodies.</P>
    <P>It is considered that these charges are no longer required in the context of the new funding arrangements for HRI and Bord na gCon being proposed in this Bill. I therefore intend to remove these charges as soon as possible. Section 19 removes the turnover charge from 1 July next. However, I may have to look again at that date depending on progress on the enactment of this Bill and will consider introducing a Committee Stage amendment if required. Section 20 removes the flat rate charges from 31 August. As such charges for this year would not be payable under the 1999 Act until 1 September, there will therefore be no money due in respect of these charges in 2001 with the possible exception of any amounts that remained unpaid from last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Up to now the totalisator legislation &ndash; the 1929 Totalisator Act, regulations made thereunder and licences issued to the IHA and Bord na gCon &ndash; restricted these bodies to operating their tote betting services at racecourses and greyhound tracks or by credit accounts. The IHA has examined the possibility of moving onto the High Street with their tote betting and believe that there is a lot of heretofore untapped business for the tote which could be exploited by providing tote betting services through the off-course bookmakers shops. I think this would be a good development and I understand that the off-course bookmakers are also happy with the idea. Therefore I have incorporated authorisation for this move in section 17 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another extension to tote betting which both the IHA and Bord na gCon are anxious to develop is what is called &ldquo;co-mingling&rdquo; with some of their tote counterparts abroad. This would allow Irish punters, through the tote services here, to bet into some of the very large tote pools operated on the big international events abroad and punters in those jurisdictions could bet into our pools, basically making for bigger pools and more excitement and with it, it is hoped, significantly higher turnover and benefits for Irish racing. I have provided for these developments in sections 17 and 18.</P>
    <P>I have also taken the opportunity to remove a general restriction which the Betting Act, 1931, puts on punters here preventing them betting with bookies outside Ireland. In effect, this was difficult if not impossible to police or enforce. In fact, no prosecutions have ever been taken under this law. Furthermore, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and I both agree that it would not be appropriate for us to prohibit Irish people from betting abroad while taking measures here to ensure the international competitiveness of our own off-course betting operation to enable Irish bookmakers to encourage the punters outside the State to bet into our market. This business will survive or otherwise, based on the variety and quality of its products and competitive costing. Section 18(2) repeals the relevant 1931 provisions.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 16 of the Schedule to the Bill effectively amends the Schedule to the 1994 Act and defines the new rules on the composition of and appointments to the board of HRI. The board is being reduced from 15 to 12 which will make it more compact and manageable. The only member of the new board to be effectively decided by the Government will be the chairman. All the others will be nominated directly by the relevant representative industry organisations concerned. These organisations will be required to use an open and fair electoral process to democratically select their nominees. Because of the significant transfer of functions taking place from the Turf Club and National Hunt Steeplechase Committee to HRI, their representation goes up to five <Col N="856" /> members on the board. The other interests to be represented on the board will be the racecourses, owners, trainers, breeders, bookmakers, employees and the sector in Northern Ireland, each of which will get one seat on the board. We are putting in a system of board members retiring by rotation. From the outset, three members will retire each year to allow for a regular infusion of fresh blood while constantly maintaining a strong element of continuity for planning purposes.</P>
    <P>As it was not possible to accommodate all the interests in this sector on the board itself, I have decided to require the new body to set up and maintain a racegoers consultative forum. This will include representatives of racegoers, their clubs, racecourse supporters and any other interest group which makes a case for itself and is affected by the decisions of HRI or who use the facilities or services provided by HRI. The forum can be used to beneficially explore issues which are important to those interests and puts a formal mechanism in place for bringing their views and recommendations to the attention of HRI. Under section 11(5) of the Bill, HRI will be required to have regard to any opinions expressed by the forum.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the staffing of HRI and in particular the arrangements for the transfer of staff and the protection for such employees of the IHA and the Turf Club which I have built into this legislation. Section 27 of the Bill provides for the immediate transfer, upon the establishment of HRI, of all the staff of the IHA to the new body. For logistical reasons it may not be possible to transfer all the functions of the registry office and the associated staff from the Turf Club to HRI on the same day. These changes may have to be effected on a separate commencement day.</P>
    <P>However, the staff of the Turf Club who are currently engaged on work in this area will be guaranteed the right to transfer to HRI with the transfer of functions. Both categories of staff, those coming from the IHA and the Turf Club are, under the provisions of section 27, being given the same guarantee that, while in the employment of HRI, they will not be brought to less beneficial terms and conditions of employment than those to which they were entitled before the transfer. Paragraph 3 of the Schedule to this Bill affords these staff the same rights in relation to their superannuation entitlements.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Bill provide for new terms of reference for HRI's fixtures committee to seek to protect important fixtures for racecourses and to give the final decision on such fixtures to the board of HRI. HRI will be allowed to give graded grants of up to 100% for development work at racecourses relating to the implementation of important health and safety measures. There will be improved controls on on-course bookmakers while on-course betting offices will be given authority for extended opening hours to put them on a par with off-course shops.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation to the Opposition and to the spokes<Col N="857" /> man on agriculture for facilitating the Second Stage of this Bill today and for their support for this important development. All of these are progressive developments and will lead to even more exciting times ahead for Irish horse and greyhound racing and punters. We must all pull together to achieve the best results from this and I am now confident that such will be the case. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Before I say anything about the Bill I should declare an interest in order to comply with the political correctness of how we must conduct business these days. The interest I have is that together with Deputies Power and Wall I represent the constituency of Kildare South which is the southern half of County Kildare and the north-western quarter of County Kildare. It is of course the true physical and spiritual home, not only of the thoroughbred horse industry but of the horse industry in general, and is indeed one of the most important centres of the greyhound industry in the country. In both we have breeders, trainers, owners, races and punters and we take a keen interest in the matters before us here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of some satisfaction for all involved in the industry that we are now looking at a modernised structure for the horse industry in general. Times change, the world changes, customers need change and so it was incumbent on the structures in the industry to change. Customers need good facilities. The racing business generally, and this applies to both horses and greyhounds, has to compete with other leisure activities. There is an expanding range of other leisure activities and if people in the business do not keep up with them they will suffer. As the Minister knows we cannot control the weather. We must ensure that there is enough interest and excitement generated to overcome its effects. When the racing is good, people do not worry about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need good facilities. The Minister stated that in recent years there is an increase in attendance at horse and greyhound racing. At horse racing, it grew to 1.35 million and at greyhound racing to 900,000 with the expectation of more than 1 million this year. We can be happy, but it is not enough to state that. We must ensure continued growth. Good attendance at race meetings is income driven. The more disposable income <Col N="858" /> people have, the more they have to spend on racing, but more also to be attracted to other forms of entertainment. Horse and greyhound racing did well in recent years but cannot rest on their laurels. The Minister, who is more expert than me, will agree that horse racing venues need considerable attention to the quality of facilities and comfort offered to race-goers. The days when people put up with discomfort because they enjoyed racing are gone. They expect good standard of facilities and comfort at their sports. The structures being put in place, and the people involved, show an awareness of that. I am confident the necessary improvements will be high on the new horse racing body's list. I join the Minister in congratulating Irish Thoroughbred Marketing on its achievements. It is an important initiative for the business. The Minister would agree that it represents the recent importation into the business of a new, modern approach to marketing that pays dividends.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill that has secured broad agreement from the main actors. The Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance had difficulty in getting necessary agreement to put these structures in place. I congratulate the Ministers and those they dealt with in the industry's bodies on reaching a conclusion over them. It was difficult because standing positions and traditional rights had to be modified and rejigged. It took commitment from everybody and I recognise that achievement.</P>
    <P>It required much work to arrive at the Bill's proposal in section 8 on media rights. I hope it will work to the industry's general benefit. However, I suggest that the Minister, now that he is not negotiating with the horse industry, speaks to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera. Arrangements for media rights may be scuttled if she does not adapt our structures to the new digital television age. She must take more determined measures than she has done to ensure that in the expanding range provided by digital television we will not lose out. In horse and greyhound racing, we have images that are marketable at home, in the UK and elsewhere. The framework lies in Deputy de Valera's hands. The Minister should awaken that lady and get her to act appropriately for Irish interests.</P>
    <P>The punters are the most important people in this business. Section 9 provides for a consultative forum for punters' organisations. The Minister thinks he did a great job on this, but then states that, in the interests of streamlining, the main organisation's board is reduced from 15 to 12 with no punters' representative. I am not happy that he fobs off punters with this forum. He says that it is an improvement, which it is. There was a punters' representative on the old board, but, without being disobliging to that person, she did not do much for them. The Minister presents the forum as an improvement, but it is only better than no regard for the punters' interests. Other interests on the board have more influence than <Col N="859" /> the punters. Not only are they on the board, but they can make separate representations to it. Thoroughbred breeders, and other sectoral and professional interests, can raise issues before a board on which their own representatives sit. Punters from the consultative forum will make their case to a board that has none of their representatives. The Minister and his colleagues tell me not to worry about them because the 12 board members will themselves be punters. They are not there as punters but legitimately to represent other interests. Before we get to Committee Stage, the Minister should reflect on this and instead of reducing the membership to 12, for which there is no reason, provide for punters' representation on it.</P>
    <P>There is a great fashion around these days to reduce the size of committees, and it is often a good thing to do. However, a committee of 12 is not a great gain in terms of efficiency over a committee of 15. The Minister's colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach spent a fair bit of time earlier this year and last year in the run up to the Nice Treaty arguing that we did not need to reduce the size of the European Commission to 20. They did not succeed but they were right to make the argument. The Minister is one of a board of 16, the Government and the Attorney General, and I do not think he will say that is a big, unwieldy board. Although some of them are fairly unwieldy people, there is nothing wrong with the size of the institution. By the time we get to Committee Stage, I want the Minister to come back with a proposal to put punter representation on the board of this new body.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill, and properly so, for auditing and accounting in the interests of transparency. Those provisions are very good but I would like to speak about one part of it which is important. It has certainly helped to open my eyes and I hope it will open my eyes in the future without me having to go to such trouble. One of the provisions in force here is a thoroughbred foal levy. There has been a good deal of argument about this levy and whether it is fair. I have an anonymous correspondent who I am sure writes to many other Members and I get a good deal of grief about this levy. It took me a long time to try to get some figures about this levy. I could not get them from the Minister's Department or, with any dispatch, from the Irish Horseracing Authority but I found them to my satisfaction in the<i> Irish Farmers' Journal </i>of 31 March 2001. It gave a table that analysed the foal levy income for the year 2000. If one looks at the two highest rates of foal levy, the D rate and the E rate, the business there is done by 18% of the stallions. They produce 12% of the foals and 35.8% of the total revenue from the levy. In other words, those two higher rates produce three times their relative share of levy compared to their share of foals. If one looks at the bottom rate, the A rate, it accounts for just under 25% of the foals and 6% <Col N="860" /> of the levy incomes. They are producing one quarter of what would be their relative share on average.</P>
    <P>I began with the belief that the rates structure for the foal levy was a bit skewed but having looked at the figures, I think it is quite reasonable. Whoever the anonymous gentleman is who keeps sending me these things, I would ask him to please give me a telephone number or an address so that I, and maybe one or two others in the House, can discuss the issue with him so that we can dispose of this irritation about this matter once and for all. I have had further correspondence from the Irish Horseracing Authority about it but in the light of that information, there is a defensible structure for that foal levy. It is only a pity it took so long to get the information. I congratulate the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> for producing it before anybody else in the business seemed to be able to get their act together to produce the information.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to find a provision that the chief executives of the bodies and people who work for the new body will be available to come before committees of the Oireachtas to discuss their business, because that is important. They have very substantial powers. For example, there is a race fixtures committee, as there should be, in the new body. That is power in the horse racing business. The people who have a say in deciding fixtures, venues and dates, have a real and very substantial power in the business. There have been arguments about it in the past, as the Minister well knows, and a transparent procedure where everybody's interests are properly taken into account is essential.</P>
    <P>Allied to that is the power to give grants for the development of race courses. There again transparency in the way decisions are made will be very important. There have been times in the past when some race courses felt they were in a particularly disadvantaged position because they did not seem to have the right connections among the people arranging the fixtures or deciding on the grants. We need a transparent procedure so that we can see there is equity and that particular race courses or parts of the country are not left feeling that they are being unfairly discriminated against.</P>

That is important and is an essential component of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the greyhound industry, a number of changes are made here, although not anything like as far-reaching as those in relation to the horse racing industry. The Minister must be aware that there is frequently considerable friction between Bord na gCon and operators in the <Col N="861" /> greyhound racing business. There is often friction between Bord na gCon and people operating or in charge of races. As far as I know there is current friction between Bord na gCon and certain sections of the sporting press. I am not sure what the reasons for this are; it may involve personality problems. It behoves the Minister to look at the situation in Bord na gCon, to consider with the board whether there is an excessive amount of unnecessary friction and to perhaps suggest ways &ndash; he has a very emollient personality &ndash; in which this friction could be reduced to the benefit and comfort of people in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for sharing his limited time. I am glad we have the opportunity to deal with this important legislation. All of the main political parties support what is being done to enhance and improve horse racing not just as a sport, but as an industry. We will co-operate fully with the Minister in his efforts to have the legislation passed and improved, if necessary. Committee Stage will be quite interesting in that regard.</P>
      <P>I did not hear the Minister's initial comments but I am sure he gave a very good overview of the lengthy run in to this legislation. I welcome the establishment of Horse Racing Ireland and that the Irish Horseracing Authority and the former Turf Club will now form part of this new structure. We had an opportunity some months ago to debate the wider aspects of this proposals.</P>
      <P>On that occasion I reflected on the fact that while the Turf Club must take its share of the blame for delaying the creation of Horse Racing Ireland, it has a proud history of service to horse racing which should not be forgotten as we move into a new era. To the average punter, Turf Club personnel often appeared not simply distant but almost of a different era. However, they did their job effectively and we should recognise that. I am glad the new body, Horse Racing Ireland, has the capacity to ensure that the concerns of the now former Turf Club are fully catered for.</P>
      <P>I concur with my colleague, Deputy Dukes, on the need to look at marketing to ensure continuing attendance at race meetings. When we see the crowds and excitement at some of the bigger race meetings, we may be fooled into believing that all is well in racing. However, across the country at provincial tracks, the rate of increasing attendance is not as it should be. At meetings which are not seen as a festival or a fashion show, the age profile of those attending is becoming more and more elderly, suggesting that a major marketing effort is required to ensure that racing as a sport continues to attract new spectators. Racecourses could do a better job of marketing their facilities although, in some cases, the facilities are limited. A better marketing performance by individual racecourses, combined with a national effort, would increase attendance at races and, regardless of the guaranteed budget it will now have, that is essential if racing is to survive and thrive and continue to attract new spectators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> The question of facilities or lack of them was addressed by Deputy Dukes. I fully concur with his view. In that regard, I hope Horse Racing Ireland will look into the possibility of developing an all-weather race track here because there is a gap in the market in terms of horses of limited ability and, from the point of view of punters, all-weather racing under floodlights might prove attractive to people who do not currently go to race meetings. In Britain over the past month or six weeks there has been talk of developing another all-weather track. Anything which affords a further outlet to owners, trainers, breeders, punters and spectators should be encouraged. I hope we will see such a development here in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>That there will be a sound financial basis for racing with better and guaranteed prize money as a result of this legislation is welcome. However, we must ensure that the value of prize money at the lower end of the market continues to increase. The vast majority of people who are in any way involved in race horse ownership here lose money. The statistical base across Europe and worldwide shows that Ireland and Britain are the worst possible places in which to own race horses. In many other countries there can be a financial return from race horse ownership, but that does not happen here. We need to start at the lower end of the market. To that extent I welcome the increase in prize money at that end of the market in recent months. We must try to plough in extra resources to ensure that there is some prospect, however small, of people getting some sort of return on their investment. We cannot expect three or four super owners to keep the industry going.</P>

      <P>I will not comment. I have addressed the issue of incentives for breeders on a few occasions. I have no difficulty with the current incentives for people who stand stallions. However, the other side of the equation is that there are no incentives for the person who owns two or three brood mares. That should be addressed if we are to secure the foundation of Irish racing. I hope there will be some way of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recent initiative by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development putting in place a system of grant aid under the alternative farming structure which will allow grants to be paid for the construction of stables and so on. I regret, however, that the scheme is quite restrictive in terms of the income limit. Perhaps that could be looked at because of the need to improve facilities on farms right around the country. More people could become involved in breeding a couple of horses if they had the facilities. The recent grant package is a help in that regard, but more <Col N="863" /> is required and perhaps the conditions attaching to the scheme could be looked at.</P>
    <P>I concur with my colleague, Deputy Dukes, on the question of media rights. Will the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, tackle the issue of the appalling coverage of Irish racing by RTE? It is a disgrace that our national broadcasting service gives such scant coverage to Irish racing. If sports news at six o'clock on Sunday evening reluctantly carries the results of that day's racing, they have disappeared by the time the late sports news is broadcast the same night.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should be, but he is not.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister and many of my colleagues in the House, I am known to be fond of the races. Anybody who had an opportunity to read my column, &ldquo;My Favourite Share&rdquo; in last Sunday's Independent will realise that I have more faith in the nags than in shares. I hope I will have more luck anyhow.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation. It has been a long time in gestation. One could say it had an interrupted gestation. However, it is the final product that counts, and the Minister has initiated a very important legislative basis for the future of the Irish horse and greyhound racing industry. It was difficult from a number of perspectives. I recall the memorandum of understanding of 19 October 2000 which was issued by the Minister and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. One of the difficulties was that the Minister was dealing with people who for a significant period of time had been in control of various aspects of the industry and they had to be persuaded that they were moving into a new era and that it would be more positive for the industry if they were brought under the one umbrella. That would be more sensible in the long-term but there is always some resistance to change. A good job was done by all on which I compliment the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party and I broadly welcome the Bill, which obviously presages a significant restructuring of <Col N="864" /> the organisation and administration of horseracing and greyhound racing. Increased funding of both industries on a sustained, guaranteed basis, most importantly, for their ongoing development on a permanent basis is to be heartily welcomed.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes that spectator comfort and convenience are now all-important, particularly when there are alternatives. People have more disposable income and will pick pursuits that give them greater comfort and satisfaction. This means if the horseracing industry fails in this aspect, the fundamental reason behind the Bill's introduction, it will lose out to competing sporting interests and alternative leisure pursuits. That is the reason the Bill is so important and welcome.</P>
    <P>The contribution of horseracing to the State has been outlined by the Minister but it is particularly important in terms of employment. I concur with the Minister on the significant contribution of horseracing to rural development in particular. It has been a significant alternative industry and will probably assume greater significance because of the alternative enterprise scheme. As Deputy Bradford said, we hope the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will be able to help with other aspects of the industry. It is an important source of income for farms both as a principal and supporting enterprise, particularly in my area.</P>
    <P>There are 30,000 people gainfully employed, either directly or indirectly, by the industry. It is, therefore, a significant contributor to the Exchequer; the benefits permeate through the economy and help to sustain rural villages. I hope everyone gains from the Bill: those who work in the yards, the head lads, grooms and stable boys and stable girls. Sometimes they were not overpaid &ndash; let us put it that way &ndash; and though they are now looked after by the minimum wage I hope everyone now shares in the prosperity. That is very important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power would agree it was disappointing that the Punchestown race meeting was not held this year. Deputy Dukes may think I represent the constituency which includes Fairyhouse but although I would not mind if I did, it is located up the road from me. I would rather have all those festivals brought to Kilbeggan but I, too, was disappointed that there was no race meeting in Punchestown this year. It is an event of particular significance to the racing fraternity and ordinary people in the midlands. It also represented a significant economic loss, as Deputies Power and Dukes would indicate. Deputy Wall told me it was a significant loss to Naas and surrounding areas. I hope it will be back on track in the not too distant future; I am sure the Minister will be working in this regard also.</P>
    <P>The thoroughbred sector is very important. The number of thoroughbreds registered annually has increased by one quarter in the past four to five years. This represents a significant contribution to the economy in terms of exports and provides a valuable source of revenue. As the <Col N="865" /> Minister and Deputy Dukes said, there is much potential in the export sector yet to be exploited. I congratulate Irish Thoroughbred Marketing on what it has achieved to date. Last year was particularly memorable, as the Minister said, considering the number of significant successes we had in Group 1 races.</P>
    <P>While that is the deluxe end of the industry, I always cast my mind back to where things start &ndash;  point to points, where the ordinary farmer has some say, be it in Enfield, Castletowngeoghegan, Slanemore or Kilkenny West. I hope some effort will be made to help those organisations which have kept us going through very lean times. I often hear Ted Walsh talking about the importance of point to points and a jockey from my area, young Anthony Ross, is now doing well in England. He is from a renowned racing family and started off in Castletowngeoghegan at point to points. He has now risen through the ranks. That is the reason I have particular empathy with starting small and rising through the ranks. We all glory in major achievements but we should not forget where all this starts. That is very important.</P>
    <P>On a parochial level, we are lucky in County Westmeath to have two major venues for racing in Kilbeggan racecourse and Mullingar greyhound racing track. Kilbeggan has risen from small beginnings to having six important evening meetings throughout the year. The Mullingar track is an excellent facility located right in the heart of the town and has two weekly meetings. Great emphasis is placed on quality and comfort and the facilities were recently refurbished; the management and directors have every reason to be proud of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes and Deputy Yates, when Minister, were involved with the Kilbeggan track, a unique course in a natural setting. It is easy on the eye and ideal for viewing. One need only look at it to see how prudent investment has reaped tremendous dividends. It was developed at a cost of £1 million and the entire track was resurfaced and spectator areas were improved. This combines to put Kilbeggan at the top when it comes to spectator pleasure and it is a credit to the industry, to the drive and initiative of a young person involved, Paddy Dunican, and to the local community that we have one of the best racecourses in the country. This illustrates what can be done with a good source of funding and it shows the reason the development of the horseracing industry should be supported. It shows what can be done with vision, effort, innovation, enterprise and, crucially, a sustained funding base.</P>
    <P>I have few quibbles with the Bill but I concur with Deputy Dukes's comments. Paragraph 16 of the Schedule deals with the composition and appointments to the board of the HRI, while section 9 establishes the racegoers' consultation forum. That is only a sop. It is less than ideal and basically a toothless tiger. One has no influence; it is at boardroom level that one has influence. One can make all the recommendations one <Col N="866" /> wants but if nobody is listening, they are useless. In the rush to put the new structure in place, and particularly in the context of the memorandum of understanding to which I referred on 9 October, one error was made: there was a failure to provide for specific representation for punters. I was disappointed to observe this glaring deficiency in the memo of understanding which emerged from the meeting. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has been around for a long time and he knew we were going to come at him. He decided to pre-empt our criticism in section 9 by allowing for a Racegoers Consultative Forum. With respect, the forum is a sop.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes was right to say that to reduce the size of a committee from 15 members to 12 is an insignificant measure. I am sure the Association of Irish Racecourse Owners would like to have a second representative on the board of Horse Racing Ireland. The Turf Club has five representatives on the board and other bodies are also well represented, but the voice of the punter is not heard which is a glaring omission. While it is claimed that punters' views are taken on board, those who are consulted are not punters in the real sense. The opinions of ordinary people who enjoy going to the races on Friday evenings should be heard as they may have a great deal to contribute to improving matters. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will demonstrate a cognisance of our arguments on Committee Stage. The structure of the board should reflect punters, who represent an important section of the racing fraternity.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives an ideal opportunity to ensure that punters' voices are heard, something which has not happened in the past. I know the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development sought agreement with the Turf Club last October, but it was extremely foolish to agree who would constitute the board and to definitively fix limits. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development may now have difficulties in unravelling the board to allow what we seek. Those who are interested in racing tell us they would like to be part of the board of Horse Racing Ireland. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, considers my comments.</P>
    <P>A number of other aspects of this Bill have been brought to my attention. I am glad Deputy Dukes has teased out the situation regarding foal levies, as I received letters on the matter from all over the place. I could not reply to the person who wrote letters to me as I did not have his address, but Deputy Dukes has brought the debate to a rational conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association is the only organisation within the thoroughbred industry recognised by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. He is aware, however, that not all thoroughbred breeders are happy, especially within the national hunt sector. I am not sure if the ITBA represents all thoroughbred breeders or a smaller percentage. There are 160 national hunt breeders in <Col N="867" /> Westmeath, but only about 5% of them are members of the ITBA.</P>
    <P>I am not sure why I take such an interest in this, but perhaps it is as the ITBA is funded by all breeders through mandatory foal levies. Of the 19 elected members of the ITBA council, about 16 come from three counties. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, said the board of HRI would be decided by a fair electoral process to ensure it is representative. If about 80% of the ITBA council is from three counties, I think it is important that representation of the wider industry is taken into account when members of the board of HRI are selected.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the funding of Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon. These bodies will receive a sum equivalent to the revenue generated from excise duty in the preceding year, or else £46 million as indexed from the consumer price index. I am glad there is a base and that the bodies will receive whatever sum is greater. The rate of excise duty will probably vary from the current 5% rate, as bookmakers are waiting for a signal from the Minister for Finance to abolish betting tax, a signal I am sure will be sent in the budget. If Gordon Brown places a betting tax of 1% or 1.5% on profits in the British budget next October, as he has indicated, there will be pressure here to reduce or abolish betting tax.</P>
    <P>The advent of telephone and Internet betting, which I did not know much about until it was referred to by Deputy McGahon during a debate, will open a new avenue of betting for Irish punters. Such services, if based in the United Kingdom, will not impose charges on clients following the budget there in October. The charge imposed will be related to the level of what is available from betting tax there. The base of £46 million has been put in as a floor to be updated by the CPI. The British Government is changing its betting tax system to attract some of the bookmakers who have relocated to tax-free areas, and we will have to wait to see if it will be a success. What measures are being considered by the Government in relation to the current 5% betting tax?</P>
    <P>I recall points made vociferously by Deputy McGahon and me when dealing with the Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Bill, 1999. We felt the flat rate charge of between £500 and £2,000 on each off-course betting shop and a 0.3% betting levy were unfair. I welcome sections 19 and 20 which removes those charges. The Bill allows Tote Ireland to offer its products in high street betting shops and to participate and bet in overseas pools.</P>
    <P>I am always glad when legislation removes anachronisms and unenforceable laws. The Betting Act, 1931, which made it illegal for Irish residents to place bets in Britain and elsewhere, is clearly an anachronism of the highest order. It brings the law into disrepute and can be perceived as a joke as it cannot be policed. I realise the Act is 70 years old, but it is totally foolish. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural <Col N="868" /> Development admitted this morning that no prosecution has been taken under the law to which I refer, and I understand why. I am glad it has been removed as it was an anachronism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 19 years I have been a Member of this House, this is one of the few Bills on which I find consensus. It reflects the pride those of us who are interested in the horse racing industry have in Irish racing.</P>
      <P>The Minister itemised the tremendous successes by jockeys and owners during the past year. The English racing industry seems to be dominated to a large extent by Irish jockeys, not alone national hunt jockeys but flat jockeys. Every second trainer in England, apart from the Arabs, is an Irishman. We have, understandably, great pride in Irish racing as it can hold its own with racing anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a few items I wish to address. The restructuring of the racing industry makes common sense, but I too would like to pay tribute to the efforts of the Turf Club, which has been there from the very beginning &ndash; it was probably there 100 years ago &ndash; and has played a large part in the creation of the current Irish horse racing industry. There was a tendency to rubbish its efforts in recent years and the struggles the Minister and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, had to encourage this merger. We must acknowledge the contribution made by the Turf Club.</P>
      <P>One of my beefs is that the fixtures committee down through the years has shown a definite bias and nobody can deny that. There is a three tiered operation in place. The glamorous tracks like the Curragh, Leopardstown, Punchestown, Fairyhouse and, dare I mention, Clonmel seem to get the plum dates. The second tier are the southern holiday meetings. It is a case of the devil take the hindmost for the rest of the tracks, the poorly supported tracks, such as the track in my town of Dundalk, in Sligo and places like that. I acknowledge the great success of the Kilbeggan track which was threatened with closure but due to local initiative is now a resounding success. The weaker tracks need more attention and more lucrative dates. Dundalk needs a continual guarantee of racing on 12 July and other meetings, including Sunday meetings etc. if it is to continue in operation.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the impact of the foot and mouth disease on the Irish racing industry. It has definitely put a damper on revenue for this year. Many meetings were curtailed and much money, including prize money, was lost, and much additional expense was incurred by owners &ndash; hapless people. The racing industry has taken a bit of a hammering this year. Compensatory measures should be introduced for the Downpatrick and Down Royal meetings, as they have suffered more than most and meetings should be given to those two tracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about propriety in Irish racing and there is a need for surveillance. Some years <Col N="869" /> ago I suggested that a well known West End musical &ldquo;Fiddler on the Roof&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not open old sores.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a case of old sores with some of the Deputy's friends down on the Curragh but not with the ordinary punter. I suggested that perhaps &ldquo;fiddler on the hoof&rdquo; might be a more appropriate name for Irish racing. It was resented by some trainers and owners but appreciated by the ordinary Joe Soap &ndash; the man who punts &ndash; who keeps racing going. While it was maybe a little unkind, there was a degree of truth in it. That is why one will find more punters in Irish betting shops than at the average race meeting. That is because there is a suspicion that all is not always right with Irish racing. Only last night at Gowran Park a prominent jockey was fined £1,000. I am not sure what the alleged offence was &ndash; it was probably for not riding his horse out &ndash; but the explanation he gave was that he was looking after his horse's interest. That is very commendable and laudable, but if there was a problem concerning the horse's interest, he should not have been racing because he should have been racing to win. The fact that I backed a winner was incidental.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I pose is, what about the punters' interests. That is the kernel point. If racing in Ireland is really to take off, apart from the fashion shows and the visit by Joan Collins to the Derby, we must have clean racing here. That is a question that probably no one else but myself will address in this Chamber. There was a question mark over Irish racing and it remains in place. While surveillance may have been improved in recent years, that is the way it should be if punters are to continue to go in sufficient numbers to Irish racing.</P>
      <P>There was talk about media rights in the context of the Bill and the Minister, Deputy de Valera, seemed to get a bit of a hammering, which was met with a smile by the Minister, Deputy Walsh. I would like to pay tribute to Stuart Kenny of Paddy Power for his initiative in making daily television available in his betting shops for Irish racing. Until that happened betting in the average betting shop was limited.  Kenny's initiative resulted in a significant upsurge in betting turnover in every betting shop in this country. He is to be commended for that as for his initiatives in the betting industry generally.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to take on board the threat posed to one of the loveliest tracks in this country, Leopardstown, a track on a par with any track in the UK.</P>

      <P>Coming from Kildare it is only natural I would have a keen interest in the racing industry. My parents also took a fairly keen interest in it. I would have to give more credit to a parish priest who nurtured and cultivated my interest in it by bringing me to many of the race tracks throughout the country and also to greyhound tracks and the odd coursing meeting. It was a great education. He used to go to Cheltenham each year and one of the highlights I had as an altar boy was when I gave him £20 to back Comedy of Errors in the Champion Hurdle &ndash; the only reason I tell Members that is that the horse won.</P>
      <P>In Kildare, we appreciate the importance of the horseracing industry and the Minister outlined some of our wonderful successes, particularly last year. That success continued last weekend when an Aidan O'Brien trained filly won the French 1,000 Guineas and an Irish jockey, Jamie Spencer, landed the biggest prize of his career. These are triumphs we take for granted. We are as good, if not better, than the rest of the world when it comes to breeding, training or riding race horses, and it is important that we give the industry every facility and opportunity to develop and to continue that wonderful success.</P>
      <P>The Bill attempts to restructure the organisation and administration of horse racing and, more importantly, guarantees future funding for both the horse and greyhound racing industries. It will establish Horse Racing Ireland to replace the Irish Horseracing Authority and take over some of the functions of the Turf Club.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the role of the Turf Club. It carried out its duties with an efficiency and honesty that is not matched in any other industry. We salute its members for all they have done and wish them well in their future roles.</P>
      <P>For a long number of years the greyhound industry seemed to be dying on its feet. I acknowledge the tremendous effort made by Bord na gCon, under Mr. Paschal Taggart. The Minister outlined the wonderful success and transformation of that industry. In a short time, prize money and attendance at race meetings has almost doubled. It has become fashionable to attend greyhound race meetings, but it is important that the investment which has taken place at the Dublin tracks is mirrored in tracks around the country.</P>

      <P>The work which was promised some time ago at Newbridge, the track nearest my home, has finally started. We can no longer expect people to turn up out of loyalty at race tracks, either for horses or dogs, unless there are proper facilities.</P>
      <P>In the horse racing industry, there has been significant expenditure on improving facilities and providing new facilities at many of our tracks. While this is welcome, we have neglected facilities for the stable staff and that must be dealt with immediately. The racing industry has enjoyed tremendous success over the years, even from the point of view of horses in training, runners, races and prize money. The number of horses in the industry increased from 4,666 last year to 4,776 this year. Last year there were more than 25,500 runners, while the figure for the previous year was just over 24,000. There were 1,119 races last year, compared to 1,866 the previous year. Prize money increased from £20.4 million in 1999 to £24.2 million last year. There has been a 74% increase in prize money since 1996, a gigantic increase in anyone's terms.</P>
      <P>While it is important that there is group 1 races and that the status of Irish racing is protected, it is also vital that we look after the people in the industry who are competing for the smaller prizes. Last year, 22.5% of all races were worth in excess of £10,000. That is a huge advance which has taken place over the past number of years and that is the sort of improvement and progress we must encourage.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to owners' cost. When one considers that there were fewer than 5,000 horses in training last year and the prize money was just over £24 million, it is obvious that most people will not make money and that the investment is more about entertainment. We have seen this here in the House where a number of Members have formed a syndicate which has enjoyed a good few wins. The horse has more than paid for itself, but it is a good example to others of what can be achieved. For a small investment, people can get a great pay-back. There is a wonderful social side to racing and this is what we must encourage. It was once said in relation to horse racing that if one wants to make a small fortune, one must invest in a large fortune. Perhaps that is truer today than ever, but people are still prepared to support the industry and many are making a living from it. There is room for large and small investors and we must treat them all in a similar fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to return to the stable staff and the way they are being treated. There are 26 race courses in Ireland and the facilities at some of them are nothing short of a disgrace. What stable staff seek are normal facilities which would be available to any other industry. In many cases, such as in the case of the Killarney race meeting last weekend, a number of horseboxes leave the Curragh and <Col N="872" /> travel for perhaps for four hours to the track. There are no proper washing facilities at many of the courses and stable staff are unable to get a hot meal and are forced to eat in cold, unhygienic buildings. This would not be tolerated in any other industry. We have provided many new facilities for the race-goers and improved prize money for the owners, the trainers and the jockeys, but the stable staff are the forgotten people in all this and this must be addressed. Stable staff, in general, earn meagre wages, there is scant recognition or reward for their effort, and in many cases they are in poor accommodation, work long hours and have very little time off. There are inconsistent levels of training for young people starting out and no obvious career development structure.</P>
    <P>The economy has improved greatly and today most industries are crying out for staff. Unless the racing industry treats the stable staff in an acceptable manner they will seek work elsewhere. Just as we all cannot be Ministers, stable staff cannot all be top jockeys or owners of prize winning horses, but we need owners, trainers, jockeys and stable staff. They are all important ingredients in the success and continuation of the racing industry. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the position of stable staff improves. In that context, Part II of the Bill states that Horse Racing Ireland can assist educational and other institutions and organisations in providing improved training and education facilities and courses for the thoroughbred horse industry to satisfy the training and educational needs of that industry at all levels.</P>
    <P>The Race Centre on the edge of the Curragh, which has been in operation for approximately 20 years, provides courses for a small number of such people and it has been very successful. It gives them a good grounding in education, not only in riding horses but in the entire horse industry. The rate of success achieved by the people at the Race Centre in finding employment for people who completed its course has not been achieved by any other industry, even when it was difficult to find employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have the nuts and bolts of what is required and we should expand on that type of model. By its very nature, people going into the racing industry, particularly the stable staff, start their working lives at a very early age and can therefore be quite vulnerable. They need all the assistance that is available. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that they get that assistance.</P>
    <P>There were 2,816 stable staff working last year, with 50% of that number in full-time employment. That is a huge increase on the previous year when there were fewer than 2,000 stable staff in employment. It is obvious that major changes are taking place in the industry and it is important that such progress be monitored.</P>
    <P>The stable staff bonus scheme was introduced last year. This was an excellent development. It gave recognition to the contribution of the stable staff. There were problems with the scheme and <Col N="873" /> I raised the matter with the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance. The financial controller of the Turf Club has informed me that the Revenue Commissioners have approved of the scheme. We must reward stable staff and ensure that there are sufficient numbers to meet the requirements of the racing industry. Schemes such as this and other attractions must encourage workers to stay in the industry and make the industry attractive to new recruits.</P>
    <P>Persons employed directly in the horse racing industry will be nominated to the new body. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that a representative of the stable staff is nominated to the new body. It is important that the stable staff, comprising nearly 3,000 in the industry, represent a significant number of the total employed in the racing industry. They should be given a voice on the new body. The body will be given a large amount of funding and it will secure the future of the racing industry. It is important that this money should be spread evenly among all sections of the racing industry. We must ensure that the wrongs of the past are redressed and the stable staff have a voice.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the interest shown by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh.</P>

      <P>I wish to declare my keen interest not only in horse and greyhound racing, but also in coursing. I commend the Minister and his officials for bringing this Bill before the House. On a parochial level, I thank the Minister for providing funds for the new racecourse in Patrickswell, my own townland. It is a magnificent facility and it only remains for a few problems to be sorted out. There is a proposal for a new greyhound track in Limerick. I read in the local newspapers that Bord na gCon is having a problem disposing of the existing tracks. Perhaps the Minister could be of assistance to them. The land is available now and it would be a pity to lose the opportunity of acquiring it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill, 2001, will serve a positive purpose in terms of developing these two industries in the future. Horse racing, greyhound racing and coursing are all part of our culture and our heritage. They also serve a very strong economic purpose. It is vitally important that the Government is open to suggestion as to how best improve the competitive position of these industries. The Government must also be open to suggestion how best to improve the image of these industries to maintain their very high worldwide reputation. This House is aware of the importance of the horse and greyhound racing industries. While both horse and greyhound racing attract a large following from sporting interests alone, they are both more important than that. The horse and greyhound industries do much to promote tourism. They provide a high level of employment. They serve <Col N="874" /> as a positive image abroad of what is best in Ireland. International observers and investors know that the Irish horse and greyhound industries have high standards.</P>
    <P>I wish to talk about the greyhound industry. I compliment the Minister on his foresight in providing statutory base funding on an ongoing basis. This is a dream come true for the Irish greyhound board, a realisation of the hopes and aspirations of successive Bord na gCon administrations, from the days of the chairmanship of the late Dr. Paddy Maguire, and those who followed him. The annual subvention now assured to Bord na gCon is indeed a far cry from the initial once-off sum of £50,000, provided in the late 1980s, and the £250,000 allocated by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in 1991. I compliment the chairman and members of Bord na gCon for their success in the management of the industry.</P>
    <P>Now that the Irish greyhound industry has been assured funding, I ask the Minister to ensure that an equitable amount of this annual subvention be directed towards the arm of the industry which, since the start of the last century, has regulated all aspects of greyhound sports, racing and coursing, until the advent of Bord na gCon in 1958. The services provided by the Irish Coursing Club, based in Clonmel, are vital to the ongoing success of the Irish greyhound industry. It provides a role and function in compiling the stud book for the entire island of Ireland. It ensures, with unequalled professionalism, the integrity of the Irish breed, and for this it is acknowledged worldwide. It controls and registers the country's stud dogs and has wide ranging programmes in vital areas such as DNA, artificial insemination and the development of a major international market in the future export of frozen canine semen.</P>
    <P>The Irish Coursing Club has 10,000 affiliated members on both sides of the Border. For reasons which I have difficulty comprehending, it receives no subsidy or benefit from moneys collected from betting revenues within the industry nor from annual Government subventions to the industry. The legislation governing the Irish greyhound industry clearly defines the role, functions and responsibilities of the Irish Coursing Club in the development of the greyhound industry. It is now time that some meaningful funding be set aside to enable this voluntary organisation to go about its business. </P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It is obvious from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill, 2001, that greyhound racing, as Deputy Collins said, is the poor relation. In Part 3 the ratio of 4:1 in the allocation of funding is an indication that it is the poor relation. That is clear from most of the contributions on horse racing, the horse racing industry and its location and development.</P>
      <P>In his contribution the Minister said Bord na gCon has a vision for the globalisation of greyhound racing and associated betting with Ireland leading the process. I respectfully suggest that rather than going global we should go national and regional. I endeavoured to table a question to the Minister on the issue of funding for Galway race track but it was disallowed because the Minister has no responsibility in that area. I attempted to raise it on the Adjournment on Tuesday night but it was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to outline what I consider is a shame in regard to what has happened between Bord na gCon and the Galway greyhound track. I have the utmost respect for the efforts and endeavours of Paschal Taggart, chairman of Bord na gCon, and the work he has done to revolutionise the whole greyhound industry in Ireland. Having said that, once more the west is neglected. Worse than that, Bord na gCon has reneged on a commitment which I witnessed on 28 June 2000. Mr. Taggart, at the Connacht Derby, the greyhound track in Galway, announced that approximately £6 million would be provided for the upgrading of the facilities at Galway greyhound racing track sports ground, facilities shared by the Galway Show Society in co-operation with the IRFU. I have no doubt about the amount mentioned on that night. It was witnessed by some of the Minister's colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Molloy, and Deputy Fahey, now Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, who were present. Everybody welcomed it as an initiative by Bord na gCon through the Department to recognise that Galway, as the fastest growing city not only in <Col N="876" /> Ireland but in Europe, was entitled to proper facilities for greyhound racing.</P>
    <P>That commitment was well received by dog owners, the managers of the track and especially the punters. Alas, for some reason, because Lifford track has been bought by a Derry consortium and presumably because of the connections with members of Bord na gCon, somebody has torpedoed Galway's entitlement to £6 million for upgrading purposes. There was also the statement by one member of the board that foot and mouth disease was partly to blame for the reduction in the funding available to Galway, but I take it with a pinch of salt as being totally untrue. The Minister's county has benefited to the tune of £10 million from Bord na gCon. That is welcome. Anybody who has been to Cork greyhound track since its upgrading would welcome that funding. Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross and Enniscorthy are in the pot for development.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ask Bord na gCon to honour its commitment by providing the funding to which Galway is entitled. How can anybody in the west who has been involved in the industry for so long accept it as other than &ldquo;to hell or to Connacht&rdquo; even for the dogs, if the money is siphoned away to every other area? Not one track in Galway or Clare, which supports Galway, has received substantial funding since 1987 when we received a small contribution towards the upgrading of facilities in Galway. If that is fair and if that is equity within Bord na gCon's distribution of funding, it is time the Minister intervened and honoured the commitment given on 28 June 2000.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it has to be the west and Connacht that is affected at the expense of Donegal. We know that is politics. Not one member of the board is from Connacht, hence the west is losing out. I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to redress that issue in the near future. I would not have confidence in a board that can blatantly commit funding on the one hand and on the other withdraw it. I have no confidence in it and I hope the Minister will intercede in the strongest possible terms with the chairman who has to do so much for dog racing to redress that serious grievance. Those involved in the industry in Galway are crying to high Heaven to know why it has been done again to us. Why is it us always in the west? We have the facilities. There is no location in Ireland where potential facilities are available and suitable for development other than in Galway.</P>
    <P>The plans presented for the use of that £6 million were fantastic. One of the duties of Bord na gCon is to develop the greyhound industry. Globalisation of the greyhound industry rings hollow on the people who are striving against the odds to promote and continue the tradition of greyhound racing in Galway. I appeal to the Minister to intervene in the strongest possible manner to reverse that decision. The proposed alternative and the excuses used by members of Bord na gCon are not acceptable. We are now offered a <Col N="877" /> two-tier stand with reduced facilities whereas in the past, as is common in all other greyhound tracks, we would have the inclusion of corporate boxes, which would bring people, and support from industry and from many other areas into the development of greyhound racing. That has been stifled to meet the demands of internal politics in Bord na gCon to allow places like Lifford to continue. The sale of the Lifford track to a family in Derry only took place in February and the withdrawal of the Galway track happened just after that in March. If the Minister looks in detail at the politics behind this decision, he will see that all is not well within Bord na gCon. I say that in the context of acknowledging the work that Pascal Taggart has done in his efforts to make changes there. I want the Minister to find out how he was made the fall guy for what happened in Galway and to inform me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I congratulate the Minister and the Minister for State on the efforts they have made on this. This Bill addresses some of the problems in the industry.</P>
      <P>In recent months the horse racing industry has been hit by the foot and mouth disease crisis. It is now &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; again. The numbers attending race meetings are not as high as normal but that is due to continuing restrictions in agriculture and people are somewhat short of cash. When all restrictions are removed the numbers will rise.</P>
      <P>The horse racing and greyhound racing industries give huge employment in breeding, training and at the various tracks throughout the country. I thank the Minister and Bord na gCon for their interest in Longford greyhound track. A new all-weather sand track will be installed there and this is welcomed. My colleague, Deputy Ulick Burke, expressed concern about Galway. Longford track is the only one in that area of the north-west and it is vital that it continues. John Dooris, now in his 100th year, was responsible for bringing greyhound racing to Longford and I am glad to say that he is still to the good. His niece and all concerned have now worked out a deal with the local committee and Bord na gCon. Longford has always been a great area for greyhounds with people coming from Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Donegal and East Galway. There was many a <i>coup</i> pulled off on a Friday night, but they would not let on until it was over. Will the Minister convey my gratitude to Bord na gCon and I ask for continued support for Longford dog track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, last year was an exceptional year for national hunt racing. It was good to see the Irish back at Aintree and winning there. We had excellent results on the flat also. This proves how important the industry is and it is appropriate that the Government gives its wholehearted support to it. Ireland is recognised throughout the world for horse breeding and racing and resources need to be put in to maintain <Col N="878" /> standards. There is significant competition internationally and we must not lag behind. This Bill will provide the funding in a planned manner into the future for the upkeep, running and organisation of the racing industry.</P>
    <P>In the Midlands we have horse racing tracks at Roscommon, Kilbeggan and Sligo. I am a member of the supporters of Sligo track. It deserves support and I would like to see racing continue there. We also have a direct connection through Autotote in Ballymahon, which provides the tote services nationally. It has achieved high standards and has given important employment to the area.</P>
    <P>There is nothing as entertaining as racing especially during the summer when we have our evening meetings. The greyhound tracks in Shelbourne Park, Harolds Cross and Cork are great facilities and are used for other functions as well. We need to continue to improve the facilities we have and the industry deserves this. There are 30,000 people employed right across the board. I look forward to the continuance of the support, interest and financial backing for the whole industry.</P>
    <P>We can look to the future with optimism. I congratulate all the people involved over the years including some successful punters. I know the Minister has not been unlucky in the past and I wish him well in continuing to back the odd winner.</P>

      <P>Going to the races and going to a night at the dogs are two great national pastimes. There was a time when going to the track meant just that. Horses or dog tracks had very limited facilities and were somewhat primitive. In recent years greyhound racing stadia with state-of-the-art facilities have been developed while racecourses have equally developed magnificent facilities. Both sports have seen huge increases in attendances. The Bill will allow the further development of the two industries and help simplify the funding, management and development of all aspects of the sports. It is long overdue and will receive a near unanimous welcome from all those interested in the racing of dogs and horses. I am sure the Minister will not take offence if I say the Bill will enable the country to go to the dogs, dogs and horses to race in style and thousands of punters to enjoy racing in comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many important provisions in the Bill relating to both the greyhound and horseracing industries, among which is the establishment of a new State body called Horse Racing Ireland and the establishment by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of a fund to provide annual support for the horseracing and greyhound racing industries. This will be linked to the revenue generated from excise duty on off-course betting. It also provides for the lib<Col N="879" /> eralising of legislation governing the tote, which will allow foreign operators to become involved in the Irish tote. The Bill will cost money but I contend it will be money very well spent. The governing and management of the horseracing industry will be simplified, which, in turn, will make it a leaner and fitter body ensuring dynamic management and development.</P>
    <P>Horse Racing Ireland will have a partnership approach and be representative of all aspects of the industry. Although ordinary racegoers will not have direct representation, there will be a mechanism for them to present their views and proposals for consideration through the consultative forum. This is an example of how the Government views the partnership process and its importance to all aspects of Irish life.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill I wish to address is the media rights committee. Horse Racing Ireland will be given significant powers and responsibilities. It will be answerable to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. In recent times too many individuals and groups have endeavoured to ensure they do not account for themselves to Dáil committees. The Bill ensures Horse Racing Ireland will not be able to shirk its responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some would say there is little about greyhound racing in the Bill. This is because the industry has been regulated and managed effectively for many years by Bord na gCon. In fact, Bord na gCon will provide a model of good practice for Horse Racing Ireland in this respect.</P>
    <P>This is progressive legislation for two important and vital industries. The Bill cannot be enacted soon enough to allow the industries grow, prosper and develop.</P>
    <P>There are a number of bodies and organisations involved in regulating and managing horseracing. Some of them, such as the Turf Club, go back a very long way. Some are older than the State and have very long traditions and procedures. Horseracing is sometimes known as the sport of kings. Fortunately in Ireland we are low on royalty but have thousands who enjoy a day at the races. For some Members a day can stretch to a week in places such as Galway or Listowel. There has been a resurgence of interest in horseracing in recent years and huge sums have been invested in improving facilities at tracks throughout the country. In my constituency Fairyhouse and Navan racecourses are prime examples of the improvements made. As I said, going to the races in years gone by was a fairly primitive affair &ndash; a stand was a shed, catering was a chip van, the ring was secured by a rope and car parking often required the services of a tractor to ensure one got out and home. That image and the reality have changed in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is all too easy to establish a body such as Horse Racing Ireland. Formulating strategies and plans is also a relatively simple task for an industry that is confident and knows where it is going. <Col N="880" /> Providing funding to ensure plans are realised is often not so easy. The Minister is ensuring Horse Racing Ireland can function effectively by ensuring a funding mechanism is provided for in the Bill. Apart from modest capital funding, the industry will have a self-funding mechanism. Funding will be provided for by excise duty paid on off-course betting, a simple and effective mechanism to ensure the survival of the live event. In this age of technology and interactive events it is wise to ensure armchair and high street punters contribute to the live racing industry through excise duty. At times it appears that technology freaks would be happy if horseracing and greyhound racing were all virtual or the equivalent of fundraising race nights where punting takes place on old races from far away. Nothing can replace the live event and it is very welcome that support is available for live sporting events which ultimately do not cost the Exchequer money.</P>
    <P>For those not closely involved with the industry it appears that funding horseracing is unnecessary as it generates huge income. They see that horses are sold for millions of pounds, racecourses are full of helicopters and large cars and champagne flows freely. However, this picture is only one part of the spectacle and not reflective of the industry as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just when the Minister is there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Development finance is vital for any business, in particular horseracing. Providing top class facilities which will, in turn, attract adequate numbers of punters is vital. Media reports concentrate on the high rollers, the helicopters and the champagne. It is, however, a tough hard industry with early mornings, late nights and hard toil. Many trainers struggle to make ends meet. They survive on winnings and training fees. Prize money is the lifeblood of the industry and linked to punting and punters turning up at race facilities as opposed to the racetracks I described from many years back. If the industry does not receive a share of the income it generates, it will not be able to survive. The State's coffers cannot lose with a successful industry. More punters attending race meetings means more betting taxes and spending on food and drinks. Both industries are significant direct and indirect employers. Increasing funding in the industry will be the responsibility of Horse Racing Ireland. By running successful well attended meetings and having exciting racing which will attract off-course betting they will ensure a revenue stream. Unlike betting on horses, it is a win win situation. Modest investment will ensure rich rewards for the industry, the country and the State's coffers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horseracing is a tough hard industry in which to work. It must constantly strive to recruit a workforce. Stables and trainers are finding it increasingly difficult to find workers willing to <Col N="881" /> join the industry. As is the case with most industries, vacancies are increasingly being filled from overseas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, has for a long time championed the cause of the urban cowboys, the young men and women from, by and large, west Dublin who have an unbelievable passion for horses and horsemanship. Their skill on bareback ponies and horses is rivalled only by Hollywood stuntmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill, 2001, which will provide for the significant restructuring of the organisation. It will guarantee increased funding on a permanent basis for the administration of both horseracing and greyhound racing. In that respect, it is long overdue and very welcome. I had to smile when the Minister referred to this as being a subject very close to his heart. That is probably an understatement. I would debate the fact that it might not be so good for his health. Being out in the open air, whether in rain, hail or sunshine, enjoying the best animals in the world participate in races in this country must lift the heart, even when matters are not going so well on the betting front. I do not think that everyone who travels to race meetings must necessarily bet to enjoy themselves. That is one of the main advantages of the industry. Some go to the Galway races and never see a horse. The whole social fabric and excitement of being among the crowd indicates the extent to which the Irish racing industry has developed. One is almost not socially acceptable nowadays unless one attends the big race meetings regardless of whether one is interested in horses.</P>
      <P>The existence of the fund is very important and it is essential that it is ringfenced. The funding will be linked to the revenue generated from excise duty on off-course betting. I assume if more bets are placed, more money will be received. Will the removal of the general prohibition in the Betting Act, 1931, on people in Ireland placing bets abroad take revenue away from Irish bookies? I assume, given the competition Acts, Internet betting and the increasing popularity of a day at the races, that this aspect cannot be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available to me I would like to concentrate on an important issue and one of the first statements the Minister made. He said that the Government considers racing to be strategically important because of the employment it creates and sustains at all levels and the significant contribution it makes to rural development, farm and other incomes, the business and services sectors, tourism, the economy as a whole and the international reputation of the State. While we have a very good and well supported track for the dogs in Lifford, I would like it to be developed. As Deputy Brady said, it is no harm to go to the dogs the odd time and I am sure the people of County Donegal would like me to go to the dogs more often. It is important not to place an upper <Col N="882" /> limit on the grant aid available for small tracks. Up to now many tracks have survived on a shoestring and deserve to have their standards improved to the same degree as other tracks.</P>
    <P>I am often criticised for being parochial. However, I do not mind this because my constituents like me to be parochial. In regard to horseracing, there are some facilities north of the Galway to Dublin line, including Sligo, Roscommon, Downpatrick, Down Royal and Dundalk but there is nothing in the north west. Perhaps grants could be extended to assist small establishments and provide new establishments, which would encourage people to get involved in the activity. As the Minister will be aware, the employment statistics are such in County Donegal that we would like to have our own racing track, which would be very well supported. The high standard of horses is not limited exclusively to the south of the country. There is serious money involved in the industry. I have done my bit to support the racing industry by travelling to courses as far away as Mallow, Listowel, the Curragh and so on. I would like the horses, jockeys, bookies, trainers, stable personnel, course clerks and breeders whom I follow to have facilities in my constituency. I trust this will happen at some stage.</P>
    <P>Some may say that those who are addicted to gambling lose a lot of money. However, the vast majority who attend race meetings enjoy themselves without venturing too far astray. Many enjoy race meetings without even betting. I would like to see our racing establishments go from strength to strength, as would the Minister, and I commend him on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for agreeing to share his time and giving me an opportunity to speak on the Bill and the industry in general.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill with which I have no major difficulty. I visited the track in Cork which, as the Minister will be aware, is a fantastic facility. Everyone involved in the track must be commended for the work and investment put into it. It recently took a knock as a result of the foot and mouth scare, which is regrettable. However, they are working to get over this difficulty and move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another track in Youghal at the other end of the constituency. Will the Minister indicate the developments planned for this track? If he cannot advise me on the matter now, he might organise to send me a note at some stage on its future. As he will be aware, Youghal is very important from a tourism point of view and much development has recently taken place in the town. Much building has been taking place and many visit the area for the summer. Unfortunately, the area does not have many activities <Col N="883" /> apart from the beach and the greyhound track. I would like to see the track expanded and developed and I am sure the people of Youghal would welcome any help from the Minister in this regard. I would be interested to hear if the Minister has plans for the track and whether the passing of the Bill will help the people in the area, many of whom are very interested in greyhounds. The sport of greyhound racing is great fun but, as the Minister said, there is also a downside to this activity when people lose money.</P>
    <P>Youghal is a thriving town and a bypass is being built which will develop it further. I would be very disappointed to see the track closed and not developed. The funding which is available will create an opportunity to enhance the facility. I will be interested in what the Minister has to say on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the Bill, which I welcome. It is not before time that both horseracing and greyhound racing was properly funded on a permanent statutory basis. As the Minister will be aware, during the term of the last Government I had responsibility for greyhound racing. Some of the officials involved during that period are present. I am pleased that such great strides are being taken in regard to this activity. The sport needs extra prize money and breeders on the ground need more support for breeding schemes, kennelling, runs and so on. Unless breeders, owners and trainers are supported, the facilities provided in the past five to six years will be of no benefit. The man to look after is the man on the ground who is providing the &ldquo;athletes&rdquo; for those who support greyhound racing. I understand that this will be funded by moneys provided from excise duties and off-course betting.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that betting tax was abolished this year in England. A newspaper report which came to my attention in recent days has the headline &ldquo;Bookies seek new deal on betting tax.&rdquo; It goes on to say: &ldquo;Irish bookmakers are waiting on a signal from Finance Minister, Deputy McCreevy, that betting tax will be abolished here in the next budget. Unless this is forthcoming, they will move telephone and Internet betting sites to the UK. The threat was confirmed by a leading Irish bookmaker yesterday. He said that unless the Irish industry was put on an equal footing with its UK counterpart, where betting tax will be replaced by profits-based tax from October, there will be a mass exodus of bookies from the country. If betting tax is abolished in Ireland, will there be a decrease in the fund available for the purposes of this Bill? If so, how does the Minister propose to make up for any such reduction? That is an important matter which needs to be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, I welcome this very positive Bill. The racing fraternity, in both the horse and greyhound sector, deserves this kind of support. There is a net return from both of these industries <Col N="884" /> to the taxpayer, as well as the economic and recreational benefits. Accordingly, the Bill has merited strong support on all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank each of the Deputies who spoke in this debate for their well-informed contributions, their empathy with the industry and their constructive attitude towards it. Deputy Dukes referred to the fact that attendances are increasing at both horse racing and greyhound racing events. As he said, that trend is income-driven and is influenced by the extra leisure time which people now have. I totally accept that better facilities are needed. People expect standards comparable with other entertainment industries. I recommend to the IHA and Bord na gCon that whatever development they are undertaking should be up to the highest international standards, both in relation to tracks and facilities.</P>
      <P>I particularly emphasise the importance of good quality tracks, including consideration of the animal welfare aspect of the horses and greyhounds, as well as the comfort of the racing fraternity and the safety of jockeys. One contribution to horse racing which I particularly admire is that of the jockeys, especially national hunt jockeys, who often literally take their lives in their hands when they go around a steeplechase or a hurdle course. As we know from the experience of people such as Shane Broderick, serious injury and possible permanent disablement is a real risk. I am not sure that this aspect is always appreciated by those of us who sit comfortably in our boxes or stand seats and are entertained. I hope all track operators will take account of the need to have tracks up to a very high standard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes referred to section 8 of the Bill and, as he requested, I will certainly consult with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera. Digitalisation is the new form of communication. It is a huge advance on analogue TV and facilitates international communication. The sooner it is widely extended here in Ireland, the better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes criticised the absence of an opportunity for representation of punters on the main board. As I said in my introductory speech, I am appointing a consultative forum which will give an opportunity to punters and racing clubs to air their views. That forum will have to be serviced and the new horse racing authority will be obliged to do that and to take the opinions of the forum into account.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Dukes said about the <i>Irish Farmers Journal </i>horse section, which is an excellent publication and provides valuable information. In particular, it highlighted the issue of the foal levy and indeed it is time that matter was tidied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to accountability and transparency, which Deputy Dukes addressed at some length, I have tried in every possible way to ensure that requirement is fulfilled. The funding involved is very substantial and taxpayers are entitled to <Col N="885" /> expect transparency and accountability. The chief executives must also give an account of their stewardship and bring forward medium and long-term plans, in keeping with the permanent and long-term funding which we are placing at the disposal of the industry. This House and its appropriate committees are entitled to debate those matters.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to friction between Bord na gCon and the sporting press. I understand that there was a problem in that regard up to the end of last year but it appears from meetings which have taken place that it has subsided. I hope it is now out of the way because there is no room for it in the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford asked that consideration be given to an all-weather race track, complete with floodlights. That should, of course, be considered, with the possibilities now being provided for medium and long-term planning. I will bring it to the attention of the authorities concerned. I also share the Deputy's views on the importance of the prize money available at the lower end of the market. The bulk of the attendance at race meetings is made up of national hunt supporters, who certainly deserve their fair share of the prize money. Deputy Bradford also suggested that grants for alternative farming should be improved and made more available. With regard to Deputy Penrose's comments about punters, I refer him to the section of my speech dealing with the consultative forum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power made a very strong case for stable staff. Undoubtedly, they have been very shabbily treated. They have been poorly paid, left to operate in appalling conditions, having to change in horse-boxes and, in many cases, not provided with hot food facilities. That is just not good enough and I take on board the Deputy's comments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said that coursing should get greater consideration in the context of the overall greyhound industry. He also made a case for Limerick greyhound track. Deputy Ulick Burke made a case for Galway race track. While I obviously was not present at the meeting to which he referred, I understand Bord na gCon met with the Galway action group on 10 May to explain the situation and to assure it that there would be no compromise in relation to the Galway project. The action group representatives took the plans away to consider them and a further meeting is to take place. As I have said, my position on all of those developments is that they are up to the very highest standards, without penny-pinching.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon referred to Leopardstown racecourse and the implications of the road development plans in that area. There have been meetings involving the secretaries general of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and representatives of the National Roads Authority. I hope an amicable solution will emerge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Deputy Stanton inquired about Youghal greyhound track. There was a problem about the lease, which may have been cleared up by now, and there will be plans for development there once the lease is in order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan spoke of the importance of increasing prize-money, especially for small breeders. He alluded to a threat by some bookies or their representatives. I do not take kindly to threats from anybody. We are in the process of building an internationally competitive racing and betting industry and we will ensure that is what happens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton spoke of a need for further support for Longford track. I will ask the authorities concerned to consider that. Deputy Brady and Deputy Keaveney also made cases for their localities.</P>
    <P>I again thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate. I listened carefully to all of them and will consider the various issues raised. I understand that we will be able to begin Committee Stage of the Bill next Wednesday afternoon and I look forward to discussing the details then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to return to this Adventure Activities Standards Authority Bill. I had just referred to the issue of the membership of the authority and I will continue to discuss the function of the activities standards authority. The authority will cross quite a number of divides with the promotion, encouragement, fostering, facilitation and the regulation of safe operation of adventure activities. As the Minister outlined it will be empowered to administer schemes and grants to procure and provide educational training or advisory services and to carry out research. That broad scope is extremely important. It will advise the Minister on other matters relating to adventure activities and he will be able to confer additional functions on the authority by way of <Col N="887" /> order, after consultation with the authority. That flexibility is very important.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Dukes when he says the authority has too many roles. I come across groups all supposedly looking after a similar issue but they often fall between stools when looking for support. A group might look for funding from one agency which will say it gives advice but not funding and another which will say it gives training but not advice. That is how it happens and groups may have to go from agency to agency seeking support. That this authority will have so many roles looking after many aspects of the one issue will overcome some of the problems we have had in other agencies to date. To have one agency for all aspects is good, in terms of co-ordination, for the true development of activity centres. If it was not to be so broad, then surely it would have come under the Health and Safety Authority and we would not need a new organisation at all. Perhaps the Minister will have a view on that when he replies at the conclusion of Second Stage. If, as Deputy Dukes seemed to say last night, we only want an authority to deal specifically with the safety aspect then surely we do not need this authority as we already have the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>This authority will oversee adventure activities in 13 activities. I see that the definition includes hill-walking in areas higher than 300 metres, orienteering in areas more than 300 metres above sea level, caving, dinghy sailing, kayaking, canoeing, surfing with a surfboard, wind-surfing, scuba diving, snorkelling, abseiling, archery and rock climbing. Is that all embracing in terms of the activities that could be included? Things like jet-skiing, water-skiing and raft racing are much more related to the things that are there than what we mentioned last night. Bungee jumping was mentioned then and I was indirectly asked whether I had participated in it. There are other marine activities that would be related to the activities there but they will be excluded under this. Are they already included under some existing authority? If not, why are they not included? Will the Minister look at this in relation to what he said concerning the facility to expand the scope of the authority by adding or deleting items from the list? He should perhaps look at all water based activities as one thing. That brings us to my original point that if we are to have one group looking after all aspects of these 13 activities then associated activities not coming under the remit of the authority will defeat the whole purpose of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that under the role of the authority it will be mandatory for all adventure activity operators within these specified adventure activities to register with the authority and the authority will develop codes of practice for the specified activities. It will be mandatory for the operators to abide by the codes that will be introduced. It is very important that the operators are inspected by the authority and that there is scope, <Col N="888" /> in cases of non-compliance with the code, for the authority to direct an operator to suspend or cease the provision of the activity or to remove the operator from the list. The mandatory aspects of registration and the code of practice and inspections are essential. Last year I pressed for the mandatory training for fishermen, because I believe it is not right to have only a voluntary code in an area with the potential for loss of life. Voluntary codes will not always be followed. People can lose lives unnecessarily and just as in leisure activities, it is important to have mandatory codes in commercial fishing. I welcome the introduction of codes of practice as they improve standards and standardisation.</P>
    <P>I spoke on the Agriculture Appeals Bill on Tuesday. This was a long awaited opportunity for farmers to put their cases on many schemes beyond the two schemes being discussed under the Bill. Only now are we bringing in a facility for appeals on a wide range of agriculture schemes. It is already in operation for social welfare. It is just a matter of time before people will ask for an appeals system in relation to this Bill. Can there be an appeals system for genuine cases where people are closed down? Just as in agriculture cases, there will always be a genuine case.</P>
    <P>Who will inspect the inspectors and what qualifications will inspectors have? On the issue of charging for inspections, if the Health and Safety Authority does not charge for its inspections why is there a charge being proposed here? Something more constructive would be to link grant aid, particularly now at the start, to bringing people up to a particular standard. That would be more welcome than the threat of inspection fees. Which comes first the inspection or the opening of a centre or what is the time scale? I assume it is like a Bord Fáilte approval and that within a certain amount of time one's premises must get accreditation.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that education is not being covered. It is noted in the Minister's speech that the Bill only covers those who provide adventure activities on a commercial basis. It does not cover schools or educational establishments and the Minister has said that it is a complex area. Schools get involved in adventure activities but far too little is done. The Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children are talking about looking at having schools included in the definition. This cannot happen soon enough. While the matter will probably require detailed investigation it should really have been taken on now and should not be something to be considered after the authority has been set up.</P>
    <P>The new regulations will perhaps make schools, particularly the less well off ones, unwilling to undertake adventure activities. I am very worried about this. The point was made that disadvantaged schools would lose out because of the cost of inspections. I look at that from the angle that we may compromise safety where it is needed most, if we do not include schools. Schools will provide activities, not on a commercial basis, so <Col N="889" /> they will not have to comply with the safety standards prescribed for commercial activities. Is a death worth a break in safety provision? Is it not worth bringing these people in under the regulations? We compromise safety where it is most needed if we exclude schools and it is exclusively our young people in the school environment who will suffer rather than the commercial operators whose very existence is based on displays of safety. Any cross-departmental review must happen soon.</P>
    <P>Schools should engage in more adventure activity. Seaside schools should have access to marine adventure facilities. This should be looked at by the Departments of Health and Children, Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Education and Science, and the Marine and Natural Resources. For safety purposes, they should be run on a commercial basis as those concerned maintain their name by ensuring good standards. When I was at school, our annual adventure day was a ten mile walk to Creagh for charity. Most participants avoided the full walk by taking a short-cut when the teacher was not looking. That is no longer the case in schools. I was involved in Healthy Eating Week and believe that we should look after our children and their health by encouraging them into action. We are aware of the statistics on obesity and that people complain about the lack of facilities for children. However, many children are not culturally attuned to existing sports and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>When I taught in England, the teaching year started on the last day in August and ran to the last week in July. A week was designated in June or July for all children and teachers to be involved in adventure activities. Depending on their means, they went skiing, hiking or engaged in equestrian, marine or other activities. It was healthy because the children learned teamwork. They worked together and got to know the teachers in a different light.</P>
    <P>The cross-Border aspect is important. The June 1999 report examined facilities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. I taught in Coleraine where there were good facilities and the school used the nearby outdoor adventure centres. I live close to Coleraine and once the car ferry to Magilligan, for which I thank the Minister, is operational next Easter, we can be there in 20 minutes. The location of County Donegal shows that we need all-Ireland links on safety. People living in my region do not recognise borders, just distances to the nearest facilities. I live on the Foyle, which is administered by both jurisdictions. There must also be plans for rivers on which so many activities take place, such as angling, boating and yachting and which are used by adventure centres, commercial traffic, cruise liners, rescue boats and so on. Plans must include all interests. The Foyle is a good example of the need for co-ordinated regulations. I suggest that the authority becomes an all-island one.</P>
    <P>On the question of facilities, there are opportunities in Inishowen for hill walking, swimming, <Col N="890" /> raft racing, water skiing, jet skiing, canoeing and yachting. Many happen haphazardly and would benefit by being co-ordinated with hotels to be sold as packages alongside equestrian activities and golf. I thank the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources for the leisure study and the infrastructural development. The Ministers, Deputies Woods and Fahey, were the first to invest seriously in infrastructural development in County Donegal for decades.</P>
    <P>Council studies show that there is an interest in public-private developments. On the Swilly, Foyle and north coast, perhaps at Bunargy Harbour, marinas should be utilised to generate employment and money. A focus is needed. We suffer from chicken and egg syndrome &ndash; without facilities we have no tourism and without tourism we have no facilities. However, Gartan is a good example of what can be done. Water based activities are a healthy option for all ages.</P>
    <P>Life is unhealthy for many who have no peace of mind, let alone physical well-being. The legislation is important because physical activities must have standards. The loss of Mr. Davies and the subsequent campaign must lead to some tangible benefit for other families committed to outdoor pursuits. We can introduce regulations but only the operators of adventure centres and participants can ensure safety. We cannot force them but can assist with regulations. It is unfortunate that it requires a stick and not a carrot but the authority will play a major part in the development of adventure activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely, important Bill. I took part in most of these activities at various levels. They are called adventure activities because they take place in the wild away from artificial environments. Today, young people, usually the participants, should be encouraged and helped to become involved. There are 13 activities listed in the Bill &ndash; hill walking, orienteering, caving, dinghy sailing, kayaking, canoeing, surfing with a surfboard, windsurfing, scuba diving, snorkelling, abseiling, archery and rock climbing. They are fun but there is also risk or danger which contributes to the excitement and fun. The Bill is important in ensuring that risk is measured and people are not placed in grave danger of injury or loss of life. There must be standards in order that there can be fun, risk and adventure but also safety. We must not overdo matters or we will lose the fun that risk brings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people, especially men, like physical challenge and to be tested. These activities test endurance and physical and mental ability. They help develop character and some involve teamwork. They are important and I support any measure introduced by any Minister or Government to support and develop them to enable as many as possible to participate. I support section 14 which states that some of the authority's functions are to promote, encourage, foster and facilitate activities and measures directed towards the safe operation of adventure activities. I welcome <Col N="891" /> this as I do the next part which states that a function is to administer schemes, grants and other financial facilities for the promotion, encouragement, fostering, facilitation and regulation of the safe operation of adventure activities as may be authorised from time to time by the Minister. The authority will provide an important framework for channelling resources and grants to develop these activities. We must ensure the resources and moneys are put in place to enable them to be developed. We will keep a close eye on this when the authority is established.</P>
    <P>An adventure activities operator is defined as a person who provides services for members of the public for payment or reward. The Minister should examine this on Committee Stage as a person could provide these services for free. Is there a loophole there? Perhaps we should delete the words &ldquo;for payment or reward&rdquo;. There is another danger there because if &ldquo;amateurs&rdquo; provide training and instruction free of charge, there is a greater risk of danger, accident or injury because somebody who is not trained is providing the activity. I do not know how one can get around this. If somebody has a couple of canoes, decides to take people out in them on a Sunday and has no training, they will not be covered by this Bill unless they get paid. There is a greater risk that might lead to injury or death. That is an issue at which we will have to look very carefully.</P>
    <P>I am a bit disappointed that schools have not been linked in here. The Department of Education and Science will have a person on the authority when it is set up but I would like to see a way in which schools could be assisted in developing these activities. Very often young people will only be exposed to these activities through the school. If they are lucky enough to have a teacher who has a personal interest or involvement in one or more of these activities, that teacher will very often give his or her free time to take the students away at weekends or out in the evenings to expose them to these activities. We need a framework where such teachers can be helped and assisted. There are two problems here. First, very often schools do not have the resources to develop these activities and, second, there is a problem with insurance.</P>
    <P>One school a number of years ago set up a sailing club. It trained the students not only to sail the dinghies, but to make them &ndash; the dinghies were constructed in the school as part of the programme. There was much learning &ndash; one could not calculate the amount of learning that took place from start to finish. The programme had to be suspended because the school could not get insurance cover. This is an issue at which we have to look and I hope the authority will take it on board when it is set up.</P>
    <P>Some colleagues alluded to the fact that jet skiing, water skiing, sand buggying and so on are not included. These activities are causing some concern. I am not saying we should stop them because people should have the right to use their <Col N="892" /> jet skis, water skis and so on but others have the right to enjoy the beach and the water without the intrusion and the fear some of these activities can cause. Perhaps there is some way to segregate the different activities that occur around our coast. Jet skiing has to be included in this legislation because it is an adventure activity and it can be a dangerous one if the wrong people are involved.</P>
    <P>I compliment members of the Defence Forces who have given their time to develop adventure activities down through the years. Many soldiers use adventure activities, such as orienteering and hill walking, to train people, while sailors use activities such as snorkelling. Often young people will become involved in these activities and will possibly join the Defence Forces as a result of being exposed to and taking part in these activities. I acknowledge the great amount of expertise in the Defence Forces in regard to many of these activities. I would like to see a way this expertise could be tapped into. Down through the years the FCA and An Slua Muirí have got involved in these activities. Members who are civilians and not full-time soldiers or sailors have taken part in many of these activities through membership of the FCA and An Slua Muirí. Perhaps there is a way to acknowledge that and to link it into the Bill. Maybe a member of the Defence Forces could be appointed to the authority. We should at least acknowledge that the expertise is there. Many of these activities are linked to the work soldiers and sailors do. It is an area that should not be ignored and should be tapped into if at all possible.</P>
    <P>We set up authorities &ndash; there is a plethora of them &ndash; but when Deputies want to get information about them and what they do and ask the Minister a question in this democratic assembly, the Minister says he is no longer responsible, that the authority is responsible. When we go to the authority, it says it does not have to answer a Deputy and that we have no right to the information. I know authorities may be called before committees once or twice a year, but it is something about which we need to be very careful. I would like a mechanism to be put in place where Ministers can give information without being responsible. Although the authority would still be responsible, the information could be made available by way of parliamentary question. This is possible in other jurisdictions and it is something all parties and Ministers should take into account. Many such authorities are being set up and are doing excellent work but we must remember there is a democratic process and that we are democratically elected. If an authority works on behalf of the State, we, as Deputies, should have the right to come into this assembly and ask Ministers pertinent questions about what the authority is or is not doing and receive a reply in the normal way as we do for other parliamentary questions. This is not happening, and I will keep repeating this. I am not saying the Minister should be responsible as that responsibility has been given <Col N="893" /> to the authority, I am talking about information which is very powerful and important.</P>
    <P>I would like a better youth service to be developed. We need to have a professional youth service and centres throughout the country and we now have the resources to do that. The Youth Work Bill passed through the House. This authority should link in with the youth service &ndash; I have noticed that there is no link at the moment. I know there are links with various Departments and that we cannot have an authority that is too big. I welcome the fact that the Ministers for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Education and Science will have representatives on the authority, which is important. We also need to have a representative who has expertise in youth work. Perhaps the member appointed on the recommendation of the Minister for Education and Science should be involved in youth work. We also have to take into account the role of schools. I am trying to ensure nobody is left out, that we can tap into all the expertise and resources and that the work of this authority reaches all those who need it.</P>
    <P>The register of operators seems only to take account of those who are doing this work for hire or reward. Perhaps there is a loophole there which we need to consider. I notice that the Department of Health and Children is not included. Many of the activities mentioned in the Bill and others which I am sure will be added to the list in the future are healthy activities and people taking part in them will have to have a certain level of physical fitness. It is good for all of us to get out and about in the fresh air from time to time. Deputies cannot find the time to do that because they spend so much time here and doing political work elsewhere, but it is something all of us should do.</P>
    <P>Young men particularly like a physical challenge and to be tested. I note with alarm that suicide is now the greatest killer of young men in Ireland. Involvement in activities such as these builds people's self-confidence and self-esteem. That is why it is so important to develop facilities and encourage as many as possible to use them. These activities should not be confined to an elite who are lucky enough to have a teacher, parent or neighbour who has a personal interest in these activities. Youth clubs, schools and so on should also be exposed to them. Given that it is more and more dangerous to cycle on roads because of the number of cars and the speed at which they travel, we need to make it possible for more and more people, older people as well as young people, to get involved in these activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that this Bill is before the House. It is not before time, and I am saddened by the circumstances which brought it about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February 1995, two young men, Ros Davies and Keith Crowley, were drowned in Dunmore East while taking part in a canoeing exercise at an adventure centre there. It was soon clear that, in <Col N="894" /> common with many other activities involving a high degree of risk, the so-called adventure centres needed to be regulated to copper fasten whatever safety features existed and minimum requirements imposed on the people who operate them.</P>
    <P>In October of that year, I was approached by Ros's father, Michael, who asked me to raise the matter of the regulation of these centres in the light of his own experience. Shortly after that, Fianna Fáil were out of Government and the opportunity had passed. I discussed the possibility of introducing a Private Members' Bill in the House, but it was not pursued.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, in 1998, the then Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Michael Finucane, introduced legislation for which I commended him at the time. However, it ran to just nine sections and was wholly inadequate to cover all eventualities, while the more comprehensive one before the House today contains 37 sections and includes a schedule. Nevertheless, Deputy Finucane's contribution to bringing this legislation before the House should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>We as a legislature stand indicted that it was a full five years before we reacted to this tragedy which exposed gaps and flaws in the safety measures operating in these centres. I realise that since the Government came to office in June 1997, a great deal of necessary and positive legislation has been passed in this House, but perhaps our priorities are somewhat misplaced given that it has taken this long to have this Bill debated and advanced.</P>
    <P>The machinery of State has moved slowly, but I hope the introduction and passage of this Bill will lessen, in some small way, the pain and loss of the Davies and Crowley families and others who have lost family members in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem was in deciding which Department was responsible, whether as an educational area it should have been the Department of Education and Science, or whether as a water-based activity it should have been the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. In all of this, there is an element of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, but it may be of some consolation to the families of the bereaved that this new measure will considerably improve standards and eliminate problems before they can affect users of the centres. This is borne out by the fact that, Ministers for Education and Science, Tourism Sport and Recreation and Marine and Natural Resources and other interests in this area will all nominate members to the proposed new Adventure Activities Standards Authority. I agree with something Deputy Stanton said about the various authorities. They have come to be at arm's length from the Oireachtas and we often cannot get answers from them. Many such authorities are very good, but they must be made more accountable to the Members of this House who represent the people.</P>
    <P>Adventure centres, sports and leisure centres, summer camps and specialised sports camps are <Col N="895" /> a very positive part of life in today's world. They encourage and promote sport at all levels and ages, as well as general activity and exercise. They are a good all round contributor to good health in our community.</P>
    <P>For too long, we were a sedentary society, but with increased health education and sound advice, with the increased wealth and leisure time the modern economy provides for us, we now engage far more in sport and other active pursuits. That is to be welcomed and expanded on. Any extra money we can invest in sport and leisure will be returned to us ten-fold through savings in the health service.</P>
    <P>I returned within the past hour from a meeting of the Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation which met for two and a half hours this morning with the chief executive of the Irish Sports Council, Mr. John Treacy, and other members of the staff of the council. The value of investing in sport as a tool for the prevention of bad health was raised. Such benefits are not tangible. It is very difficult to quantify the savings on health that result from spending money on sport. At a conference which I opened in Waterford on Tuesday morning, one of the points I made was that investing more in young people would keep them out of prison and that if we educated them properly they would become an asset to the community. Again, as it cannot be quantified in monetary terms, it is difficult to convince the powers that be that investment in sport will have important knock-on effects in the future in terms of the nation's health.</P>
    <P>That said, we do not want increased participation in sport with its consequent benefits to health at any price. If we are to teach our young people anything, the primary lesson should be the importance of safety at all times. Allied to that is the duty of care which centre operators, coaches and supervisors bear towards their clients. If this is not guaranteed through the industry itself, we as a Government, with the overall good of the people in mind, must remind those in charge that care and safety are still paramount in any industry or field of activity.</P>
    <P>As in many other areas of private business, self-regulation did not work in this case, despite the recommendations put forward by the Marine National Surveyors Office in the wake of the Dunmore East accident. The Bill is not totally related to marine activities but, broadly speaking, it can be, and I will confine my contribution to this area.</P>
    <P>As a point of principle, I am not normally in favour of licensing or regulating everything in sight. However, in too many cases we have seen private industry cut corners, reduce standards or otherwise fall short of the kind of safe and comprehensive service which the people expect and to which they are entitled. Adventure centres have a potential for disaster, and it is fitting that we should now ensure, in so far as it is possible, that there will not be a repetition of the Dunmore <Col N="896" /> East accident. I am not suggesting that there is something wrong with adventure centres. However, of their nature, they generate a high degree of risk which must be acknowledged and catered for. There must be a body to impose standards if operators do not implement them themselves. That is what is provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>People, even those who consider themselves experts in their field, cannot be relied upon to apply the common sense and high standards which are necessary in a risk-filled activity. If they did, the rescue helicopters would not be scouring the mountains and seas as often as they do for people who have not exercised the correct level of planning, care and common sense. We have seen all too clearly in the dunes of Tramore, just a handful of miles from Dunmore East, the risks which the rescue services have to take in responding to calls and the price that sometimes has to be paid in the discharge of their duties. I pay tribute to all who operate the rescue services and who regularly put themselves in harm's way in the service of others.</P>
    <P>Now that what passes for summer in this country has arrived, I endorse the message which goes out from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government each year regarding safe bathing and boating. It takes just a little common sense on the part of those who indulge in these sports, whether water-based or in the mountains, to take the recommended precautions, to apply a little common sense and to have concern for others. Our annual record in regard to these pursuits leaves a lot to be desired, but like road safety, with a little more thought and consideration, a great many tragedies could be avoided.</P>
    <P>We have developed a reputation for fine sporting facilities here, and rightly so. Traditionally it was horse racing, but more recently the development of top class golf courses has drawn more and more high spenders to our country. These people have much to offer us, not only in foreign revenue, but also in enhancing our reputation among other holiday makers abroad. We have long since entered the leisure age and more and more people are turning to sport and physical activity to fill their leisure time. These activities range from the leisurely and relatively safe game of golf to mountaineering, hill walking and water sports. Where these services are being provided by an operator, whether in the public or private sector, the public is entitled to expect the highest standards of safety and care. Those who frequent these activity centres are often primary or secondary school students and depend entirely on the operators and their own supervisors to keep them safe and advised of all the risks involved in their sport.</P>
    <P>I am glad more and more trained personnel are becoming available for this purpose. There are several good colleges which are turning out graduates who will raise the standards in the industry if they are given the opportunity. I pay tribute to those colleges which offer recreation management and health and safety courses and <Col N="897" /> those which are specially tailored for the leisure industry &ndash; in this respect the recreation management department of Waterford Institute of Technology has been a leader in its field and its graduates are in great demand even before they qualify. They have pioneered this form of education and training in this country and have a proud record in the field. They have raised standards and brought a degree of realism and professionalism to the industry which had not existed before. Pay and conditions in the leisure industry often leave a lot to be desired. Perhaps it is because employers expect their staff to particularly enjoy their line of work that they feel they can impose the kind of rosters, holiday arrangements and conditions which would not be tolerated in any other area of employment.</P>
    <P>This is comprehensive legislation for which I commend the Minister. I note that further measures can be introduced under its provisions by means of ministerial order if deemed necessary. The Minister proposes to give the authority adequate powers to discharge its functions and has rightly placed the investigation and reporting of accidents and incidents clearly in its hands. This will be an authority which will have the necessary expertise, which will be representative of all the appropriate interests and which will have all the necessary powers available to it. My one fear is that of the 15 members on the new authority, eight members &ndash; a majority &ndash; will represent the various activity bodies and operators, some of which have shown in the past that they were not capable of enforcing or implementing recommendations previously made. Bearing that in mind, I wonder if the Minister is satisfied as to the independence of this body. I suggest that the Minister should consider including Michael Davies among his nominees, as he is one of the people who has inspired the legislation.</P>
    <P>The penalties provided for under section 5 seem adequate and appropriate and it is heartening to see that there will be proper and meaningful sanctions for offences in this area. I am pleased also with the provisions of section 15, whereby additional functions can be given to the authority if the Minister so decides. Section 16 confers the power to investigate accidents and to produce a report which is to be published. This did not exist before and while there are formal agencies which could investigate death or serious injury, there was no dedicated investigatory body which had the expertise necessary to discharge its function fully or make the recommendations envisaged in this legislation or reach the decisive conclusion which this new body can do. Coroners' inquests, for instance, are confined merely to establishing the cause, time and place of death and, with the exception of one recommendation, have very little scope to influence or dictate change in any area. This has been borne out too often in the past, particularly where large numbers of people have been involved in an incident <Col N="898" /> causing death and where juries have expressed their frustration at the inadequacy of the system.</P>
    <P>Publication of the findings of the authority in a report is a new and necessary departure. Too often in the past such reports did not see the light of day but that is now history and, with safeguards for those who might be criticised and blamed, everything will now be in the public domain. The much proclaimed openness and transparency has to be part of any new procedures and I commend the Minister for going as far as he has.</P>
    <P>There is also provision for a tribunal of inquiry and while we have more than our fair share of tribunals and investigations at present, it may be necessary in the future to appoint such a tribunal which can call on wide-ranging powers.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides for the development of a code of practice for the safe operation of these adventure activity centres and I am pleased this is mandatory. I expect most operators will behave in a responsible manner but there are always rogue and cowboy operators. It behoves everyone in the industry to root them out as they do the industry no favours by remaining in operation. Section 35 provides for the carrying out of inspections, with power to have an activity or centre suspended or put out of business altogether by removing the centre from the register of operators. Too often in the past we have introduced legislation which remains on the Statute Book but is not enforced. There is no point in bringing in such legislation and I hope this Act will be enforced. I hope the inspectors appointed will be extremely vigilant, that a sufficient number of them is appointed and that enough resources are put into tackling this issue so that the regulations are enforced.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation and I hope it will not take too long to have it enacted, especially with the summer looming ahead of us. We do not want to see more tragedies like those we have seen in the past. We have been very slow in bringing this legislation forward but thankfully it is now here. It is my wish that this Bill passes all Stages quickly. That is necessary if it is to come into force before the summer. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of this important Bill. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Finucane, who brought this matter to the attention of the House during Private Members' time just over two years ago and the Bill largely results from his dedication. I favour the principle behind the introduction of the Adventure Activities Standard Authority and I am anxious that it be put in place before the summer months when the vast majority of adventure activities take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of reservations concerning this legislation, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the standard authority to be established. I wish to raise the basic matter of the definition of adventure activities, which has been discussed <Col N="899" /> by other Deputies. Members are aware of the activities that have been listed, which include a number of water adventure sports. Certain obvious water sports such as jet-skiing and water-skiing have not been included, however. I cannot reconcile the imposition of regulations to control windsurfing, surfing and canoeing with the failure to include water-skiing and jet-skiing. If there is a valid reason, I will be happy to hear it. Many of the activity centres we are attempting to regulate provide services for sports not included in the Bill. Many activity centres that teach people to windsurf also provide jet-skis on the beach for recreational use. The Bill needs to be more encompassing in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of adventure activity that need to be covered such as a vast array of equine sports from eventing to pony-trekking along roads. We cannot put in place an Adventure Activities Standard Authority without taking equine sports into account as such activity is one of the fastest growing in Ireland. I listened to my colleague, Deputy Dukes, with some amusement last night when he said that bungee jumping appals him. I ask him not to knock it until he tries it as it certainly involves&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;an adrenaline rush. I also want to mention sports such as gliding, hang-gliding and especially microlighting, a sport which is entirely unregulated. There was a tragic accident involving a microlight in Cork about ten days ago when a young person was killed by the aircraft's motor. We, therefore, need to consider an expansion of the remit of the Bill. We could establish an authority to look after watersports and another to look after land and air based sports. If we attempt to look after all adventure activity, the definition of such activity needs to be more encompassing.</P>
      <P>My main concern with the Bill relates to watersports. As one who grew up on the water, was taught how to canoe, windsurf and sail and spent many summers teaching others how to sail, I am somewhat qualified to make informed observations about potential negative aspects that could result if certain questions are not dealt with on Committee and Report Stages. I favour the establishment of a safety standards authority for activity centres, but I am concerned with how the body will perform its function and who will constitute it. It is necessary that we should require adventure activity operators to register with an authority. This would ensure there were common safety standards and common assessment procedures throughout the country. Powers must be given to the authority to impose penalties if it is not satisfied with a code of conduct or its implementation. We owe such procedures to children and adults who participate in adventure activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems may arise when codes of safety conduct are being devised and enforced by the safety authority. We must not put in place a rigid code <Col N="900" /> with inflexible rules, applying to all centres. It is important to remember that different centres have different risk levels, depending on geographical location, staffing qualifications and available equipment or facilities. If the standard authority is to introduce a code of conduct, it must demonstrate the flexibility to tailor the code to the needs of individual centres. That is the most important point I wish to make. It should be noted that there are very successful codes of practice in many centres. Any new code introduced must complement what is already in place, possibly with an excellent record.</P>
    <P>Such flexibility is needed in kayaking, for example. The Irish Canoe Union recommends a safety ratio of one instructor to six students as a general rule, but many activity centres use their own guideline of one instructor to ten students. The latter ratio can be far safer if the group is enclosed in a sheltered and relatively safe harbour, compared to one instructor to six students in an open beach or out at sea. When a code of conduct is put in place, the authority must look at the individual circumstances of each activity centre rather than trying to impose a blunt common standard across the board. If such a blunt standard is imposed, life will be made difficult for private operators. In certain circumstances, matters will not be any safer, an avoidable double negative.</P>
    <P>Let us consider, as an example, a summer sailing course in Cork Harbour with approximately 80 or 90 students. The ratio of teachers to pupils required may be far less than that needed in Rosses Point, which is open to the elements and the sea. I hope the Minister will allay my concerns by taking on board my opinion that tailor-made codes of conduct for individual centres, taking into account the codes already in operation, are an essential part of implementing the Bill in a practical way. We must not simply seek to be seen to implement strict codes of conduct and safety.</P>
    <P>By focusing on the tough setting and enforcement of rules and regulations, we are missing the point somewhat. The overall goal must be the creation of a safer environment in which adventure activities can take place. A greater emphasis must be put on the promotion and retention of a greater safety ethos and awareness, rather than the enforcement of inflexible guidelines and rules. Clear and well founded evidence suggests that most accidents happen between lessons, for example, at lunchtime when water fights take place or when people run up and down the pontoon, not during a structured lesson. To prove this point to myself, I contacted a busy activity centre in my constituency which has records for the past five years of all accidents, large and small, that happened during courses. Not a single accident happened while the structured course was taking place on the water. All the accidents happened either before or after it when the instruction is relaxed.</P>
    <P>For example, people slipped on stones on the beach on the way down to the water and broke <Col N="901" /> their leg or arm, people slipped in the shower and cut themselves or accidents happened when people were messing around in the boats, having water fights or when they went snorkelling after dark. The emphasis in the Bill must be on the creation of a safety ethos rather than on implementing tight, rigid rules on pupil-instructor ratio or on times and limits on the number of people who can go into the water. That is a crucial point that cannot be emphasised enough.</P>
    <P>I and people to whom I spoke about this Bill are of the opinion that the awareness of risk is perhaps the most effective way to prevent accidents. The promotion of the awareness of risk can only happen through promoting and retaining an ethos of safety in activity centres across the country rather than through the enforcement of rules. While some rules need to apply, it is much more important that a safety ethos is created in these centres.</P>
    <P>If we overdo it on the rules, there is a chance we will kill the fun of the activity. Like the previous speaker, I am not a great fan of imposing rules and regulations for the sake of doing so. We should be sensitive in how we impose rules and how strict we are on doing so to ensure we do not kill the fun of an adventure activity, given that, after all, adventure activity is about adventure. That is why such activities are popular. Such activities will always carry an element of danger, but it is a question of an acceptable risk and of ensuring people are informed of the risk before they take it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the powers of the authority, my colleague, Deputy Dukes, said that he had concerns that an authority with responsibility for safety and implementing a code of practice would also be responsible for the promotion and encouragement of adventure activity. I disagree with him on that point. It makes sense for the one authority to promote safety and implement safety regulations because if the one authority is responsible for both, that presents a better opportunity of creating a safety ethos when promoting sport. I welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>In relation to the make-up of the 15 member authority, it is important the authority is representative of all those who are involved in this area. Unlike a previous speaker, I do not have a problem with a majority of the membership representing private activity centres. It is important they do not perceive this authority as a threat but as a helping hand for safety. From my experience of having been involved in a number of activity centres, they have an extremely responsible attitude towards safety. Given the support of Government, financially and from an advice point of view, their membership on the authority will be positive and I am pleased they will have eight members on it. I agree with Deputy Stanton who said the safety services, the Irish Coastguard Service or perhaps the RNLI, which know more about marine rescue than anybody else, should also be represented.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a point that I always seek to <Col N="902" /> make in the context of legislation when it is relevant. The promotion of water sports generally here has been under-resourced. The greatest resource this country has is the water that surrounds it. We have a collection of harbours, inlets, beaches and coastline that is almost unparalleled in Europe. I would like the Government, through this body, to promote, financially and in any way it can, activity on the water, as it is a positive activity for young men and women to partake in. It is healthy and with the right safety regulation it can continue to grow very successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. Having listened to Deputy Coveney, the expert on this area, I note many of the points I wanted to make were extremely well made by him.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the introduction of this Bill. It follows through on a goal the Minister set himself when he was a mere Minister of State at the Department of Education where he was instrumental in setting up many of the outdoor pursuit centres, particularly under the VEC system. Some of his work is now bearing fruit in the form of this Bill, although it is important we tease it out.</P>
      <P>The voluntary code AFAS and others put in place several years ago cannot be ignored. As Deputy Coveney said, it is important to ensure a sensible balance is struck between the sense of adventure people can rightly derive from being involved in adventure sports and the manageable risk they should or should not be encouraged to take. I endorse the creation of a safer environment, which Deputy Coveney spoke about. We have all visited centres, inland and at the seaside, throughout the country where standards have varied. There is no point in pretending there is a uniform standard. The safety ethos we would like to pertain to the operation of these centres is not in place in some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many other speakers, on reading the Bill, the first thing that struck me was the list of adventure activities in section 8. Since I was elected here in 1997 I have spoken on occasion about the dangers associated with jet skiing. I am disappointed it is not included in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>m</i>) of section 8(1). As Deputy Coveney said, there may be a good reason for not including it, but from the point of view of safety and insurance, there is arguably a good case for including it and I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of doing so. Similarly, I cannot understand why water skiing cannot be included in that list from day one. White water rafting, which those who participate in it do not always get an opportunity to do here, is becoming increasingly popular here among young people who have been canoeing or kayaking and want a further sense of adventure. The inclusion of that activity in the list should also be considered. Parachute jumping, microlighting and paragliding should also be included in that list, if for no other reason than to highlight <Col N="903" /> that the Department is anxious to promote a very high standard of safety in these activities.</P>
    <P>I was in Finland last year and witnessed first hand the rigorous standards regime applied to such sports there. It did not dissipate the sense of fun for people who were participating in a wide range of adventure sports which I saw there.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the debate which needs to be looked at, that is, the use of safety equipment by students engaging in activities like this. Often I am amazed when I see young people canoeing without helmets or lifejackets. To be fair to the Government, and, in particular, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his Minister of State, Deputy Davern, there has been a development, particularly in urban areas, in recent years to set up pony clubs with support from that Department. By and large the standards applied to the use of horses by inexperienced young people is high, but it would be useful if we ensured that regulations are in place to protect inexperienced people getting involved in the equine industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the register of centres mentioned in the Bill. Coming from a teaching background and having been involved in youth work for years, I am inclined to be more rigid about registration than other people might be. One issue which concerns me is that there does not seem to be insistence on a baseline standard for the registration of centres. It is important to look at issues like the qualification of staff, the suitability of staff and the suitability of premises. The qualifications issue has been improved year on year because there are good post leaving certificate courses being run in further education colleges and in some of the institutes of technology throughout the country, but the suitability of personnel needs to be looked at from another point of view. Somewhere in the Bill, I would like to see some reference to the importance of child protection guidelines in the management and operation of any centre. I cannot understand why that cannot be emphasised more.</P>
    <P>While I am on the issue of staff in centres like this, we need to look at the pay and conditions of staff. Often staff have been paid paltry wages. Some centres operated by vocational education committees throughout the country have had no choice but to operate under the community employment scheme and, therefore, the staff are paid low wages, they have poor tenure of office and the conditions are not great. That is certainly something which needs to be looked at by the authority when it is set up.</P>
    <P>The powers of investigation and monitoring of centres are crucial. I am pleased to see in the Bill that inspectors can visit without notice and call for any or all of the records of a centre on accidents, levels of personnel, time tables of activities, etc. That is extremely important. The authority should not wait for an accident to happen before inspecting a centre. Undoubtedly the authority will not be able from day one to have a whole <Col N="904" /> raft of inspectors servicing it, but over a period mechanisms should be developed which will allow a core of qualified inspectors to drop in, sometimes on an advisory basis but sometimes in a quasi-inspectorial role, to look at ratios of instructors and back-up staff to participants, as Deputy Coveney has mentioned, and the level of insurance cover for activities. Issues like that need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The issue of investigations and special reports mentioned in section 16 is important and so too is the fact that the report will be published and therefore will be in the public domain. Often it has been very difficult for the relatives of people who have been involved in accidents to get the outcome of reports from the competent authorities so I am extremely happy to welcome that provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Judging by its composition, it will be a wide ranging and balanced authority. However, the Minister might look at sections 10 and 11, which are about the establishment of the authority itself and about the nominees and the various Departments which should be involved in it. It is important that the national governing bodies of adventure sports would be involved but the National Sports Council, as the statutory body involved in sports, ought to have at least one nominee on that authority. It is, after all, the body which will be setting standards, laying out qualifications for staff for a variety of sports activities and monitoring the implementation of guidelines across a range of areas. It is advisable that it be included in the membership of the authority.</P>
    <P>The one area with which I am inclined to take issue is that the Bill covers only those adventure centres or activities run on a commercial basis. The Minister said the Bill does not cover schools or other educational establishments and that this is a complex area. Schools ought to be included as schools, particularly post-primary schools, are now running a wide range of sports related activities. Adventure sports form the core of many programmes like the leaving certificate applied and post-leaving certificate courses. The activities on offer include canoeing, hill-walking and rock-climbing, and increasingly students are engaging in these activities in a robust and vigorous way. Therefore, I would like the Minister, along with his colleague in the Department of Education and Science, to look at ways in which schools and youth clubs would be included within the remit of the Bill. For example, there are Youthreach centres and FÁS training centres which provide activities of this nature. Perhaps the equipment used by some of these schools and centres is not of the highest quality but that does not mean some form of grant aid assistance ought not be made available to these schools to up-grade them. The Bill provides an opportunity to increase standards across the board at a time when all aspects of physical education form part of the school curriculum. It would make a bold statement if we were to include schools and youth centres within the remit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> It is a significant Bill in the sports and outdoor pursuits area. No doubt it is expensive to operate adventure activity centres &ndash; they do not come cheaply. I am aware of a very fine centre with which I was associated in County Westmeath on the shores of Lake Derravaragh which had to close because of the rising cost of insurance linked with the activities like sailing, canoeing, horse-riding, etc., which it provided and because it simply was not able to pay trained staff high enough wages.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill be ratified as early as possible, certainly before the summer. It is also important that the authority is properly resourced and seen to have a certain degree of clout within the leisure industry. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. In the past as a PE teacher I have been involved in outdoor activities and therefore I am very familiar with the terrain, what is involved and the necessity for this Bill.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this Bill and I acknowledge the contribution made by my colleague, Deputy Finucane, when he introduced a Private Members' Bill in March 1999. I am confident the debate in the House at that time accelerated the process which saw the Minister bringing forward this Bill.</P>
      <P>More and more people are taking to the great outdoors in an effort to escape the stresses of modern living, traffic congestion and pollution. They undertake outdoor activities to rejuvenate and energise themselves and to be at one with nature. As our society becomes more urbanised, the number of people attracted to spend time in rural areas will increase and this will also bring an increase in the number of outdoor activity centres, which have an economic as well as an educational value. Operators are capitalising on the economic advantage of outdoor activity centres.</P>
      <P>This Bill is opportune and important. I agree with Deputy Coveney that we have never fully capitalised on our unique natural environment. Tourists come to Ireland because of our culture and our natural environment. Deputy Coveney has particular experience of coastal areas and he says that we have never capitalised on the potential of our coastal areas. We have a vast resource in our coastal zone, which is accessible from all parts of the country. We have not done enough to develop aquaculture and mariculture, nor have we exploited that advantage from a recreational point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is specific in that it provides for the definition of adventure activities and provision to cater for amendments at a later stage. It defines adventure activity operators and sets up the Adventure Activities Standards Authority. The Bill does not mention the adventure activity participant. There should be some clause in this Bill that would require participants to have medical <Col N="906" /> clearance. If an asthmatic does not inform the instructor of a scuba-diving course, for example, of his condition, it could lead to problems. A person with cardiac problems should probably avoid climbing steep hills. A medical certificate from a doctor would help in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects of the Bill which I presume will be amended at a later stage. There are three major issues which need to be addressed and to which I draw the Minister's attention. Section 8(1) lists the activities which are covered. This list must be expanded to include raft building, an adventurous activity practised in most multi-activity centres and which is of particular concern to the Outdoor Education Ireland group. Raft building is defined as the construction of a vessel from ropes, spars and buoyancy tanks, for the purpose of supporting two members above the water line, and is capable of being manoeuvred along a waterway. I ask the Minister to include raft building in any review of the list of activities.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with charges which the authority may make for the provision of its services. The Outdoor Education Ireland group recommend that no fees or charges should be made against the operators. The authority will require funding for its operation but the operators do not wish to be obliged to raise their charges to pay the running costs of the authority.</P>
    <P>The four nominees to the authority from the adventure activity operators are specified to include two nominees from the private sector and two from the public sector. That commitment was given originally and I suggest that the Minister look at this again when he is considering the make-up of the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 8 outlines the definition of adventure activities and a total of 13 activities are listed. That should be expanded. The definitions of hill walking and orienteering should be amended to say &ldquo;remote or wilderness areas&rdquo;, rather than areas more than 300 metres above sea level, which is a restrictive definition. The activity of gorge walking should also be included. It is a popular activity in the Reeks area of Kerry and it can be a dangerous activity.</P>
    <P>Section 9 allows the authority to specify the location and the criteria to be used for centres and for their equipment. Equipment for hire should not be included in this set of criteria because EU standards already exist. Equipment can vary from centre to centre and this should be taken into account. Section 9(1)<i>(c) </i>requires clarification. If the operator provides just one activity governed by the authority, does that mean that the operator is exempt? Section 14 outlines the function of the authority. A number of speakers expressed concern about subsection (7).</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that out of £24 billion sterling in deposits held in Isle of Man banks in 2000, over £4 billion was held by the Isle of Man branches of Irish banks; if, in view of the repeated indications arising at the tribunals of Isle of Man accounts being used for tax evasion purposes, he will now agree to establish an investigation into the efficacy and purposes of these accounts in order to minimise the possibility of them being used for tax evasion purposes.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14306/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): I am aware that the figures referred to and which I understand are based on a recent report by a leading accountancy firm have been put into the public domain. It would not be reasonable to conclude that these global figures for Isle of Man deposits, held by branches of Irish banks, represent a scale of tax evasion by Irish residents using such accounts. First, these branches may deal with both Irish residents and persons not resident here. Second, they will deal with international corporate depositors. Third, there are many legitimate reasons Irish customers, personal and corporate, will have funds deposited abroad. The Deputy is aware there are many billions of pounds deposited in Ireland from abroad on a legitimate basis.</P>
    <P>Any use of offshore accounts for tax evasion purposes is clearly a concern. Arising from the various revelations in recent years the Moriarty tribunal has been asked to make whatever recommendations it considers necessary or expedient &ldquo;for maintaining the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions while at the same time ensuring the greatest degree of openness and accountability in that regard that is consistent with the right to privacy of compliant taxpayers&rdquo; and &ldquo;for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts, and to recommend whether any changes in the tax laws should be made to achieve this end&rdquo;. The tribunal was also asked to make whatever recommendations it considers necessary or expedient &ldquo;for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally.&rdquo;  As this whole issue is within the remit of the Moriarty tribunal, it would seem appropriate to allow the tribunal to complete its task in this regard.</P>
    <P>The use of havens for the facilitation of tax evasion is a worldwide problem which is being actively tackled on a number of fronts internationally, particularly by the European Union and the OECD.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; response to a manifest problem. We do not have to be told that the Isle of Man is being used for tax evasion purposes. There has been much evidence through the tribunals to this effect. There have been bags of money brought in and out. It is a problem. I have before me the KPMG report. I put it to the banks at the DIRT inquiry&mdash;</P>

      <P>The banks have acknowledged that they have these sums in the Isle of Man. There is twice as much <i>per capita</i> from Ireland as the United Kingdom in the Isle of Man. Should this not ring alarm bells in the Department of Finance? Does the Minister agree that he should undertake an investigation or discussions with the banks as to whether they are the good corporate citizens they claim to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1992, in the context of the abolition of exchange control, Irish intermediaries &ndash; banks or professional advisers &ndash; who act for or assist Irish residents, individuals or companies in opening foreign bank accounts are obliged to make a return of this fact to Revenue. Irish residents are obliged to report the opening of foreign bank accounts to Revenue in their annual returns of income. Since 1974 Irish residents have been liable to income tax in respect of income arising from assets or moneys transferred abroad and certain information about such transfers may be sought by Revenue.</P>
      <P>Tax evasion is a worldwide problem. EU and OECD measures have been taken. As recently as last November we adopted the savings directive, the basis of which will be that member states will exchange information. There were various proposals but the final conclusion was that there should be a recommendation that member states exchange information.</P>
      <P>The EU Presidency and the Commission are to enter into key discussions with key third countries such as the United States, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino. Furthermore, all member states must commit themselves to the adoption of these measures in all relevant, dependent or associated territories such as the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and dependent and associated territories in the Caribbean. Recently, the OECD also drew up a report and made recommendations.</P>
      <P>This issue has been looked at on a worldwide basis. The EU savings directive will tackle the problem as the Isle of Man is a dependent or associated territory of the United Kingdom. There are legitimate reasons for many people having bank accounts abroad. In Ireland there are billions of pounds in the system from residents of other countries in legitimate operations. Irish residents are not permitted to have accounts in an IFSC company but accounts are held by residents of other countries.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister learned anything from the DIRT inquiry? The Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners sat idly by as the banks conspired in tax evasion. They now claim they are good corporate citizens. I want this tested because the evidence of the Isle of Man banking sector report by KPMG &ndash; review of accounts 2000 &ndash; shows that Irish banks have twice as much<i> per capita</i> on deposit in the Isle of Man as British banks. Is this not a cause for concern in view of the evidence from the tribunals? Would it not be prudent of the Minister to make some inquiries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Revenue Commissioners announced a statement of practice on 2 May 2001 on underlying tax on funds deposited in bogus non-resident accounts. Under the terms of the statement, Revenue indicated that they are setting a deadline of 15 November 2001 for bogus non-resident account holders to make a voluntary disclosure and pay the tax along with interest and penalties.</P>
      <P>I have answered a number of parliamentary questions in the past six month or so confirming to the House that Revenue was preparing guidelines on the issue. In this regard, I was aware that Revenue was pursuing its deliberations on the matter. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners informed me of the course of action that they had decided on and advised me before the recent announcement that they would be issuing a statement of practice on the underlying tax on funds deposited in bogus non-resident accounts. My approval for this course of action was not required as this falls within the ambit of responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are charged under tax law with the assessment and collection of taxes and levies imposed by the State. They are also entrusted by law with the duty of manag<Col N="910" /> ing the process in an efficient manner to secure the moneys for the State. This involves the making of judgments on an ongoing basis as to the best way to carry out their functions to discharge their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Those disclosing voluntarily will have to pay full tax owed. They will also have to pay interest and penalties up to 100% in order that no more than twice the tax due will be paid. The arrangement in the statement of practice falls within Revenue's care and management powers principally under section 849 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which allow it to deploy its resources to best effect in collecting taxes.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that those who availed of the Waivers of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, may also avail of the arrangements under the statement of practice. This does not apply to cases already under inquiry by Revenue on 2 May 2001 or coming within the scope of the Ansbacher investigations, the Flood tribunal or the Moriarty tribunal. Persons who did not properly avail of the 1993 Act will pay much higher amounts now if they come within the scope of the statement of practice.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for some time that the necessary job of pursuing the underlying tax due on income held in bogus non-resident accounts would be a mammoth task. There could be between 25,000 and 50,000 such account holders with arrears. To pursue each and every one of these solely on a case working basis would absorb considerable time and resources which would be drawn away from the ongoing work of collecting more than £23 billion in current taxes in 2001 alone.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The proposed approach is the most practical and effective way of dealing with the task, which is unprecedented in terms of scale. The sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts on DIRT recognised the practicalities of the situation and recommended in its final report of 30 March 2001 that the Revenue Commissioners &ldquo;give consideration to dealing with the assessment and collection of the underlying tax in a pragmatic and effective manner while safeguarding the overall tax revenue of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is sensible advice from sensible people which has been acted upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that making special arrangements in any circumstances for people who have systematically evaded tax sends out the wrong signals to those who are tax compliant? I agree with him that his approval legally and technically was not needed for the statement of practice, but nonetheless does he accept that he was informed? What view was proffered by him or on his behalf by his Department to the Revenue Commissioners before the statement of practice was announced on 2 May?</P>

      <P>My approval was not sought. I was informed by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners of the statement of practice. I subsequently informed the Government, which noted what I told it. That was the procedure. I asked the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners whether it had the legal power to do this and I was told that it had received legal advice before issuing the statement of practice.</P>
      <P>In the debate that has ensued, the members of the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts, chaired by Deputy Jim Mitchell, recognised the practicality of this and recommended in its final report of 30 March that the Revenue Commissioners should give consideration to dealing with the assessment and collection of the underlying tax in a pragmatic and effective manner while safeguarding the overall tax revenue of the State. This is sensible advice from sensible people, which has been acted upon.

      <P>I take the Minister's answer to mean that he approves of the statement of practice regardless of whether his approval was necessary. Section 9 of the Act relating to the 1993 amnesty provides for the creation of an offence in circumstances where people did not use the amnesty, where people used the amnesty but did not make full disclosure or where they used it but made false disclosure. How does the most recent statement of practice relate to people who, almost by definition, must have misused or not used the previous amnesty?</P>

This does not apply to cases already under inquiry by Revenue on 2 May 2001 or coming within the scope of the Ansbacher investigations, the Flood tribunal or the Moriarty tribunal.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a steering group from my Department, which included two members from the private sector, carried out a review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. It produced a report containing 48 recommendations involving corporate governance arrangements, accountability, Revenue's core business, organisation structures and support services, and management procedures. In particular, the review recommends the establishment of a new governing board of Revenue to replace the current statutory board, to comprise the current Revenue chairman, the other two Revenue commissioners and three independent non-executive directors, one of whom should be vice-chairman.</P>
      <P>The final report of the Committee of Public Accounts parliamentary inquiry into DIRT, which was published on 3 April last, considered the report of the steering group and recommended that the board of the Revenue Commissioners should have three executive and three non-executive members but that one of the non-executive members should be chairman. I am giving careful consideration to the recommendations in these two reports and as soon as I have completed my consideration of the issues involved, I will bring proposals to Government.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners advise me that they have already taken a number of measures to implement the steering group's recommendations in areas which do not require Government decisions. These recommendations are concerned with the extensive changes in the way Revenue is internally organised below board level and take account of Revenue's proposals following a root and branch review undertaken by them. My Department has sanctioned an extra 31 posts to provide the resources necessary to advance this work.</P>

      <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission consists of a chairperson and six ordinary members. Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, commissioners are required to have substantial experience and expertise at senior level in such areas as investment, finance, accountancy, the Civil Service, the pensions industry etc. While future commissioners will be appointed for five year terms, the Act provides for the appointment of the ordinary members of the first commission for terms of three and four years to ensure continuity as new commissioners are appointed.</P>
      <P>I appointed Mr. Donal Geaney as chairman of the commission, with a five year term of office. Mr. Geaney is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, has previously been a partner in KPMG and is now chairman and chief executive officer of Elan Corporation plc. Mr. Bob Curran was appointed commissioner with a four year term of office. Mr. Curran previously served for nearly 20 years as second secretary of the public expenditure division in the Department of Finance. Ms Bríd Horan was appointed to the commission with a three year term of office. Ms Horan has substantial experience in the pensions industry. She headed KPMG's pension and actuarial consulting business in Ireland before joining ESB in 1997 where she was general manager of pensions. Ms Horan is also an associate of the Institute of Actuaries.</P>

    <P>Dr. Martin Kohlhaussen was appointed to the commission for a four year term. Dr. Kohlhaussen has recently retired as chairman of <Col N="914" /> the board of managing directors of Commerzbank AG, a position he had held since 1991, having been a member of the board since 1982. Dr. Kohlhaussen previously worked internationally in banking as branch manager in Tokyo and New York. He also holds a law degree. Mr. Donald Roth was appointed to the commission for a four-year term. Mr. Roth is a founder and managing partner of the Emerging Markets Partnership, a private equity firm. Before establishing this firm, he worked as an international investment banker in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong and New York, and also served as treasurer of the World Bank for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Mr. Daniel Tully was appointed to the commission for a three-year term. Mr. Tully served as chairman of the board of Merrill Lynch and Company, Incorporated, from 1993 to 1997 and was chief executive officer from 1992 to 1996. He has served as vice-chairman of the American Stock Exchange and director of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Tully is currently on the board of the Elan Corporation plc and of Merrill Lynch, Capital Markets Bank in Dublin. Dr. Michael Somers was appointed,<i> ex officio</i>, to the commission. Because he is a commissioner by virtue of his position as chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, which is manager of the fund, he is the only member of the commission not to have a designated term of office.</P>

      <P>It would be wrong to describe Dr. Somers as an executive director of the commission. The Act names and appoints the NTMA as the first manager of the pension reserve fund commission for a period up to ten years. It is from this that Dr. Somers' position arises and it therefore would not be technically correct to call him the executive director. He is the representative of the NTMA, the first manager. The other people have non-executive positions. It is not the same as a semi-State company as people are not directors. Rather they are commissioners and are between the Minister for Finance and the board. They are totally independent, as is outlined in the Act, and are not subject to any direction, policy or otherwise, from the Minister for Finance or the Government.</P>

Before finalising proposals for submission to the Government, the Cabinet sub-committee will address a wide range of issues including those relating to which Departments and offices should be included in the new programme as well as issues relating to the locations to which such Departments and offices should be transferred. The Cabinet sub-committee has been considering a number of options as to how best to progress the issue. Conscious of the need to accelerate the process the Cabinet sub-committee has established a small interdepartmental working group whose immediate task it is to focus on a couple of options with a view to assisting the sub-committee in the development of a programme for submission to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The two phase process leading to the issuing of a licence to operate the national lottery was approached with the intention of ensuring that the most fair and reasonable circumstances and opportunities for competitive tendering were created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase 1 began on 29 July 1999 when my Department advertised for suitable applicants to participate in a later separate competitive process for the award of the licence. Three applications were received from the current operator, Autotote Worldwide Services and Rockdean Ltd., a subsidiary of Sisal, a Milan based lottery operator. A selection board from within my Depart<Col N="917" /> ment decided that all three were qualified to be considered for the second phase.</P>
    <P>An evaluation group chaired by my Department at second secretary level and comprising four other senior officials was established for phase 2, the actual selection process itself. Mr. Sean Cromien, former Secretary General of my Department, was appointed as process auditor to ensure that the process is implemented in an open and transparent manner. The evaluation group recruited a firm of consultants to advise and assist with the design of the invitation to apply, evaluation of proposals received and the final selection of the successful applicant. The three applicants were issued with a draft invitation to apply and a draft licence on 26 September last. They were subsequently asked to an applicants' conference on 27 October which afforded them the opportunity to query the documents and to raise various issues concerning the future operation of the lottery.</P>
    <P>My Department issued a final invitation to apply to the three applicants on 15 December last, setting the date for final responses at 28 February 2001. Two of the three applicants have since withdrawn from the process leaving An Post National Lottery Company as the sole bidder whose application was received on 28 February and is currently being evaluated. The consultants are conducting a detailed evaluation of the application and supporting documentation. I am advised by the evaluation group that they hope to be in a position to report to me by the end of May or beginning of June, by which time I shall be able to make a decision on the matter. In the meantime, the existing licence has been extended to 1 October 2001 to allow the process to be completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that notwithstanding the process and the fairness and transparency of it heretofore, the current situation is not satisfactory where effectively there is no competition for the operation of the licence? Can he state in so far as he is aware what led the two companies which were interested before New Year to withdraw from the process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what led them to withdraw, but in the light of events in recent years in a wide variety of areas the appropriate procedure was to have an open tender competition. That is why I pursued that route. It is not unusual to go to tender &ndash; lottery bids are very common abroad. We felt we needed to see what was on offer. The initial process resulted in three potential bidders who wanted to apply for the licence. I have explained what happened subsequently and that two have withdrawn leaving An Post National Lottery Company as the only bidder in the race. Since we began the process advice was taken that we should complete it and that is being done. It is hoped the process will have been completed within the next month when I will make my final decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was set out in the draft invitation to apply and the draft licence dated 26 September 2000 which was issued to all these companies and was a monstrous tome. To complete the process is currently costing a considerable amount of money for the one invitee still in the race, namely, An Post. It was a very large tome prepared by consultants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation setting up the national lottery provided that the operating company could spend up to 20% of the total costs on administration and so on. Is the Minister concerned that the company managed to expand its expenditure to up to 20% each time? The expenditure for the initial year was not that heavy but the company seemed to expand the amount it would spend when it realised it could spend up to 20%. Is he concerned about that aspect and has he carried out a thorough investigation of the actual expenditure by the company? </P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The invitation to apply set out very stringent rules on how the company should operate in the future. I was satisfied with the process. I would like to have seen everyone compete to the end game but the two other applicants decided to withdraw at a very late stage having, I suspect, committed a lot of money up to that point. Each invitee had to obtain a lot of legal, accountancy and other professional advice, which would have cost a large fee. However, they decided to withdraw from the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 19 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Euro notes and coins will be introduced into circulation on 1 January 2002. The European Central Bank, which has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of bank notes, has ruled out the making available of euro notes to the public in advance of 1 January.</P>
      <P>As regards coins, ECOFIN has agreed that euro coins can be made available to the public in the second half of December. I announced last month that starter packs of euro coins will go on sale to the public from Monday, 17 December 2001. The packs will be sold at face value, £5 &ndash; 6.35 &ndash; and will contain at least one of each of the eight euro coin denominations. The balance will be made up mainly with the larger-value coins. The packs will be on sale mainly through post offices. Limited supplies will be available at individual banks and building societies and, where feasible, at credit unions for members. The coins will not be legal tender until 1 January 2002 and should not be used before that date.</P>
      <P>As regards preparations for the changeover, these essentially involve six elements, legislation, the production of euro cash, preparations by the public sector, preparations by the private sector, consumer matters and the provision of public information. Substantial progress has been made to date under each of these headings. As regards legislation, the House will be aware that this year's Finance Act and Social Welfare Act provided for the replacement of Irish pound amounts in the tax and social welfare codes with convenient amounts in euro from 1 January 2002. The Euro Changeover (Amounts) Bill currently before the House is aimed, essentially, at dealing with places elsewhere in law where convenient amounts are necessary.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Central Bank that cash production is on target. It will involve 250 million euro notes and over one billion euro coins. Departments continue to confirm that progress on implementation of their changeover plans is on target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards business preparations, the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign has, since its establishment in 1996, distributed very large quantities of information to Irish businesses to help them prepare for the changeover. The Forfás Loughrea euro town project, under the aegis of <Col N="920" /> the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, provided excellent case studies of the practical experience of businesses making changeover preparations. Notwithstanding the extensive work done by the Forfás campaign, however, it is clear that many businesses have yet to engage seriously with their changeover preparations. The message for these businesses is clear &ndash; prepare now.</P>
    <P>The consumer aspects of the changeover are being addressed by the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, and by the Director of Consumer Affairs. They relaunched the national code of practice on the euro changeover last December, with an action plan for consumer protection during the changeover. A key aspect of the code is that subscribers to it, and to any sectoral code approved under it, commit themselves to carry out the changeover fairly and to seek no advantage from the conversion. The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has been carrying out very extensive public information activities since its establishment. Among many other items, the board has sent a leaflet about the euro to every household every year since 1998 and is doing so again this year; has organised widespread circulation of posters, booklets and other information materials, including educational material for schools and materials for every teacher; has run several advertising campaigns on television and radio and in the press; has set up a lo-call helpline and a website, the latter with a special section for schools; has made a train-the-trainers pack widely available for general use; has run a programme of part-funding for non-governmental organisations carrying out euro information activities since 1998; and has catered for low-awareness and special needs groups through its consultative panel.</P>
    <P>Public information activities will, of course, intensify greatly in the autumn. The European Central Bank will be unveiling the security features of the euro notes at the end of August, and they and the appearance of the notes will be widely advertised from then on. The Euro Changeover Board will be increasing its advertising campaign substantially from September onwards and will also be distributing a booklet on the changeover to every household. Extensive dual display of prices will begin from 1 October, the latest date for its introduction under the national and approved sectoral codes. As I have said, starter packs of euro coins will be put on sale from 17 December. There will be a great deal of activity aimed at making sure that the public is ready for the changeover when it begins on 1 January 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, despite the efforts of the changeover board, there is a considerable danger of confusion at the end of the year and the early part of next year? Will he agree that, arising from the confusion, there is a danger of profiteering by unscrupulous people taking advantage of this? Will he accept there is <Col N="921" /> at least a case for making available euro bank notes, perhaps on an optional basis, for Christmas shopping so that people can get used to the notes without having to use them and that that trial period might be helpful from the point of view of trying to get over the confusion? I note that some of his European colleagues have made suggestions to that effect. What steps, if any, have been taken to try to ensure there will not be profiteering as a consequence of confusion following the changeover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there will be a certain level of confusion from 1 January. The whole focus of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland's awareness campaign and so on is to lesson whatever confusion might occur. The same will happen in other countries.</P>
      <P>On profiteering, this is a matter primarily for the Director of Consumer Affairs. I am sure the Deputy is referring to what is believed to have happened following the changeover to decimalisation. There will be scope on this occasion for people to take advantage of the changeover, given that rounding up and so on will have to take place. That will be a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs and I hope people will be wide awake and not get caught out. As I pointed out in my reply, sectoral codes of conduct have been signed up to by various groups and the Euro Changeover Bill bases all changes on the principle of favouring the citizen.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's last question, which is interesting, has come up at the ECOFIN Council meeting. We made a decision that euro coins can be made available from late December. I recently announced that as and from 17 December £5 starter packs will be made available. Originally the ECOFIN Council and the Governor of the Central Bank said that this should not be the case, that 1 January should be the date used. The European Central Bank held out firmly against having notes in circulation before 1 January. The legal position is that notes and coins will not be legal tender until 1 January. My view is that we should stick rigidly to 1 January in relation to notes. One of my colleagues in the ECOFIN Council has been advocating a change of view on it and will probably continue to push the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us at what point will the Central Bank make euro notes and coins available to the commercial banks, and when will they be made available to retailers and the business sector? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank is already involved in negotiations in that regard. Retailers and banks obviously have a key role in the changeover process, during which people will hand in their Irish pounds and get their change in euros. This will take place during the six week period from 1 January to 9 February 2002. The banks will supply coins and notes to their customers and the details of those arrangements are as I <Col N="922" /> described in my speech last week on the Second Stage of the Euro Changeover (Amounts) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect that to happen? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major logistical exercise. There will be a period of intensive activity in the last two weeks of December. In an Irish context, 1 January is probably the least suitable date, having regard to our customary extended Christmas holiday period, somewhat unlike other European countries, and the enormous circulation of cash which is generated by the January sales in the shops. However, the EU concensus was for 1 January 2002. As well as other considerations, the operation will involve major security headaches, both in relation to distribution of the new currency and getting the old notes and coins back to the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Euro Changeover Board to provide any assistance to retailers? Is there a software package which facilitates the conversion process at tills, cash points and computers during a transition period of two or three months ? </P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9, 14, 25, 26, 35, 36, 37, 39, 44, 45, 64, 65 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of preliminary and background work has been done in my Department in relation to a new programme of decentralisation. More recently, the cabinet sub-committee met formally for the first time to begin its consideration of the many and various issues involved. This meeting does not reflect the extent to which the issue has been considered by the Government over the past year or so. I have regularly briefed the Government on various developments and have maintained ongoing informal contacts with my Government colleagues.</P>
      <P>The cabinet sub-committee has also established a small interdepartmental working group to assist its work and to focus on a couple of options which the sub-committee wish to explore further with a view to progressing the subject. I expect that, following the completion of the cabinet sub-committee's work, the Government will be in a position to take decisions regarding a new programme within the next couple of months. In the meantime I emphasise that decisions have not been taken on any aspect of decentralisation, including that as to which Departments or offices will be part of a new programme.</P>
      <P>In developing a new programme the Government will have regard to a wide range of issues and considerations, among them the large number of submissions and representations received in my Department. I am very conscious of the many well made cases for the inclusion of various regions and towns in any new programme, including those made on behalf of the Border region in general, and County Cavan and the Inishowen area in particular, as well the joint application made on behalf of Kilrush, County Clare, Listowel, County Kerry and Newcastle West, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I am confident that any new programme will attract considerable interest among Dublin based civil servants. While it will be impossible to assess the precise level of interest until details of the programme emerge, the level of inquiries from individuals as well as the numbers of staff on the central transfer lists, illustrate the interest among staff in transferring from Dublin to various provincial centres. This is supported by the numbers of staff who participated in the earlier programme of decentralisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed and positive reply. Would he agree that areas such as County Cavan, which have suffered from peripherality due to the division of our country, needs decentralisation in order to benefit from regional development? In view of the <Col N="925" /> great political and economic progress achieved here in recent years, particularly with the cessation of violence in the North of Ireland, would the Minister agree that areas like County Cavan, which suffered huge economic hardship due to the troubles north of the Border, should be given preferential treatment in deciding on locations for decentralisation? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly recognise the impact of the troubles over the past 30 years on counties along the border, including particularly County Cavan which suffered enormously. It is a tribute to the people of those counties that any kind of economic activity has been maintained during those years. I recognise the peripheral argument, which will form the basis of our deliberations. I realise also that many parts of the country have not benefited to the same extent as other parts in the celtic tiger development. That will also form part of our deliberations.</P>
      <P>I should point out that decentralisation is not the only answer to the problems of a region, but I appreciate that it would give a clear signal that the Government is serious about better and more balanced regional development. As Deputies will be aware, my views on this matter could be summed up as follows. Much of the decision making of Departments and Government agencies would be far different if the Department or agency concerned was based in a town in, say, the west, north-west or Border region. Instead of planning the road from Dublin to, for example, Blacklion, County Cavan, the focus would be on how to get the road from Blacklion to Dublin &ndash; and there is a significant difference.</P>
      <P>As I said already during Priority Questions, many criteria must be evaluated and many considerations must be taken on board, including the views of trade union representatives and staff associations and other issues such as the availability of infrastructure in the areas concerned. All of those aspects will be included in our deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Each Deputy usually beats the drum for his own area. I will not let down my own side in that regard. The Minister will be aware of the excellent case made by Bandon, quite apart from which any Department would be lucky to be based there. Does the Minister accept that the facilities available in a place like Bandon should be a consideration in any decision? The second part of my question relates to staffing. I agree that staff cannot be moved around like animals and their views must be taken into account. Am I correct in thinking that there is a huge interest on the part of Dublin based staff in moving out of Dublin? At the time the Department of Agriculture moved to Wexford the numbers of those interested in moving were larger than the actual vacancies available. Is that the general attitude to decentralisation of staff based in Dublin? </P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly recognise the benefits of the town of Bandon. It is one of the parts of west Cork I have visited more often than other areas and I notice that it has become a popular location for people who now commute from Bandon to Cork city. The same thing is happening in my own county. I do not wish to insult trade union representatives but I can see why trade union leaders might want to have a package type approach with all the members in one area. I am not sure that the people they represent feel the same way.</P>
      <P>Senior civil servants in my Department and others have been amazed at the level of interest there is among middle ranking civil servants in decentralisation. A lot of people want to get away from the problems of living in the Dublin area. Another advantage to decentralisation would be recruitment. The Civil Service and bodies have had difficulty recruiting people due to the strength of the labour market but agencies outside the city do not seem to have the same difficulty. Many civil servants want the opportunity to move to better parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister talk about the Blacklion to Dublin concept and I hope he remembers the N2/A5 Donegal to Dublin concept as well. I was going to ask the Minister to confirm that 10,000 people were to be decentralised according to the original announcement but the question seems to have been answered. Does the Minister agree that decentralisation has worked very well in Letterkenny and that the expansion of a cluster to Buncrana is a natural extension of the first decentralisation scheme initiated? Does he agree that Inishowen, an historically isolated location even worse than that of County Cavan and which has lost textile factory after textile factory, deserves the confidence boost that a decentralised office would give? I ask this not to elicit sympathy but because it makes sense and offers a win-win situation to the peninsula and Civil Service alike. Will the Minister confirm the timescale for the making of a decision? He mentioned two months. Is that when a decision will be taken? Will a decision on decentralisation be taken this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped this decision would have been made a long time ago but it has not been possible. I announced earlier in reply to a priority question that I hope to have a decision made on this in the next couple of months. It is still the goal to decentralise up to 10,000 persons from Dublin. That has been my goal from day one. If I do not set the bar high enough I will not get anywhere near it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney makes a very good case for Donegal and particularly Inishowen and refers to the success of decentralisation to Letterkenny. I have learned in debate on the issue recently that Government offices, such as social welfare and revenue, which have already decentralised are the most progressive of the Departments in looking <Col N="927" /> at going somewhere else. They are used to the idea, have got over the problems, have seen it is not the end of the world and that the Department has not fallen asunder. We have learned from them that those used to the idea do not see it as a big deal and they are willing to think in a more lateral way than other Government Departments. I recognise the uniqueness of Inishowen. It is isolated even in County Donegal and certainly isolated from the rest of the country. The difficulties of that region will be in my mind.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recognise the composite proposal from Kilrush, Newcastle West and Listowel. I remind him that all of those locations are outside the BMW region and as such have reduced incentives for industrial development. The Minister should be cognisant of that when it comes to decentralisation. I would like the Minister to consider this proposal put forward on a very professional basis and launched recently by Deputy Kenneally. When did the Minister first announce his policy of decentralisation and does he expect it to be achieved during the lifetime of this Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, it was December 1999. It was budget 2000, delivered in 1999 and in my earlier reply in Priority Questions I would have made the same mistake. I thank Deputy Mc Dowell. I recognised in my reply the joint application made on behalf of Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastle West. I compliment the well presented application. I acknowledged it to Deputy Finucane previously. His colleague, Deputy Collins, has mentioned it as well and Deputy Daly in Clare has been consistently pushing me about Kilrush. At every sporting event we attend Deputy Deenihan tells me the great advantages of Listowel in County Kerry. It is my intention to try to deal with this matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has recognised this proposal from the three towns involved as creative and innovative. I remind him that in recent years there has been a loss of employment in all of these towns and the IDA is finding it increasingly difficult to get industry to locate in them. Does the Minister agree that the only way of providing jobs and restoring and supporting the economy of these towns is through decentralisation? Does he also agree that the possibility of staff movement and promotion is better facilitated if the three centres are near each other as in this case? Proximity will allow easy <Col N="928" /> movement of personnel from one town to the other. The attraction is that a family would not have to move but could commute easily between the three towns. I urge the Minister to take these factors into consideration. The economy of west Limerick, north Kerry and west Clare is very dependent on this decentralisation process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The points put forward by Deputy Deenihan have been well made by him. Some of the Government Departments that have already decentralised will now say they should sub-decentralise. They maintain it would be safer because the offices they occupy are overburdened and they should move out further. That shows some of the advantages of making the decision many years ago. I hope that will apply in some smaller locations around the country.</P>
      <P>I recognise the well made case made by Listowel, Kilrush and Newcastle West. There is an advantage to having a cluster approach. It is difficult to ask civil servants looking at a career structure to pull out in a little group and move to a particular location in the country because then they would not have the same career opportunities as their <i>confrères</i> in Dublin with their progressive promotional structure. In rural Ireland a distance of 20 or 30 miles between towns is not a lot. It takes me well over an hour to travel the 22 miles to Dublin but travel between rural towns would not have the same constraints. The cluster approach has the advantage of offering a promotional channel for civil servants. All these matters are taken into account. I cannot please every Deputy and Senator.</P>

I am appalled at the lack of roads proposed for the north-west in the national development plan in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and links to Derry. Those regions' economic development must be a priority. The lack of road proposals should be made up by decentralisation. West Clare, north Kerry and west Limerick also have good cases. Does the Minister accept that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister stated, echoing what is said by civil servants who participated in decentralisation, that a process which cuts people off from promotion will not succeed. There must be a critical mass in a cluster. A site is available beside the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development office in Cavan that could be used to extend that office and provide accommodation for a further 150 civil servants. That would facilitate the Minister in accelerating the decentralisation programme.</P>

In an earlier reply, I said that if Government agencies were in the parts of the country being considered there would be a different focus. It is hard to break it down. I do my best but extraordinary actions must be taken to make people think differently. People think that things must continue to happen in Dublin. If my Department was in Tullamore, and, as Minister for Finance, I had to go there on a Monday morning, I would think differently.

      <P>The high level gender equality management group, chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily, Revenue Commissioner, produced three separate documents relating to revised policy and procedures for addressing gender equality in the Civil Service, first, a new gender equality policy for the Civil Service; second, a guide for Government Departments on affirmative action, Making it Happen; and third, an outline of mechanisms for the allocation of responsibility, accountability and monitoring in respect of gender equality.</P>
      <P>In June 2000, the Government approved the new gender equality policy in principle and directed that consultations with the staff unions on the implementation of the new policy should begin. Also, the Taoiseach announced that the Government had set a target of one third of posts at assistant principal level to be filled by women within five years. A final draft of the text is currently being considered by the staff unions. These consultations will be concluded shortly, allowing the policy to be formally approved under the conciliation and arbitration scheme, before final consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>I hope that the new gender equality policy will be announced in the summer. In anticipation of it, Departments are asked to adopt increasingly specific strategic objectives and equality goals, to be published as part of each Department's strategy statement, with a view to achieving the one third target at assistant principal level over the next five years, and to increasing the representation of women at all grades above that of assistant principal during the same period.</P>
      <P>Research on gender imbalance in the Civil Service at HEO level and above, commissioned as part of the SMI process and published in 1999, showed that women were under-represented at senior management levels in the Civil Service and that progress towards a better balance of men and women in those grades had been minimal from 1987 to 1997. The report identified the under-representation of women in the assistant principal grade as a particular obstacle to the advancement of women to senior management levels within the Civil Service. The main research findings, together with a package of measures based on the recommendations in the report, were endorsed by the Government and were presented by the Taoiseach and myself at the launch of the current phase of the Strategic Management Initiative for the Civil Service in July 1999. A key element of these measures was the development and adoption of a new gender equality policy.</P>

      <P>The informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council took place on 20-22 April 2001 in Malmo, Sweden. Informal meetings of the Council provide Ministers with an opportunity to engage in a general discussion on issues which will feature on the agenda of future formal Councils. It is not the practice for such meetings to have a formal agenda or to arrive at formal decisions. The informal ECOFIN began on Friday, 20 April with a meeting to discuss future tax policies and ECOFIN involvement in enlargement. The discussion on future taxation policies covered both direct and indirect taxation, while the debate on ECOFIN involvement in enlargement looked at ways in which Finance Ministers can contribute to the process. This first session was followed by a Eurogroup meeting, which looked at the economic situation and policy mix, preparation for the G7, and the euro notes and coins changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Saturday, 21 April, the informal ECOFIN reconvened. Ministers were joined by central bank governors to discuss the current global economic situation and prospects. There was also an exchange of views on financial services and the Brouwer report on financial crisis management. <Col N="932" /> Also, consideration was given to the question of how best to formulate and advance EU interests at the IMF. The speech to be made by the Presidency on behalf of the EU at the upcoming meeting of the IMF International Monetary and Finance Committee was also approved.</P>
    <P>Over lunch, the Belgian Presidency of the Eurogroup gave a debriefing on proceedings at the Eurogroup meeting of the previous evening. Discussion continued over lunch on current international economic and financial issues. Having reviewed recent economic and financial developments in Turkey, Ministers reiterated their support for the efforts of the Turkish Government to implement a strong national economic programme. They also called on the IMF and the World Bank to provide additional assistance in this context as well as stressing the need for continued support from the private sector.</P>
    <P>After lunch, ECOFIN Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the European Union met with their counterparts from the enlargement candidate countries, together with representatives of the Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Discussion covered a range of issues relating to macroeconomic and financial stability, both in the EU and in the candidate countries. This meeting marked the beginning of an intensified economic policy dialogue between the EU and the candidate countries.</P>

      <P>There is a later question on this matter but I will answer the Deputy. The broad economic policy guidelines for 2001 will be finalised at the heads of state meeting in June. Prior to that, there will be an ECOFIN Council on the first Monday and Tuesday in June which will finalise our submission on the BEPGs. That will go forward to the heads of state who will have the final say. The process started some months ago and the first draft, which was in the newspapers, was issued. It goes to an alternates meeting of the EFC and will go back and forth. All countries are requesting some changes, as is normal, and that process has been ongoing.</P>

      <P>This advertising campaign aims to ensure that the public is made aware that the Government will not be underwriting these accounts and that they are offered by financial institutions. Individual financial institutions are advertising the attractiveness of their various products. The primary purpose of the advertising campaign in which I have a small role is to ensure the Government is not seen as underwriting these products. I said at the time I introduced this initiative that I hoped there would be a major take up. I said the market would offer great products, and it has done so. The greater the take up, the greater the cost to the Exchequer, but encouraging people to save on a regular monthly basis is very worthwhile.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recent Central Statistics Office data on incomes, I call on the Government and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to give priority to investment, job creation, replacement industry, the building of advance factories, infrastructure and the decentralisation of Departments to south Tipperary. The Central Statistics Office data show that the south-east region, of which south Tipperary is part, has the lowest incomes in the country &ndash; a full 12% below the national average or 88% of the national average. Those figures are worse than the figures in the Border, midland and western region, but despite this the area does not qualify for any special EU assistance which is available to the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>South Tipperary has again fallen further behind in the country's prosperity league. It was seventh from the bottom of the league in the last set of statistics from the Central Statistics Office but it is now fifth from the bottom. The gap in terms of income per head compared, for example, <Col N="935" /> to our colleagues in north Tipperary continues to widen. People in north Tipperary have a much higher disposable income than those in south Tipperary. The Border, midland and western region has incomes 10% higher than the south-east region and south Tipperary. In Dublin, incomes are a full 40% higher than in south Tipperary.</P>
    <P>These figures are particularly worrying in view of earlier data from the small area research unit in Trinity College, Dublin, which showed that 49% or almost 37,000 people in south Tipperary live in areas of material deprivation. The towns of Carrick-on-Suir in east Tipperary and Tipperary town in west Tipperary are two examples. In both those towns, there are two district electoral divisions. In both towns, there is maximum deprivation in one of the DEDs and second to maximum deprivation in the other DED. It means there is 12% unemployment in both those towns &ndash; three to four times the national average. The Taoiseach came to south Tipperary last June and told us employment had been dealt with. Thankfully, he was in Tipperary town a fortnight ago and he has now accepted that 12% unemployment is correct for Tipperary town, and that is also the situation in Carrick-on-Suir. In those two towns, there has been devastation by way of closures with little or no replacement industries for those areas.</P>
    <P>There is considerable migration from both those towns. Some 94% of young people leave the towns for third level education and employment and only about 6% stay or come back to those towns. In the case of Tipperary town, 1,500 leave the town every day to go to work elsewhere. The population of west Tipperary and Tipperary town has fallen by about 8% over the last two censuses, although there has been a 2.8% increase in population nationally.</P>
    <P>I am also very worried by the recent publication of national spatial strategies by Fine Gael and the Labour Party which earmarked Kilkenny as the secondary employment growth centre in the south-east. If this were implemented, it would further disadvantage towns in south Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to prioritise south Tipperary in relation to the building of advance factories and decentralisation. Tipperary is the only county in Munster without decentralisation. We are entitled to 700 jobs under the decentralisation programme. The Minister should announce such a programme for south Tipperary immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of jobs is a matter for the industrial development agencies, and not one in which the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment would have a direct function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, through the enterprise development agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. A key factor in the <Col N="936" /> achievement of this objective, and a primary objective of this Government, is the creation of a business environment in which job opportunities continue to flourish and, equally, in which job applicants have the requisite skills requirements. In line with commitments contained in the national development plan, the enterprise development agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. The new 12.5% corporation tax rate, which many Deputies criticised, and initiatives on matters such as education, physical infrastructure and technology under the national development plan, allow Ireland to remain competitive both in developing indigenous industry and securing inward investment projects. We have a track record in that field which is second to none; we are ahead of all of our competitors in Europe.</P>
    <P>The achievement of balanced regional development is a key policy and operational objective of the Department and of the industrial development agencies. It is enshrined in industrial development legislation, and is a key objective in the policy statements of the Department and of the development agencies. Progress on the achievement of targets set in respect of regional development is monitored and reported on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>Balanced regional development requires a better spread of investment, employment and population growth between regions and within regions, and not just in the urban centres. The Department and the development agencies seek to ensure that the required investments in economic and social infrastructure to achieve more balanced regional development are identified and put in place. The co-ordination of policy is continuously pursued and achieved through a number of mechanisms between the Department, Forfás and the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. The implementation of this co-ordinated policy approach is monitored annually through the approval of the negotiating guidelines of the agencies, which have a strong regional focus, by the Department and the board of Forfás.</P>
    <P>In an effort to ensure that the objective of balanced regional development will be achieved, IDA Ireland recently re-organised its internal structures. This restructuring included the allocation of additional staff to its regional offices, the opening of new regional offices and allocating regional responsibilities to key executives in its HQ project divisions. IDA Ireland's strategy for the south-east region is focused on achieving a better regional distribution of new overseas projects away from their preferred locations.</P>
    <P>In Tipperary South, IDA Ireland is pursuing the targets arising from the Seagate task force, which the Minister established following the announcement of the closure of Seagate. The top priority was to find a replacement industry for Seagate, which has been achieved with the <Col N="937" /> location of the Guidant Corporation in Clonmel. This corporation plans to create over 1,100 jobs and is actively recruiting in the south-east region.</P>
    <P>The second priority was to proceed with an advance factory in Cashel. This was completed and on 1 February last, IDA announced that Alza Corporation has decided to locate a $50 million pharmaceutical project in the factory. This project is expected to create approximately 100 new jobs over time.</P>
    <P>The third priority set for IDA Ireland by the task force was to provide an advance factory in Tipperary town as a &ldquo;follow on&rdquo; to the letting of the Cashel facility. Securing the Alza project for the Cashel facility will allow IDA Ireland to progress its commitment to provide an advance factory in Tipperary town. I understand that IDA Ireland has advised Carrick-on-Suir UDC that it is prepared to give serious consideration to providing an advance factory in the town once a client is secured for the proposed facility in Tipperary town. In addition, IDA Ireland is also working closely with the existing overseas companies in the county to encourage further expansion. These include Guidant Corporation, Pall Corporation, Continental Promotions, Merck Sharpe and Dohme and SRAM. The agency is also involved in actively promoting the 24,000 sq. ft. former Bomont Plastics facility in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
    <P>With regard to the indigenous sector, provisional data from the Forfás employment survey shows that in indigenous companies overall employment has increased by a net 6,300 to 146,000 in 2000. Enterprise Ireland, which works with indigenous industry, is mindful of the need to encourage its client companies to focus on maintaining competitiveness in an increasingly global economy, and against the background of perceived threats to the more traditional sectors of industry from low cost economies. The emphasis of Enterprise Ireland's financial interventions has changed from capacity building to capability building supports.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Healy as a new Deputy that no Government has done more for his county, for his constituency or for the country. The record of investment, the opportunities created, the plans we have put together, the incentives that are in position ensure that the future is assured and that the people of south Tipperary will benefit both from the natural environment and the investment the Government is making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Accessible transport is still a myth for many physically disabled people in Ireland. I want to outline to the House why I believe this to be the case. Last week, reports of people with a physical disability being transported, against all health and safety guidelines, in the engine room of Iarnród Éireann trains made the headlines. The subsequent controversy, and <Col N="938" /> earlier reports in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i> and other media, indicate that this was not an isolated incident.</P>
      <P>Over the May bank holiday weekend, two wheelchair users on a shopping trip to a south Dublin shopping centre spent three hours unsuccessfully calling ten taxi companies in order to return home. They were forced to go to the local fire station from where they were transported home in an ambulance, yet there are over 1,000 wheelchair accessible taxis operating in Dublin. Where are those taxis? What is happening? Can the Minister explain this? This has happened despite the setting up of a Commission on Disability, the enactment of an Equal Status Act, changes in the taxi industry. Two people had to spend three hours calling ten taxi companies in an effort to get home.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus recently placed advertisements entitled &ldquo;Transport for All&rdquo; in the national newspapers to highlight the introduction of new accessible buses. Only 10% of the Dublin Bus fleet is accessible to people with a physical disability. Perhaps the advertisements should have been entitled &ldquo;Transport for All, if you happen to live along certain bus routes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Department has recently issued licences to private bus operators, for example, Aircoach at Dublin Airport, without conditions requiring that vehicles be accessible. The Government, through its inaction in the area of promoting equal rights to accessible transport for all citizens, is colluding in excluding a large number of people from travelling and thus excluding them from participating in their local community, never mind accessing employment. We already have an 80% unemployment rate among the disabled.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Government is in breach of the Equal Status Act, 2000, in denying people with a physical disability the right to a transport service? Will the Minister agree that calling something accessible does not of itself make it accessible? What is the point of having accessible taxis, buses, rail carriages, albeit a limited number, if they are accessible in name only? What does the Minister intend to do to ensure that the rights of people with physical disability to accessible transport are vindicated and protected? Is it not time the Government enforced its own legislation? Why has the Minister not yet met any of the representative groupings of disabled people who have been seeking such a meeting since December last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be aware of the distress felt by disabled people who are increasingly unable to access taxis as the drivers with accessible taxis plates, issued prior to deregulation, are opting to sell their accessible cars in order to operate saloon cars which do not involve the same financial costs. Five months have passed since deregulation of the taxi industry, but the strategy around accessible taxis has led to a decrease in the numbers, according to reports from people trying to access them. No resources have been made available to local authorities to <Col N="939" /> allow drivers to undergo training in the operation of ramps as recommended by different groupings and as suggested within the Taxi Forum.</P>
    <P>There are no mechanisms or resources available to sanction drivers who blatantly refuse to offer their service to disabled customers, particularly at taxi ranks. All of this contradicts the intent of the Equal Status Act introduced only a month prior to the Minister's deregulation, a reality reinforced on the announcement of the measures not requiring all taxis in respect of which new plates are issued to be accessible.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State's comments on this serious human rights issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the Minister for Public Enterprise that all transport operators, and in particular the State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility to disabled or mobility impaired people within the overall resources available to them. Policy in relation to wheelchair accessible taxis is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, while overall policy in relation to people with disabilities is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 contains a number of significant provisions in relation to the accessibility of public transport for disabled and mobility impaired people. All new and upgraded rail and bus stations financed under the plan will be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people; all light rail vehicles, including Luas and suburban railcars financed under the plan, will also be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people; and all buses purchased by CIE from 2000 for use on urban services will be low floor.</P>
      <P>Both the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness gave commitments to the establishment of a public transport accessibility committee. That committee was inaugurated by the Minister for Public Enterprise on 11 July 2000. The committee is composed of representatives of a number of organisations representing the disabled, the elderly, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and the Light Rail Project Office. The committee is advising the Minister on the accessibility aspects of proposed public transport investments, on accessibility issues relating to existing public transport facilities and services, and, where appropriate, will make recommendations for prioritised cost effective measures to address these issues.</P>
      <P>The NDP also includes a special provision of £10 million to part-finance accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities. The committee will advise the Minister with regard to particular projects which could be funded from this allocation. The three CIE operating companies have already made significant progress in relation to accessibility matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> Bus Átha Cliath has established a three-person bus group headed by the business development manager to deal with accessibility issues. A people with disability consultative group has also been established which includes representatives of a broad range of accessibility interests. The company also runs disability awareness training courses for bus drivers.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath has commenced the introduction of several new wheelchair accessible buses. The scale of this programme is such that the company is able to completely convert a number of routes to accessibility standard as the buses are delivered. Some 250 low floor buses are now in operation in Dublin. A fleet plan has been developed to 2006. In summary, a total of 750 additional buses will be brought into the fleet over this period and all of these vehicles will be fully accessible. Accessible buses will then constitute about 60% of the total fleet.</P>
    <P>In 1998 Bus Éireann established a consultative group for people with disabilities representing a range of disability organisations and has assigned responsibility for accessibility matters to a senior manager. It is the company's policy to procure, wherever possible, improved-access vehicles as part of the ongoing fleet replacement programme. In addition, and in line with the provisions of the NDP, all new station facilities and the refurbishment of existing ones will take into account the needs of the mobility impaired. Bus Éireann operates city services in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. In line with the provisions of the NDP it is now company policy to purchase only low floor wheelchair accessible buses for city services and it is planned that by the end of this year the company will have fully accessible bus fleets in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Up to now low floor buses have been acquired exclusively for urban services. However, Bus Éireann has acquired 20 low floor wheelchair accessible buses for use on a trial basis on rural services. These buses are currently being tested on a number of rural routes throughout the country and their performance will be evaluated, particularly in relation to their operation in rural locations over difficult operating terrain and conditions. The results of the trials will then be used as a basis for determining future purchases.</P>
    <P>The needs of mobility-impaired people are also considered when specifying coach type vehicles for Expressway and longer distance commuter routes. However, customer demand in this highly competitive section of the travel market is for luxury specification coaches with a high level seating position and under floor luggage space. This prohibits a low floor construction and the customer preference is reflected in the specification of coaches available from the manufacturers. This causes accessibility problems for people with serious mobility impairments and unfortunately precludes wheelchair access.</P>
    <P>In an effort to ease the situation, all new coaches purchased by Bus Éireann since 1990 <Col N="941" /> have been specified with a &ldquo;kneeling&rdquo; facility whereby the front of the coach can be lowered to provide easier access to the first internal step. High visibility nosing on steps, adequate handrails, high quality lighting and heating and public address systems are also specified for Bus Éireann's coaches in order to make them more accessible.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann is continuing to monitor developments in relation to coach design and manufacture which would improve its capability to meet the needs of people with mobility impairments in a realistic, safe, practical and cost effective manner. In that regard, a trial involving three double-decker coaches, which have a low floor and a wheelchair space on the lower deck, is currently under way between Dublin and Ashbourne, County Meath.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has established a disability users group to advise it on accessibility matters. The group comprises regular rail users all of whom have a mobility impairment. In addition it has appointed a mobility impaired liaison officer whose function it is to co-ordinate the implementation of accessibility policy as well as providing assistance to disabled and mobility impaired passengers.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in adapting our public transport system to the needs of the mobility impaired.</P>

      <P>The city of Dublin and the whole country is rightly outraged by the failure of the Department of Defence to transfer the 13.65 acre site at Clancy Barracks to Dublin Corporation for social and affordable housing for our citizens. As I told the Taoiseach yesterday, every night recently up to 200 homeless citizens have had to sleep rough and a record 7,500 families are on the Dublin Corporation housing lists. I know a number of these unfortunate citizens myself. The explosion of homelessness and our housing lists has been a regrettable feature of the growing inequality in Irish life under the past four years of this Government. For that reason I asked the Taoiseach today urgently to reconsider his decision on Clancy Barracks and to allow time in the House for a discussion of housing strategies around the country.</P>
      <P>The Dublin city and region housing strategy makes sad and alarming reading. We need a minimum of 75,000 housing units until 2005, of which Dublin Corporation's share will be at least 26,000 or an average of 4,300 houses a year. About 2,500 of these units should be social and affordable housing. The current housing list stands at 7,420 families and the four Dublin local authorities together have a current list of 14,831 families, or perhaps 50,000 people, who are living in very overcrowded conditions or who are homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Government house prices have exploded by nearly 150% in the past five years in the Dublin area, where developed housing land is <Col N="942" /> so scarce, and by over 120% in the rest of the country. Rents have also more than doubled and the Government has bluntly refused to regulate rents in any way or to contain the worst excesses of the landlord class, which is made up of perhaps its staunch supporters. The most serious problem of all is the lack of land for affordable housing in the Dublin city area. Only three significant tranches of land remain &ndash; the docklands area, my own northern fringe area, and Pelletstown.</P>
    <P>The bottom line of the Dublin city housing strategy which was amended last Monday night to become the law of the land is that at the end of 2005, even with the Part V provision introduced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, there will be at least 6,500 families on the Dublin housing list, almost the same number as at present.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the release of 13.65 acres of land by the Department of Defence on the edge of the inner city and in a most attractive location close to the Liffey, the railway and surrounded by three major parklands, seemed to offer a very important landbank for perhaps 300 to 500 social or affordable houses, community and local commercial development. The site offered perhaps up to one and half years supply of corporation building land.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation officials and the Departments of Defence and Environment and Local Government are giving very different versions of their negotiations on this matter since 1998. Last Monday at Dublin City Council, where I lead the Labour Party, we were told that the Clancy Barracks site was not offered to Dublin Corporation. That is what I was led to believe. Today the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence asserted that it was offered to the city but at an amazing market cost of £40 million. In effect the homeless of Dublin were going to have to finance the re-equipment and modernisation of our Army, the total cost of which is £50 million. Who is telling the truth? Are the Taoiseach and his Ministers hiding behind erratic and desultory negotiations to shift the blame for this debacle on to the Dublin City Manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, and Assistant City Manager, Mr. Sean Carey?</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are listed buildings on the site and that there were concerns about how much social housing could be accommodated there, yet every Dublin citizen would think that negotiations on such a vital matter for the city should have been brought to an early and successful conclusion with the transfer of the land to the city at a reasonable sum of £5 million to £10 million to provide necessary accommodation. As the leader of the Labour Party's councillors on Dublin City Council, I call on the Lord Mayor, Alderman Maurice Ahern, to call a special meeting of the council to get to the bottom of this matter and find out what input we have had through our city manager and his officials since 1998.</P>
    <P>I realise the matter is being dealt with by auctioneers, but a precedent was set in the case of Devoy Barracks in Naas, which was returned to <Col N="943" /> be used for housing having been on the market. It was withdrawn following an outraged chorus from those in south Kildare. I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, to bring this crazy situation to an end and to allow Clancy Barracks to be used for social and affordable housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent closure of many barracks has freed up important sites in towns, allowing plans for important new community, health, industrial and housing initiatives to progress. Increasing demand for social housing and related programmes and the Government's new decentralisation initiative mean it is quite likely that the freeing up of military locations for alternative uses will be used to assist Government programmes.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to ensure the Defence Forces are adequately equipped to undertake the roles assigned to them. Establishing realistic equipment requirements and priorities for procurement forms a major element of strategic planning activities within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. The objective is to acquire, maintain and manage equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Defence Forces at the appropriate level of operational readiness in a cost effective manner. The strategic focus of the investment programme between 2000 and 2010 is to acquire a broad range of equipment to achieve a balanced increase in operational capacity throughout the Defence Forces. It will be necessary to prioritise and reconcile the equipment requirements for the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force within the total resources available. A multi-annual budgetary strategy, vital to achieving value for money, is central to this plan.</P>
      <P>Clancy Barracks, situated on the south bank of the River Liffey and formerly known as Islandbridge Barracks, dates from about 1857. It was accepted at the time of the decision to dispose of six barracks that the relocation of units currently at Clancy Barracks to other Dublin barracks and the Curragh would take some time. It is anticipated that this process will be complete before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>On 16 July 1998, following the Government decision, Dublin Corporation was requested to change the zoning designation on Clancy Barracks to provide for housing and/or commercial development at this location. On 6 July 1999, Dublin Corporation confirmed the land was zoned Z1 to protect, to provide and improve residential amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 November 1998, Dublin Corporation requested it be given the first opportunity to acquire the property. On 16 June 1999, at a meeting with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and my Department, the corporation sought clarification regarding the date of closure of the barracks, the area involved, and <Col N="944" /> expressed a wish to have the property made available to relieve the housing crisis in the Dublin area. The corporation indicated it would be prepared to pay full market value and requested permission to inspect the barracks, which inspection took place on 1 July 1999. Further visits to the property were undertaken on 17 July and 22 October 1999.</P>
    <P>On 1 November 1999, at a meeting between my Department and Dublin Corporation, the corporation indicated it was anxious to acquire the property for a mixture of affordable and social housing. It was mentioned that the barracks contained a number of listed buildings which would pose architectural problems in matching the old with the new. Further plans outlining internal and external services, including drains and sewerage, were requested and were supplied on 8 December 1999.</P>
    <P>On 8 February 2000, the corporation informed my Department that its planning officer had indicated that a large number of buildings on the site were of architectural merit and might be required to be retained on redevelopment. The corporation notified the Valuation Office of the report from its deputy planning officer. On 24 March 2000, the Valuation Office valued the property at about £40 million. It must be borne in mind, however, that the price to be realised will be determined by the market.</P>
    <P>On 14 April 2000, the corporation was informed of the value of Clancy Barracks and it indicated it would consider the valuation and discuss its implications with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. On 7 July 2000, the Department of the Environment and Local Government indicated it was the corporation's view that the acquisition of the barracks to provide social housing did not offer an attractive proposition because of the limited capacity to provide low rise housing. It was believed that the public interest would be best served from a housing and planning point of view if the Department of Defence offered the property for sale on the open market, having regard to the very significant range of conservation challenges.</P>
    <P>On 10 July 2000 my Department noted the corporation's views and informed it that I intended to dispose of the property on the open market as soon as possible. On 31 July 2000, Dublin Corporation advised my Department that the optimal solution would be for the land to be sold on the open market subject to a brief to be agreed between the Department and the planning authority. The brief could cover key requirements such as an appropriate mix of uses and the requirement to yield 20% social and affordable housing under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>At a meeting on 9 April 2001 this year between the Department of Defence, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the corporation, it was indicated that the site offered more potential for a private developer who could <Col N="945" /> have a mix of developments on the site than for the corporation for social housing.</P>
    <P>I add that the Department did not change its views on the sale of Devoy Barracks in Naas, which was negotiated by the appropriate local authority and me. The barracks was not withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that Dublin Corporation did not agree to purchase Clancy Barracks. As I have said many times, evidence from cases where barrack lands were disposed of will show that the Department of Defence has given 100% priority to community needs. All sites so far have been sold to local authorities, health boards or other State institutions and it was my intention to do the same in the case of Clancy Barracks. Nothing on the record will show that the position was otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the Ballyroan sewerage scheme in County Laois, for which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced funding on 21 May 1999. I seek an explanation as to why tenders have not yet been sought for the construction of this scheme and why this important project has been delayed. The people of Ballyroan have waited over 27 years for this sewerage scheme and the lack of progress has prevented the natural growth and development of the village.</P>
      <P>Ballyroan received good news in 1999 when the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, arrived in County Laois to announce the provision of £500,000 for a badly needed and long overdue sewerage scheme. The Minister went on to say that he was making funding immediately available, which would be distributed by his Department when the local authority was ready to get on with the project. The Minister made it clear that it was Laois County Council's responsibility to deliver the project, but the council has failed the people of Ballyroan. There have been unnecessary delays and the council needs to redeem itself in the eyes of the people of Ballyroan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eight months after the Minister's announcement, consultants appointed by Laois County Council produced plans which were put on public display, as is normal in the planning process. Submissions from the general public were invited. An eight month delay in getting to that stage was totally unacceptable but what happened next was far more extraordinary. At the end of the period for public consultation, the consultants reviewed their own plans, prepared just four months earlier, and concluded that they had located the treatment plant for the sewerage works in the wrong <Col N="946" /> location. They decided it was necessary to draw up new plans and to relocate the treatment works further from the centre of the village.</P>
    <P>As a result of this decision, new plans were put on public display and further submissions were sought. When advertisements appeared in newspapers for a second time, those in the community were totally confused as they thought it was a repeat of a previous advertisement. It was a brand new notice highlighting new details in relation to the sewerage scheme. It was the summer of 2000 before the second set of plans was put on public display and 12 months had passed since the Minister's announcement that funding was to be made available. It was an unacceptable delay and bad for the people of County Laois.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone say that dealing with public authorities to deliver on capital projects takes far more time than dealing with the private sector, it has been proved in County Laois that this is simply not the case. The £50 million midland prison project, seven times the scale of Ballyroan sewerage scheme, has been brought from approval to design and finance within a few years and is now fully operational. A major extension to the hospital in the Portlaoise, costing £25 million, is under construction and it is only a few years since approval was given for drawing up the plans.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on one hand, and the Midland Health Board and the Department of Health and Children, on the other, have been able to proceed quickly with major capital projects in County Laois, but Laois County Council has not been in a position to do likewise. I demand that Laois County Council ensure this job goes to tender without further delay, that it appoint contractors immediately, that work commence on this project this year and that it guarantee a start and completion date for it.</P>
    <P>The political will for this project exists. Funding has been provided at political level. As a new Fianna Fáil Deputy representing Laois-Offaly, I am pleased we have demonstrated the political will and provided the funding for this project. It is up to Laois County Council to deliver the job.</P>
    <P>The latest cost estimate for this project is £800,000 and projects under £1 million do not require to be submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for approval before going to tender. This project is, therefore, clearly in the hands of Laois County Council.</P>
    <P>From Laois's perspective, it is a shame that when funding is made available by the Government at national level for this project we are not able to get our act together at local level to advance it. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response and to work getting under way on this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond <Col N="947" /> to this matter and has asked me to do so on his behalf. I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and for the contribution he has made on it.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, there has been remarkable social and economic growth in Ireland over the past few years and this has been reflected in a corresponding expansion and broadening of the water and sewerage services investment programme. Total planned investment in water and sewerage services over the period of the national development plan is almost £3 billion, of which £2.4 billion is for major public schemes. The Government is focusing on providing water and waste water services required to support economic and social development, employment generation, maintenance of high growth rates and the achievement of high environmental standards.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced last July the first phase of the water services investment programme, covering the years 2000-02, the beginning of a rolling three year programme that will continue up to the end of the national development plan in 2006. Funding is being provided for new projects in every county, with total investment envisaged for Laois under the 2000-02 programme amounting to more than £23 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ballyroan sewerage scheme has been fully approved for funding under the rural towns and villages initiative. This initiative provides support for the development of rural towns and villages and for combating rural depopulation. It targets those rural towns and villages that have not ben<Col N="948" /> efited from EU funding to the same degree as larger towns and cities because of the need to concentrate on meeting EU requirements relating to drinking water and waste water treatment standards.</P>
    <P>The Ballyroan sewerage scheme, estimated to cost £800,000, will provide a new foul sewer network and secondary treatment facilities. The provision of these treatment facilities will ensure that any danger of pollution of the local watercourse is eliminated and that any development potential in the area can be realised.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was approved, and in line with the devolution of responsibility to local authorities for the approval of certain elements of capital water services projects, Laois County Council was advised it could proceed immediately to seek tenders for it. It is not necessary for the council to submit a tender recommendation to the Department for approval unless it proposes to accept other than the lowest bid.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the foregoing it is entirely a matter for Laois County Council to progress this scheme to construction. The money has been provided in the water services programme and the Minister wishes to see the work started as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is important local authorities gear up to ensure services of this kind are provided in areas such as Ballyroan. I welcome Deputy Fleming's initiative to ensuring this work can get under way at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 May 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 23, 124, 129 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's inflation rate as measured by the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, HICP, stood at 4.3% in the year to April 2001 well down from the peak of 6.0% in November 2000. The Netherlands at 5.3% and Portugal at 4.6% had higher April inflation figures than Ireland. The euro zone annual average for April was 2.9% compared to 2.6% for March. The consumer price index, CPI, for April was an annual rate of 5.6% compared with its November 2000 high point of 7.0%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At budget time my Department forecasted an average CPI increase this year of 4.5% which is also the rate forecasted by the Central Bank in its spring bulletin. It is expected that inflation will continue to decline as the year progresses as external factors, such as the rise in oil prices and the fall in the euro, which pushed up the inflation rate last year, pass out of the index. My Depart<Col N="950" /> ment will publish a revised inflation forecast for this year later this summer in the Economic Review and Outlook.</P>
    <P>My Department is closely monitoring the factors affecting the inflation rate. The main influences in the figures for April included increases in the price of alcohol, food and transport. Together these three factors represented 0.68% of the 0.9% increase in the April inflation from March.</P>
    <P>As a small open economy remaining competitive is crucial to us. We must be vigilant in relation to domestic inflationary pressures, in particular. That is why I announced an anti-inflation package of measures at budget time. This package included first, direct taxation measures to increase participation in the economy and thereby ease the labour shortages which contribute to wage pressures; second, cuts in indirect taxes to bring down the inflation rate and ease transportation costs, and third, measures to encourage consumers to save rather than to spend.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 47, 53 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>At budget time, based on the latest available domestic and international data, my Department forecasted that growth, as measured by real GDP, would be of the order of 8.75% for the year 2001 compared to an estimated GDP growth rate of 10.75% for last year. Real GNP growth of 7.4% was forecasted for this year as compared to 8.6% for 2000. The projected level of growth was founded on a strong domestic environment and buoyant export growth. However, the domestic and international economic situation has changed since budget day. The main factors have been the emergence of foot and mouth disease and the US economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of domestic and international commentators have taken on board the possible negative impact of such factors and have revised down their forecasts for Ireland's growth rate for 2001 by up to 2%. For example, the ESRI now predict GDP will grow by 6.75% in real terms. However, regardless of which set of forecasts you choose to look at, Ireland's growth rate for the year 2001 will again be considerably in excess of the average growth rate for the EU as a whole.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it is established practice that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about the tax affairs of an individual or a company, other than when the Deputy asking the question is asking the question on behalf of the taxpayer. In this instance it would appear the Deputy is not asking the question with the consent of the company concerned. In these circumstances, therefore, I regret that I must accept the advice of the Revenue Commissioners that the information sought should not be divulged on grounds of confidentiality.</P>
      <P>By way of general comment which is unrelated to any case, the Deputy may take it that Revenue monitors very closely any perceived abuses of the tax system and take appropriate action in the circumstances. If changes in legislation are deemed necessary the Revenue would normally bring forward recommendations to counter such abuses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, under section 111(6) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, as amended by Statutory Instrument No. 96 of 1998, my consent to the charging of a fee for such licences is required. The question of when the licences are awarded is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that I have received a request for my consent to certain fee proposals from the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and that I met with the director in that regard on 21 February 2001. The licence fees to be charged were not finalised at that meeting. I am awaiting further contact from the director, with a view to finalising this matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In fulfilling my statutory responsibility I will be concerned to ensure that the fees paid adequately reflect the value of the licences issued, taking account of the non-financial obligations involved in the licence terms, and of the importance of third generation mobile telephony to the development of the telecoms infrastructure in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is unclear that a product as is suggested could qualify as a biofuel under excise law. It is also unclear if waste mineral oil or vegetable oils are intended for use in this product. The persons interested in any such scheme should contact the Revenue Commissioners if they need more information.</P>
      <P>Under section 94 of the Finance Act, 1999, &ldquo;biofuel&rdquo; is included in the definition of a substitute fuel, which in turn is included within the definition of mineral oil. Section 95(4) of the Finance Act, 1999 states that substitute fuel used as a propellant shall be subject to mineral oil tax at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC, member states may be authorised to introduce exemptions from the payment of excise duty or to reduce the amount of excise duty payable on mineral oil products for specific policy considerations. Such new derogations under the directive require a proposal from the Commission, which follows on from a comprehensive review of the proposal by the Commission services, and then the unanimous agreement at Council level. In practice the Commission will now propose derogations only for a fixed period of time.</P>

      <P>On April 25, the European Commission published its proposals for the 2001 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. The guidelines cover a number of areas, including fiscal policy, reform of product and capital markets and labour markets. This was essentially the first draft of the 2001 guidelines.</P>
      <P>As in previous years, the final version of the guidelines may be different from the initial Commission proposal and Ireland, like many other member states, will propose some rewording of the Commission's draft guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Commission proposals for the 2001 guidelines are being discussed by officials in a number of EU Committees &ndash; the Economic and Financial Committee and the Economic Policy Committee. They will be discussed by the Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, early in June and then it is expected that they will be submitted to heads of state and government.</P>

      <P>This question refers to a report, Household Incomes, Regions and Counties 1991-1998, published by the CSO earlier this month. In the report household income includes wages and salaries, income from self employment, and transfer payments from the State &ndash; these include the imputed value of some non-cash benefits, which accrue to households such as secondary and university education, free drugs and free fuel and transport for the elderly.</P>
      <P>It also includes, in conformity with the definition of income in the national accounts, the imputed value of own farm consumption and income in kind, as well as the imputed rent of owner occupied dwellings, that is, the estimated rent that the occupier, as a tenant, would pay to him or herself as a landlord. Household income on this national accounting basis is therefore not the same as the cash income that accrues to private households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report states that disposable income <i>per capita</i> of the South East region was 12% below the State average in 1998 and was the lowest of the eight regional authority areas. While no <Col N="955" /> detailed analysis has been carried out by my Department of the underlying reasons for the disparity in <i>per capita</i> disposable income in different regions shown in the report, it appears that among the factors involved are the structure of the population and the nature of economic activities in each region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to amend section 33 of the Finance Act, 1999, as suggested by the Deputy. That section, which applies equally to employees in the civil and public sectors as it does to private sector employees, waives a BIK tax charge on an employee in respect of the expense incurred by the employee's employer in providing the employee with a travel pass. For the exemption to apply, the employer must incur the expense of the travel pass. It is not sufficient for the employer to purchase a pass and recover the cost from the employee &ndash; in such circumstances the cost would be borne by the employee.</P>
      <P>In September 2000 the Revenue Commissioner's issued a statement in their tax briefing outlining the circumstances in which they would be prepared to accept that the cost had been borne by the employer where an employee forewent salary in favour of a travel pass. The necessary conditions are as follows: there must be a bone fide and enforceable alteration to the terms and conditions of employment exercising a choice of benefit instead of salary; the alteration must not be retrospective and must be evidenced in writing; there must be no entitlement to exchange the benefit for cash; the choice exercised, that is, benefit instead of cash cannot be made more frequently than once a year and then only with the consent of the employer.</P>
      <P>The introduction in the Civil Service of the travel pass scheme provided for in the 1999 Finance Bill, which underpins Government policy on greater use of public transport, is currently being examined.</P>
      <P>Following recent discussions with the staff side at general council, all Departments and offices were contacted for their observations on the introduction of such a scheme. A number of scheduling and technical problems, highlighted by Departments, are being examined.</P>

      <Quest>the response his Department has received to the letter written to the Irish Bankers Federation sug gesting that it draw up a code on branch closure to ensure continued access for those affected by bank closures; the role the new Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will play in monitoring the closure of bank branches; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14237/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I might clarify the record by stating that my Department did not write to the Irish Bankers' Federation about drawing up a code of practice on bank closures. I had initially signalled my concerns about branch closures to the IBF at a meeting last November. The matter was raised subsequently with the IBF by officials from my Department at a meeting on 21 February last which, <i>inter alia</i>, discussed the question of a code of practice.</P>
      <P>Since then, the IBF has written to me to say that it is looking into the issue of developing a code of practice to cover bank or customer communication around the issue of branch restructuring.</P>
      <P>I have no statutory function in regard to decisions relating to the location or size of bank branch networks. Such matters are the prerogative of the credit institutions themselves and they must be free to make decisions on the maintenance, closure or opening of branches on the basis of their own commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I can and do appreciate the concerns that arise at local level when branch closures are proposed. While banks cannot be forced to maintain branches in particular locations regardless of commercial realities, I also acknowledge the public's legitimate concerns about such closures. Any such restructuring should be done in a sensible and intelligent manner and should also be done in partnership with customers.</P>
      <P>In this context I welcome proposals by the IBF to develop a code of practice on branch restructuring and officials from my Department will be happy to assist the IBF in this regard if required.</P>
      <P>With regard to a possible role for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority in relation to this matter, as I have previously advised the House, a report on strategic issues facing the banking sector was published by my Department in August 2000. It examined this issue and recommended that, </P>
      <P>The banking industry needs to develop a strategy, whether involving agency arrangements with other non-bank retail outlets, electronic arrangements or otherwise, to address the issues of maintaining appropriate mechanisms for and levels of access, in all regions and by the different social groups, to bank services in the context of possible future developments such as internet banking, closure of branches and rationalisation in the branch banking system. The regulatory authority for the financial services sector should monitor and report on this from a customer perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will have a strong <Col N="957" /> focus on consumer issues and, in that context, I believe it would be appropriate for the new authority to monitor and report on access to banking services. In that way, the public generally and the Members of this House could have an authoritative source of information on the issues arising from the changes currently under way in the manner in which banks provide people with access to their services.</P>

    <P>Research on gender imbalance in the Civil Service at HEO level and above, commissioned as part of the SMI process, and published in 1999, showed that women were under-represented at senior management levels in the Civil Service and that progress towards a better balance of men and women in those grades had been minimal in the ten year period from 1987 to 1997.</P>
    <P>The main research findings, together with a package of measures based on the recommendations in the report, were endorsed by the Government and were presented by the Taoiseach and myself at the launch of the current phase of the strategic management initiative for the Civil Service in July 1999.</P>
    <P>In June 2000, the Government approved the new gender equality policy in principle and directed that consultations with the staff unions on the implementation of the new policy should begin. A final draft of the policy is now being considered by the unions. It is expected that this will be concluded shortly and then will be considered by the Government. It is hoped that the policy will be announced in the summer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 55 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The recent Supreme Court judgments in the case of Ó Beoláin <i>v.</i> District Judge Mary Fahy, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Ireland and the Attorney General confirms the Constitutional obligation of the State to ensure that the official translation into Irish of the statutes are made available to the general public and obliges the State to provide an official translation of the Rules of the District Court. The practice in relation to translation is that the translation branch of the Houses of the Oireachtas is responsible for the translation of statutes while individual Departments are responsible for their respective statutory instruments.</P>
      <P>In May 2000, my Department sanctioned the provision of additional staffing and financial resources to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Despite difficulties in identifying a sufficient number of suitably qualified staff, the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas have, following a competition for the recruitment of the additional staff in the translation branch, recently made seven offers of appointment. The Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas remain confident that they will be able to identify sufficiently qualified staff to fill all of the ten additional posts sanctioned by my Department. Work on the clearance of the arrears of Statutes awaiting translation will commence as soon as the additional staff have been appointed.</P>
      <P>As the Rules of the District Court are contained in a statutory instrument the issue of their translation is one for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently considering a number of options with a view to giving expeditious effect to the Supreme Court ruling.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced by public servants as a result of the refusal of banks to cash salary cheques; the discussions his Department has had with trade unions on this issue; the representations he has made to the banks on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the changes in procedures for cashing cheques introduced towards the end of last year by the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.</P>
      <P>My Department has had discussions with the two banks, which led to them modifying the new procedures as they apply to Government payments, and is in ongoing discussions with the trade unions about some local difficulties arising from this matter.</P>
      <P>Bank of Ireland introduced new procedures with effect from 13 November 2000, which require, in general, that cheques must be lodged to an account rather than be fully or partially cashed over the counter. The bank's stated reason was that the changes were necessary to ensure the bank complies with accepted European banking practices.</P>
      <P>As initially announced, the changes applied to all crossed cheques, cheques drawn on other branches and banks and third party cheques, but not to social welfare cheques, health board benefits where cheques are drawn on Bank of Ireland, and children's allowances.</P>
      <P>In December 2000, Allied Irish Banks introduced similar procedures. However, having consulted my Department, AIB decided not to apply the restriction to Government payments, and it continues to cash payable orders drawn on the Paymaster General and those from Office of Public Works, which is the only Vote whose payments are not processed through the PMG.</P>
      <P>Pending discussions with this Department, Bank of Ireland postponed the application of this restriction on payable orders drawn on the Paymaster General's office and on the Office of Public Works. Those discussions culminated in the bank introducing a modified form of the new procedures for Government payable orders. The main modifications were that the new restriction would not be applied to payments of pension to retired civil servants, teachers, gardaí and Army personnel and that, while other payable orders must be lodged to an account, the bank would not require that the customer wait for the normal clearance period of several days for access to the funds. The bank has committed to making the money available for withdrawal through an ATM by 9 p.m. on the day of lodgment, at the latest.</P>
      <P>Bank of Ireland decided to operate the new procedures on this basis for PMG payable orders from mid-March, and for Office of Public Works orders from the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with the other retail banks is as follows. AIB does not propose to apply the <Col N="961" /> restriction to any PMG payable orders; Ulster Bank and TSB require the customer to lodge the payable order and await the normal clearance period of five days and NIB will encash payable orders, but only for customers of the particular branch.</P>
    <P>Some staff have experienced local difficulties since then in cashing Government cheques. The issue was raised at the April meeting of the Joint Industrial Council by the group of unions representing State industrial employees. Discussions to resolve the issue are continuing. The issue has also been raised by the Civil and Public Services Union at the Civil Service General Council, and remains under consideration.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the look-back audits of deposit interest retention tax have been completed in respect of the period up to 5 April 1999. Details of these audits, covering 37 institutions with a total yield of £173 million, have already been published. I am advised that Revenue's approach was to complete the look-back audits covering the period up to 5 April 1999 before considering the period subsequent to that date.</P>
      <P>As regards the periods since 5 April 1999, the DIRT returns for 2000-01 were due and received within the last month. Revenue have indicated that they have also received submissions in respect of the periods after 5 April 1999 from most of the main financial institutions. Revenue is currently reviewing these returns and submissions and, following this analysis, they will determine the nature of the examination required to ensure that all DIRT due has been paid by the institutions concerned.</P>

      <P>The maximum amount that any individual can save under the new scheme is £200 per month. The <Col N="962" /> scheme is therefore designed to encourage regular savings, and not to facilitate lump sum savings.</P>
      <P>There is no general prohibition on the use of lump sum savings &ndash; whether in the form of a deposit account or not &ndash; to feed an SSIA. Such a general prohibition would be unworkable. However, section 848G(1)(f2&gt;c) of the Finance Act, 2001, specifically prevents an individual from using moneys in a connected account to drip-feed an SSIA.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have issued detailed guidelines to the financial institutions setting out the circumstances in which a deposit or other account will be deemed to be connected with funds held in an SSIA. For this purpose, in brief, an asset is connected with another asset if the terms under which either of them is acquired and held would be different if the other asset was not acquired and held.</P>

      <P>The current phase in the modernisation of the public service is set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, framework 1.4, the thrust of which is to continue to embed the strategic management approach and to achieve a number of key objectives over the period of the programme. These objectives are, the design and implementation of performance management systems; putting in place integrated human resource management strategies; improved organisational flexibility; and strengthening organisational capability.</P>
      <P>The successful achievement of these objectives is essential to ensuring quality improvements in service delivery and to enable the public service to be more responsive to changes in the needs of the users of its services.</P>
      <P>An outline of the specific actions to be pursued in the Civil Service and in the education, health and local government sectors to realise these objectives are set out framework 1.4 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These include, among other things, regulatory reform, improved financial management systems, further development of the systematic reviews of public expenditure, implementation of a range of human resource management initiatives including measures to support equality of opportunity and the development of e-government systems to support more flexible service delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has set a new context for the future development of the SMI modernisation programme by firmly linking pay to the achievement of the targets set for the modernisation programme, and by including an external dimension to the verification process. In this regard performance indicators are set for each sector of the public service, including the <Col N="963" /> Civil Service. The appropriateness and subsequent achievement of these indicators, at the level of each organisation will be independently assessed by a quality assurance group in each sector; these groups include external business and customer representation. Payment of the final phase of 4% under the PPF will be conditional on the targets set having been achieved.</P>

      <Quest>his views on recent Eurostat figures which show that Irish labour costs, comprising tax, pensions and social security, in industry and services, were the fourth lowest in the EU in 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Communities, recently published 1999 statistics which showed that average hourly labour costs in EU industry and services ranged from a low of £7 in Portugal to a high of around 27 in Germany, Denmark and Austria. The average for the 15 EU member states was 21.5 and the countries below the EU average in descending order, were the UK, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;labour cost&rdquo; is defined as the expenditure borne by employers to employ workers, which include bonuses and gratuities, taxes and social security contributions, payments to saving schemes of employees and benefits in kind.</P>
      <P>The hourly labour cost for Ireland at 16.2 euro was 75% of the EU average. However, the direct remuneration element of our labour costs were 85% of the EU average. The structure of labour costs varies significantly from one member state to another, mainly reflecting different tax, pension and social security systems. This Government, in particular, has made progress in improving the return from work through reducing the tax burden. As outlined in the Budget Book for 2001 average tax rates have been reduced at all levels of income over the last four budgets, but most notably at lower income levels.</P>
      <P>Our lower labour costs compared to our competitors has been a significant factor in maintaining our competitiveness and delivering the very significant growth experienced in recent years.</P>
      <P>One area of concern is the fact that our wage increases are much higher than elsewhere. Labour shortages can be expected to exert upward pressure on wage demands and there is a view that a gradual loss of competitiveness will slow the economy to a more sustainable rate of expansion. However, there is a danger that overshooting of wages could sharply erode our competitiveness which might have a lasting negative impact on output and employment.</P>

      <P>I indicated previously in a number of replies to questions on this matter that I was awaiting the outcome of the examination of the steering group report by the Committee of Public Accounts Sub-Committee on Certain Revenue Matters and that I would consider the findings of the Sub-Committee. The Committee of Public Accounts Parliamentary Inquiry into DIRT Final Report was published on 3 April and I am currently considering the committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a steering group from my Department, which included two members from the private sector, carried out a review of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. It produced a report containing 48 recommendations involving corporate governance arrangements, accountability, Revenue's core business, organisation structures and support services, and management procedures. In particular, the review recommends the establishment of a new governing board of Revenue to replace the current statutory board to comprise the current Revenue chairman, the other two Revenue Commissioners, and three independent non-executive directors, one of whom should be vice-chairman. The Committee of Public Accounts Parliamentary Inquiry into DIRT Final Report considered the report of the steering group and also recommended that the board of the Revenue Commissioners should have three executive and three non-executive members but that one of non-executive members should be Chairman.</P>
      <P>I am giving careful consideration to the recommendations in these two reports and as soon as I have completed my consideration of the issues involved, I will bring proposals to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners advise me that <Col N="965" /> they have already taken a number of measures to implement the steering group's recommendations in areas which do not require Government decisions. These recommendations are concerned with the extensive changes in the way Revenue is internally organised below board level and take account of Revenue's own proposals following a root and branch review undertaken by them. My Department has sanctioned an extra 31 posts to provide the resources necessary to advance this work.</P>

    <P>The investigation of fraud with a view to prosecution is a slow and painstaking process, often <Col N="966" /> relying on a complex paper trail of evidence to assist in establishing the guilt of the accused. The requirement to prove the guilt of the accused &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; places a very heavy onus on the prosecution.</P>

    <P>Last year, the Revenue organisation review, which was produced by top level management in Revenue, identified the need to establish a new Revenue prosecution division to allow the expertise and experience in Revenue to be harnessed to greatest effect in processing prosecutions. The proposal was endorsed in the review undertaken by the Department of Finance steering group, which was set up as a result of a recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts Sub-Committee on Certain Revenue Matters, and has been identified by the Revenue Commissioners as a matter requiring priority.</P>
    <P>A project team to implement the proposals will be set up shortly and it is expected that the new division will be established by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The Government announced on 20 February its intention to establish the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority within the new structure of the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Authority.</P>
      <P>Planning for the implementation of that decision is well under way. At the end of March I appointed A&amp;L Goodbody as legal advisers to assist me in the preparation of heads of legislation. They have been working with officials of my Department to review the very substantial body of legislation dealing with insurance and banking regulation which will be affected by the proposal.</P>
      <P>Early in April, officials of my Department had an initial briefing session with the European Central Bank which proved very constructive. We will be consulting the ECB formally when the legislative proposals have been finalised. It is my intention to ensure that the proposals in their final form are fully consistent with the role of the ECB as laid down in its Statute.</P>
      <P>I have also established a working group including officials from my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Central Bank who are liaising in relation to the preparation of legislation and the transfer of functions. The Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs are also being consulted.</P>
      <P>It is my current intention to bring a Memorandum to Government in June outlining the provisions which would be included in legislation to establish the IFSRA. A range of closely related proposals concerning the establishment of a statutory ombudsman scheme, consumer and industry consultative panels and dealing with other financial services regulation issues are being developed in parallel. These are an essential part of the overall package of measures to provide a renewed focus on the consumer issues arising in relation to financial services regulation. It is my intention that these changes would be provided for in a Bill which will be brought to Government as soon as they are ready.</P>
      <P>The target date for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority to open its doors is the beginning of 2002 and I would hope to be in a position to introduce legislation in the autumn session to provide for this. In order to facilitate that target, I intend, in consultation with the Tánaiste, to set up an interim board for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority on a non-statutory basis in advance of its formal establishment.</P>

      <P>The Paymaster General's office carries out two principal functions: it acts as a clearing bank for Government payments and it pays the pensions of retired civil servants. While there are a number of linkages between the two areas, they are in effect distinct and separate entities.</P>
      <P>The banking side of the PMG's operates as the bank for all the Votes, except that of the Office of Public Works, and in respect of various other funds. It interacts between the clearing banks and the Departments, settling the banks' claims for the payable orders lodged with or encashed by them, and checking those claims against payment authorisations received from Departments.</P>
      <P>The PMG pensions section is responsible for the payment of superannuation benefits to retired civil servants or to their spouses and children. It also pays such benefits to retired members of the Judiciary, and to former holders of ministerial and other offices. There are approximately 14,700 pensioners on the pensions payroll.</P>

      <P>Regarding the Deputy's question of how European economic policies compare with those in other countries throughout the world, the economic strategies being followed in Europe, just like those in the US and Japan have to be tailored to the particular economic needs of the country or region in question.

The analysis and assessment of taxation measures will be overseen by the tax strategy group, which is chaired by an official from my Department.

      <P>Taxation can play a part in attaining environmental goals.

I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Government's policy in introducing the new regime for taxi licences, section 51 of the Finance Act 2001 provides for a new scheme of capital allowance for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances are effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date.</P>
      <P>The actual cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum in line with the new write-off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery. The write-off will be allowed against the trading income only of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if additionally, the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis, then the cost can be written off against both the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage of the 2001 Finance Bill, I introduced some further refinements to the provision as it then stood and these are now also reflected in section 51 of the Act. The objective was to address certain &lsquo;hardship' cases that had been brought to the my attention. Accordingly, section 51 also provides that where a licence was inherited from a deceased spouse who carried on a taxi trade the licence holder may offset the capital expenditure incurred on the original acquisition of the licence against the rental income from the licence, even if there is no trading income from the licence. This measure will only be available in respect of one licence. In cases where inheritance tax or probate tax was paid in respect of a taxi licence, the value used for such tax pur<Col N="971" /> poses may be used instead of the actual capital expenditure cost, if that value is higher.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage I further extended the provisions of section 51 to cater for the situation where a widow or widower, who has inherited the licence from his or her spouse, lets the licence to a third party who provides the associated vehicle.</P>
    <P>As I said on both the Committee and Report Stages, what has been offered to taxi drivers affected by deregulation is a much improved position on that which existed beforehand. Those taxi drivers can now offset the cost of their taxi licences against both their trading income and, in the case mentioned above, their rental income, on the basis of one licence only per licence owner. Previously, a taxi licence owner would not have been allowed to write off the expenditure incurred in buying a plate against his or her income.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to make further changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about the changes I made to the new provisions relating to the tax treatment of share options. I understand that these concerns related to the amendment made on Committee Stage of the Finance Act, 2001 which allows the amended tax treatment to apply to share options exercised on or after 15 February 2001, rather than granted on or after that date as provided for in the Finance Bill as published.</P>
      <P> I should point out that, under the normal treatment of share options, the charge to income tax arises when the option is exercised, that is, when the shares are purchased. Under provisions I made in the Finance Act, 2000, the tax charge may be deferred for a period of seven years or until the shares are actually sold, whichever is the earlier. The income tax applies to the difference between the price paid and the market value of the share on the date of purchase. Any subsequent gains in the value of the shares would be subject to capital gains tax when the shares are sold.</P>
      <P>There is no question of retrospective tax relief under the new provisions as the particular tax treatment will only arise where options are exercised after 15 February 2001, the date of publication of the Bill. If the options are exercised before the scheme is approved by the Revenue Commissioners, they will qualify for the new relief provided the scheme is approved before 31 December 2001 and that at the time of both the grant and the exercise &ndash; if that is prior to approval &ndash; the scheme would have been capable of being approved had the legislation been in force at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> I introduced these new provisions relating to the tax treatment of share options to encourage wider employee share ownership but also to encourage employee retention and to attract staff in a competitive international environment. Representations were made to me that confining the new relief to options granted after 15 February 2001 would be an undesirable feature as it could result in companies losing staff, who already held unexercised share options which on purchase of the shares would give rise to an income tax charge. Such employees could be induced to leave their current employment if they obtained offers of new share options from other employers which would benefit from the new tax treatment. In the light of these representations, I decided to introduce an amendment to the new provisions on Committee Stage of the Bill which applies the new tax treatment to options exercised on or after 15 February 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal in turn with the non-pay and pay aspects of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>As the Minister responsible for the Civil Service, I am keenly interested in ensuring that it can recruit and retain a high quality workforce. The Civil Service has more than 30,000 employees. To perform their jobs and undertake their roles effectively these staff must be trained and developed in a way which responds to their aspirations for more challenging and fulfilling work. This involves more focused training and development based on the performance management and development system. It also involves improved career paths and better workplace conditions which enhance job satisfaction and motivation, and lead to more effective performance. These are important elements in promoting the Civil Service as an &ldquo;employer of choice&rdquo; in the current highly competitive labour market.</P>
      <P>The ongoing development of policies which are sensitive to employees' commitments outside the workplace is a critical component of the Civil Service response to the tight labour market. The Civil Service as an employer has always been a leader in introducing such &ldquo;family friendly&rdquo; policies. Since the mid-1980s, the job-sharing scheme has allowed staff to apply to work half their normal hours in a number of combinations such as a split week or a week-on, week-off pattern. Discussions with staff representatives on a new worksharing scheme are at an advanced stage. It is intended that this scheme will expand the existing pattern of job sharing by providing a much wider range of attendance patterns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as I announced in the budget speech, £10 million is to be made available over the next two years to build 15 crèches for the children of civil servants. Work is well under way on the scheme for capital grants to fund premises and equipment for these crèches and to establish <Col N="975" /> a management structure to ensure proper childcare and management standards within these crèches.</P>
    <P>These policies are critical to ensuring true equality of opportunity for civil servants, irrespective of gender or family status and are becoming increasingly important in attracting and retaining committed and motivated staff.</P>
    <P>As regards the pay of Civil Service grades, I do not see a case for setting Civil Service pay at a level which would lead pay levels in the rest of the economy. However, a fundamental part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, as far as the public service is concerned, is the provision for a benchmarking exercise which will carry out a comparative examination of pay and jobs in the public and private sectors. Effectively this will deliver a pay review for the public service. In its terms of reference the benchmarking body is specifically asked to have regard to the need to recruit and retain staff. Practically all the major public service groups, including grades represented by the Civil and Public Service Union and the Federated Union of Government Employees, the unions representing the lower paid grades in the Civil Service, are being directly considered in this exercise. The entry points of the clerical and other recruitment scales have already been improved by the removal of certain age points.</P>

      <P>The relocation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development laboratories and the State laboratory from Abbotstown to new facilities at Backweston, Celbridge, County Kildare is estimated at £157 million, including siteworks, construction costs, design team fees, VAT and inflation. A comprehensive estimate of the cost of moving the Marine Institute Laboratories from Abbotstown to Galway must await the acquisition of a site and the completion of a detailed brief of requirements, but the estimated construction cost of the new laboratories in Gal<Col N="976" /> way is £31 million, including inflation, fees and VAT.</P>
      <P>Following an agreement at departmental council, staff representatives are informed of the outcome of every meeting of the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and which is responsible for overseeing the relocation of laboratory facilities from Abbotstown.</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy no compensation or removal expenses will be paid to civil servants volunteering to relocate to Backweston and Galway. However, non-Civil Service fixed contract staff working at the Marine Institute who do not wish to move will benefit from a severance package which is being negotiated at present. The precise costs of this package will not be known until final agreement is reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is responsible for the development of the legal framework under which credit institutions are supervised and regulated. Once the necessary legislation has been enacted, responsibility for the supervision of credit institutions is then a matter for the Central Bank and I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory function in the matter on a day-to-day basis.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the regulation of banks is the primary responsibility of the Central Bank. I have been advised by the Central Bank that a bank which is not authorised to carry on banking business within Ireland may not advertise for or otherwise solicit deposits in Ireland. It may not hold itself out or represent itself as a bank here, and to do so would involve a breach of the law. However, in so far as the bank in question does not hold an Irish banking licence, then the primary responsibility in regard to its regulation would rest with the authorities of the country in which it is licensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in response to a question from Deputy McDowell on this issue on 20 February and again to Deputy McManus on 3 April last, it is a matter for the relevant authorities here, including the Central Bank, the Garda Síochána and the DPP, to determine, first, whether there have been any breaches of Irish legislation in relation to money laundering and, second, what action to take if the law is broken. I understand that such determinations have not yet been concluded and in this context would note the strict <Col N="977" /> requirements as to confidentiality which apply to the Central Bank and the DPP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the course of discussions on the Finance Bill it is difficult to estimate the Exchequer cost of the special savings incentive scheme because of its very nature, it is new and innovative and the size of the Exchequer contribution will depend on take-up by participants in the scheme. In developing proposals for the Finance Bill provision my Department considered various ranges of costs depending on different assumptions. As I indicated on 20 February in reply to Parliamentary Question reference No. 4725/01 from Deputy Jim Mitchell, a tentative estimate is for a full-year cost of around £100 million for the savings scheme. In so far as the take-up turns out to be very strong, then this figure may have to be revised upward. The more successful the scheme, the more relief it will entail.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the scheme commenced on 1 May. My Department will be reviewing estimates of the cost of the scheme in the light of experience with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to Case C-404/99, Commission of the European Communities f2&gt;v. French Republic, concerning the exclusion from the taxable amount for the purposes of value added tax of the service charges claimed by certain taxable persons.</P>
      <P>We are still studying the judgment, which is binding, and what changes, if any, will be required in Irish procedures on foot of it. A somewhat similar situation applies in Ireland and it is being considered by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission argued that the French Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 2(1) and 11A(1)(a) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the member states relating to turnover taxes. The Commission, in its application, was solely concerned with service charges, which are paid on a compulsory basis by the customer and the amount of which is deter<Col N="978" /> mined in advance, and not with tips paid spontaneously and without compulsion by the customer to a given employee.</P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice found that it is clear that the system of exemption from VAT, allowed by the French tax authorities in the context of an administrative concession which is confirmed by the 1976 instruction, and which derogates from the rules laid down by Articles 2(1) and 11A(1)(a) of the Sixth Directive, does not fall within any of the situations covered by Article 11A(3) of that directive. The court also found that it follows that the service charge element must be included in the taxable amount for VAT purposes attributable to the service provider concerned, and that there are no circumstances in which a supplier may be permitted to exclude such charges from his taxable amount for VAT purposes.</P>
    <P>The court concluded that factors advanced by France regarding the historical and political context and the social objective underlying the exemption of service charges from VAT are irrelevant for the purposes of assessing the compatibility of the concession in question with the rules laid down by the Sixth Directive.</P>

      <P>The provision of jobs is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies, and not one for which I, as Minister, would have a direct function.</P>
      <P>The Government, through the enterprise development agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. My Department and the development agencies are seeking to ensure that the required investments in economic and social infrastructure to achieve balanced regional development are identified and put in place. The co-ordination of policy is continuously pursued and achieved through a number of mechanisms between my Department, Forfás and the development agencies.</P>
      <P>Job losses are occurring mainly as a result of the restructuring process which is going on in industry in Ireland whereby activities, and hence jobs, at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context. Unfortunately, the slowdown in the US economy is having a negative impact on the overseas-owned manufacturing sector in Ireland. In addition to job losses directly associated with this downturn, some of the major multinationals have temporarily halted recruitment or slowed the build up of planned expansions. Despite the scale of the downturn in the US economy over recent months, however, the impact to date on the Irish economy in terms of GNP growth, and employment/unemployment has been small. IDA Ireland hopes to create about 12,000 new jobs in 2001, which is high by historical standards.</P>
      <P>A report which I recently commissioned from Forfás, the industrial policy advisory agency under my Department's aegis, concluded that, on the whole, the impact of a temporary downturn in the US economy should be manageable, and may even help reduce inflationary pressures. A deeper and more prolonged US slump would, of course, have more serious and long-term implications for the Irish economy. The recent job losses and the US downturn reinforce the need to maintain a cost-effective and competitive environment for foreign direct investment and business generally, to avoid wage increases that undermine competitiveness and to make progress on issues such as infrastructure, skills shortages and deregulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the indigenous sector, increasing competitiveness is essential for indigenous firms if they are to be successful in improving their positions in global markets. Enterprise Ireland, which works with indigenous industry, is mindful of the need to encourage its client companies to focus on maintaining competitiveness in an increasingly global economy, and against the background of perceived threats to the more traditional sectors of industry from low cost economies. The emphasis of Enterprise Ireland's <Col N="980" /> financial interventions has moved from capacity-building to capability-building supports. Enterprise Ireland is addressing an imbalance in the venture capital market as a priority and is very close to finalising a number of public-private partnership venture capital funds in the regions. The new funds will focus on accelerating the rate of new technology start-ups with high growth potential. In addition, the agency has sought expressions of interest from private sector venture fund managers to participate in a new seed and venture fund initiative, which will be funded through the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development continues to manage and promote Shannon Free Zone as a location for inward investment. In particular, in recent years there has been a strong marketing effort around new internationally traded and high quality service jobs. There continues to be a well-diversified industry base on the Shannon Free Zone which, I believe, provides a sound basis for future growth in the region.  I am confident that the industrial development agencies in implementing the various commitments contained in the national development plan will continue to play a crucial role in encouraging investment and in contributing high levels of job creation to our economy over the coming years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directive in 1994, European Communities (Life Assurance and Non-Life Insurance) Framework Regulations, 1994, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU, on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries and has increased choice of product to the benefit of the Irish consumer. Currently, there are 27 insurers authorised to underwrite motor insurance in Ireland. Fifteen companies have their headquarters in Ireland, 11 are based in other EU member states and one is a non-EU insurer. In addition, I believe that the removal of the cap on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> The underwriting criteria used by insurers are normally based on their experience of underwriting particular risks. This includes trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular segments of risks of the insurance market and classes of risk and are a matter for judgment by individual private insurance companies. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The MIAB will be reporting later this year and I will take whatever further action is appropriate towards the goal of the reduction of the cost of motor insurance.</P>
    <P>It would appear desirable that there should be greater transparency in the underwriting and pricing of motor insurance. However, it should be remembered that these are issues upon which insurance companies make decisions and EU law limits the extent to which we can intervene in the pricing and underwriting of insurance in this country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am confident that the establishment of the personal injury assessment board will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation for work related injuries, in its initial term of operation, and later in motor injury cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 to 78, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>FÁS operate a computerised tracking system to ensure that priority clients are given ongoing assistance to help them enter employment. Comprehensive support services are provided by FÁS to assist persons who lose their jobs or are made redundant following factory closures in Donegal. Priority supports are given to groups of redundant workers, for example, Fruit of the Loom, special needs clients and unemployed persons referred for supports by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to FÁS under the national employment action plan. This system operates on an individualised basis with each person being case loaded and allocated to an employment services officer.</P>
      <P>Detailed tracking of the FÁS client status from their computer-based caseload reveals that in the case of persons made redundant from Fruit of the Loom by May of this year, 89% were not signing-on the Live Register. FÁS does not have employment details in respect of these clients. As regards the remaining 11% of persons who remain on the FÁS caseload system, these persons continue to be assisted by FÁS.</P>
      <P>FÁS have provided details in the following table of the number of people who have been recorded as having availed of retraining as a result of redundancies or closures in Donegal in each year since 1998:</P>

    <P>FÁS take local actions to assist the unemployed in response to areas affected by job losses. Two recent examples are in respect of Ballybofey/ Stranorlar Nena Mode's, and Letterkenny/Donegal Foods. In addition, persons previously affected by redundancies are being retargeted where such persons require a retraining intervention.</P>
    <P>In the time available and due to the extensive and complex nature of the FÁS support service, it has not been possible to provide a more comprehensive response beyond the preliminary information indicated in my reply above. Additional information can be gained on the full range of FÁS services and outcomes and progression of FÁS clients from the Regional Director in the north west, Mr. Michael Tully and the training services director for Donegal, Mr. Michael McGlynn and a meeting with them can be arranged at the Deputy's convenience.</P>

      <P>In common with other food producing industries, the fish farming sector makes use, as necessary, of veterinary medicinal products to combat and control disease and parasites. Sampling and monitoring programmes for farmed fish are carried out by the Marine Institute under EU Directive 96/23. Farmed fish are monitored for a wide range of residues which fall into the following broad categories: substances having anabolic effects and unauthorised substances; veterinary therapeutants, including antibiotics and sea lice treatments; and environmental contaminants, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, lead, cadmium and mercury.</P>
      <P>In addition, new EU legislation regarding feedstuffs coming into force towards the end of this year will require the monitoring of certain chemicals and residues in animal and fish feed.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has been working closely with the Marine Institute which has been monitoring PCBs, organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals in wild fish for a number of years, and more recently in farmed fish. There are, as yet, no EU standards for PCBs in fish. Analysis of sampling undertaken as part of the 1999 programme for Irish farmed fish shows that the concentration of PCBs was considerably lower than the strictest international standards. The FSAI in liaison with the Marine Institute is currently carrying out a survey into dioxin and PCB levels in farmed and wild salmon and trout. The results of the survey which will be published by the FSAI, will be available later this year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a 1999 study by the Food Contaminants Division of the British Ministry for Agriculture and Food which suggests that if we eat fish more than twice a week we are likely to exceed dioxin and PCB intakes considered safe by the World Health Organisation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In August 1999, the UK Ministry for Agriculture and Food &ndash; MAFF &ndash; issued a bulletin on dioxins and PCBs in marine fish. In light of a survey and report carried out for MAFF and the Ministry of Health, the independent expert committee on toxicology of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment recommended that adults follow the advice of the committee on the medical aspects of nutrition <Col N="984" /> and food policy that individuals should consume one portion of oily fish per week as part of a balanced diet.</P>
      <P>Polychlorinated biphenyls &ndash; PCBs &ndash; are persistent organic pollutants that are principally the result of industrial processes. The UK report did not conclude that if consumers eat more fish more than twice a week they are likely to exceed dioxin and PCB intakes considered safe by the WHO. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has stated that there is no evidence to date that fish consumed in Ireland is endangering public health with respect to PCBs and dioxins.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organisation has not recommended a maximum daily intake for salmon. In addition, WHO in a statement of clarification issued on 5 January 2001, advised that contrary to media reports, it has not received or reviewed purported data showing higher levels of chemicals, including dioxins, in farmed salmon compared to wild varieties.</P>

      <P>Tidal restrictions, poor ground conditions, procurement procedures and some technical difficulties with the bearing pile installation, which have now been overcome, have added to the planned duration for the construction of this project.

    <P>(a)The £441,590 is inclusive of £291,215 in overdue landing fees eventually paid in August 1999. Receipt of this payment had the effect of artificially inflating the landing charges income at the harbour for 1999. The £291,215 had accumulated due to a campaign of withholding landing charges by the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation.</P>

      <P>Research is ongoing at national and international level into all potential interactions between farmed fish and wild stocks. While concerns have been expressed about possible genetic impacts and transmission of disease, from farmed to wild stocks, there is no clear evidence to support these concerns and in the case of disease transmission it is probable on evidence to date that there is more risk of endemic disease passing from wild stocks to farmed stocks.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the estimate of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences that a fish farm producing one hundred tons of salmon in 2000 produces the equivalent in untreated waste of a small town; if farming on this scale exists here; and if so, the location.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall objective of Government policy is to support the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector in harmony with other marine users and with the environment. The capacity of any water body is dependent on a wide variety of factors at any one time. In this <Col N="989" /> context it should be noted that aquaculture depends fundamentally on a clean environment.</P>
      <P>Independent reviews of water quality data relating to Irish salmon farms carried out since 1990 have all shown that there is no evidence that fish farming has had any significant impacts on the marine environment. Irish marine finfish farms are located at sites off the northern, south western and western seaboard and the licensed production of all farms exceeds 100 tonnes per annum.</P>
      <P>Each application for aquaculture licensing is assessed against a range of parameters including, site, location and environmental impact. All finfish farming licensing proposals must be accompanied by a detailed environmental impact statement as to the potential impact of waste on the receiving environment. The composition of waste derived from salmon farms differs considerably from domestic or industrial waste and does not contain pathogenic bacteria or viruses of potential human health significance, or indeed heavy metals.</P>
      <P>Ongoing technical improvements in production methods and dramatic improvements in food conversion ratios have contributed to a steady significant reduction in the waste organic matter and nutrients output per kilogram of fish produced. Technological developments have also facilitated operations at high energy offshore sites with excellent water exchange and have resulted in a significantly more efficient and environmentally sustainable industry.</P>
      <P>Stringent management practices and controls governing the operation of fish farms are in place and monitored. In May 2000, five aquaculture protocols were introduced by my Department with the support of the fish farming industry as part of an overall strategy to underpin the highest environmental standards for the Irish aquaculture sector. The protocols include requirements that all finfish farms must have in place comprehensive monitoring programmes covering both the water column and sediments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other food producing industries the fish farming sector makes use as necessary of veterinary medicinal products under EU Directives to combat and control disease and parasites. The administration of animal remedies in Ireland is governed by the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996 which transposes into Irish law EU legislation regarding the supply and use of veterinary medicines in the EU. The regulations were introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="990" /> Food and Rural Development under powers contained in the Animal Remedies Act, 1993. The regulations also lay down rules for the administration of animal remedies and certain matters relating to veterinary practice in relation to animal remedies.</P>
      <P>Disinfectants are used by the industry in foot-baths and in the cleaning of fish tanks and equipment. Only ova are directly treated with disinfectant. There are currently no anaesthetics licensed for use in fish farming. While a number of antibiotics are licensed for use in finfish farming, in practice antibiotics are rarely used by the industry. Sampling and monitoring programmes carried out by the Marine Institute under EU and national regulatory frameworks encompass fish health status, testing for residue levels and environmental impact. These programmes ensure that the highest food safety standards and best environmental practice are complied with by the industry.</P>

      <P>With regard to the development of aquaculture in Ireland, I fully share the aspiration set out in the 1997 Strategy Report on Sustainable Development that human activity must not undermine the long-term productivity of supporting ecosystems.</P>
      <P>At global level, statistics show that there has been little change in recent years in the world catch of industrial fish. Approximately 20% of world fishmeal production is used in aquaculture. Fishmeal is important also to many other industries, such as the pet food market, some livestock operations and chicken farming. The latter are the highest consumers of fishmeal. From a protein utilisation point of view, the amount of dietary protein retained by salmon is approximately twice that of swine and chicken. It is considered that if aquaculture ceased using fishmeal in feeds, this would not impact on landings of fish for fishmeal due to the strong competition for supplies from other sectors. Nevertheless, at international level research is being directed at the development of alternative sources of protein and lipids for use in aquaculture. Much of the fishmeal used in Irish aquaculture comes from the managed pelagic species of the North Atlantic such as herring and blue whiting and by-products of fish processing.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 85 of 22 March 2001, the 2000 area aid application for the person named was selected for inspection in accordance with EU regulations. The final result of this inspection which involved two visits to the holding is that the person named claimed a total of 8.12 hectares on his 2000 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 6.51 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 1.61 hectares or 24.70% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore in this case as the overclaim is greater than 20%, no area aid related payments can issue in respect of 2000.</P>

      <P>The range of controls currently in place under relevant EU and national legislation with the objective <i>inter alia</i> of minimising the risk of transfer of antimicrobial resistance via the food chain can be categorised as follows: authorisation procedure for veterinary medicines &ndash; applicants for marketing authorisations for individual products are required under relevant EU pharmaceutical legislation to address the issue of potential transferred resistance in the extensive application dossiers submitted to regulatory authorities &ndash; in Ireland the Irish Medicines Board &ndash; in accordance with the current <Col N="996" /> state of scientific knowledge. In addition, marketing authorisations issued in respect of each medicine include a mandatory post-treatment withdrawal period in order to protect consumers from exposure to residues above scientifically acceptable levels, i.e. maximum residue limit; prescription rules and record-keeping &ndash; the rules in place in Ireland governing the prescription by veterinarians of antibiotic treatments and the record-keeping requirements imposed on farmers are on a par with the strictest in the EU; residue surveillance, under the national residue plan, which is approved by the European Commission, Ireland carries out extensive testing to detect the presence of antibiotic residues, the results of which are released annually and are available on the Department's website; self-monitoring, within the past two years my Department has required processors to draw up, in line with Department criteria, and implement their own annual residue monitoring programmes, the results of which are available to the Department and in relation to which it takes an over-seeing and audit role.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the measures currently in place, we cannot afford to be complacent about antibiotic resistance given the potential serious implications for public health and also our farming systems. Much work remains to be done at scientific level in order that we may fully understand the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the part played by antimicrobial treatments, human and veterinary, in this regard. I have fully supported those strategies adopted at EU level in the framework of the Agriculture Ministers Council to address this threat. At national level, my Department has also been active, in co-operation with the FSAI, through an extensive programme of testing in the poultry sector for the presence of antibiotic residues and also for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The results of this exercise, once completed, will be assessed, in conjunction with the developing state of scientific knowledge generally, to determine what further actions may be necessary.</P>

      <P>Pesticides are one of the many types of chemicals used in the production of food. Pesticides which are prohibited for use in agricultural production in Ireland have tolerances, MRL's, set at the limits of determination.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to know in advance if prohibited pesticides are used in other countries. <Col N="997" /> However, if prohibited pesticides are used in other countries the controlling authorities in the EU member states have a rapid alert procedure in operation for notifying information throughout the EU if residues are detected which are considered to be harmful to the consumer.</P>

Third countries are also subjected to missions by inspectors from the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office for the purpose of verifying implementation of their control regimes.  </P>

      <P>Chlorpyriphos is an organophosphorous pesticide which is approved for use in Ireland and throughout the world. Chlorpyriphos is also approved for use in the United States by the USEPA.</P>
      <P>Residues of chlorpyriphos are found to be present in foods sold and consumed in Ireland. This is similar to the situation within the US where there are currently more than 40 different crops on which chlorpyriphos is approved for use. The EPA in the US is currently reviewing the pesticide chlorpyriphos with a view to ensuring that its use meets the current US EPA safety standards. A similar situation is taking place in the EU where chlorpyriphos is also being reviewed under the 91/414 directive and this will result in a common EU position being reached with respect to the future use of this pesticide. At present the current EU review does not indicate that there are particular concerns for human health associated with the use of chlorpyriphos according to good agricultural practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of the specific findings of the USEPA that chlorpyriphos can cause brain damage but I am aware that chlorpyriphos, being an organophosphorous pesticide, is a chlolinesterase inhibitor. Therefore, it can overstimulate the nervous system causing nausea, dizziness, confusion and at high exposure levels can cause respiratory paralysis and death. In the US following the current review by the EPA and following risk miti<Col N="998" /> gation procedures, the EPA indicate that acute risks are not of concern for the most highly exposed population sub-group which are children in the one to six year age group.</P>
    <P>Chlorpyriphos has also been reviewed by the UK Advisory Committee on Pesticides and it has concluded, in a communication to the EU commission, that there was no evidence for concern about short-term or acute exposure for the UK population associated with exposure to chlorpyriphos. It is considered that the levels of exposure to the Irish population to chlorpyriphos residues would be similar to the UK.</P>

There is controlling legislation in place to monitor this. In addition, many farmers participate in various quality assurance schemes under An Bord Glas, which require, for audit purposes, the recording of the type of information indicated.</P>

      <P>No research is being carried out in Ireland on this issue because of the difficulty in retaining research land in the longer term, as it is commonly required for other purposes. In fact, most international research has been confined to the short-term, namely some three years, for the same reason. Results in the short term have not indicated any significant adverse effects from the use of artificial fertilisers on the above issues. However, it appears that in the long-term the use of ammonium sulphate which has an acidifying effect on the soil can impact on sensitive organisms. The use of this fertiliser has declined enormously in recent years.</P>
      <P>With respect to pesticides, the rates of use in Ireland are moderate by international standards, so any adverse effects arising are only temporary, generally for one season. Furthermore any adverse effects are further alleviated by the fact that, with the advent of modern pesticides, most of the toxic materials such as organo-chlorines, insecticides, and copper-based fungicides have been replaced.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any link between poultry rearing methods and food poisoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a body of EU legislation in force in this country governing the production of poultrymeat. A primary objective of this legislation is <Col N="1001" /> protection of public health. As far as food poisoning is concerned, the correct handling and storage of product after slaughter, i.e. at the processing, marketing and catering stages and in the home, are of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>Antibiotics to combat poultry diseases must be approved in accordance with a strict statutory regime which, <i>inter alia</i>, takes account of the safety of the product from the point of view of human health. Under this regime, mandatory withdrawal periods are defined in respect of each product in order to protect consumers from harmful levels of residues. In addition, the rules in Ireland governing the prescription of antibiotic therapies are among the strictest in the EU. Furthermore, testing carried out under my Department's residues monitoring programme indicates that there is a very high level of compliance with regulatory requirements in this area.</P>

The legislation will apply to financial institutions generally such as banks, building societies, insurance companies and the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>
      <P>Work on the drafting of the enabling legislation is progressing well and I intend to publish a Bill on this matter later this month. Due to the legal complexity of some of the issues arising in regard to dormant funds, a phased approach to the framework legislation is being pursued.

It will also apply to the Post Office Savings Bank savings certificates, savings bonds and instalment savings schemes &ndash; but not to prize bonds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the interdepartmental review group, under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was set up to review the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme. The principal issue of concern expressed by the public and by public representatives in connection with the reliefs under the scheme was, and still is, in relation to the medical criteria. Arguably, the continual pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its valuable reliefs giving access to tax free cars and motor fuel, in effect, for life. I understand that while no further written or oral submissions are expected the work of the group is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The qualifying disability criteria set out in the regulations relate essentially to persons who have severe permanent physical mobility problems. While the number of potential beneficiaries is unclear there are, I believe, up to 350,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. I expect that many of these persons are already fully self-sufficient in terms of private transportation. In any event not all of this number would or could use a widened scheme but the substantial tax benefits make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that the review group has no definite figures of the likely number of extra disabled persons who may benefit under the scheme should a widening of the scope of the medical criteria be agreed on completion of their review. Given the level of benefits available under the scheme the cost is quite considerable and extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with some dilemmas. As Deputies are aware, the scheme is not means <Col N="1007" /> tested and the average benefit per person is approximately £4,000 on the basis that more than 90% of the present cohort of beneficiaries claim in respect of the purchase of a new car every two years. Clearly the present level of benefits under the current scheme could be difficult to sustain even if a fraction of the 350,000 people were allowed to gain admittance to it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties which people who suffer from some form of physical disability face in coping with everyday life, particularly with regard to transportation. I can assure the House that any proposals &ndash; whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise &ndash; which may emanate from the review group will receive full consideration.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are currently making alterations to the design of the Shinkeen stream drainage scheme which will alleviate flooding at Hazelhatch, Celbridge, County Kildare. These amendments, which arose as a result of the observations submitted by the general public and landowners in the area following the exhibition of the scheme in <Col N="1008" /> December 2000, include channel improvements, channel realignment, bridge replacements and ancillary works such as fencing, spoil treatment, environmental mitigation measures and are designed to afford protection against a 100 year flood event rather than the 50 year flood protection originally proposed.</P>
      <P>Preparatory works on the scheme documentation required to have the scheme confirmed and advanced to works stage are being progressed within the severe constraints imposed by the current foot and mouth disease crisis. In the latter regard and all going well, it is envisaged that the scheme might reach works stage in July and be substantially completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>My decision to make nicotine replacement therapies available to medical card holders was taken on foot of recommendations made by the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group and the Advisory Forum established to support the task force in the implementation of strategy.</P>
      <P> A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the list of reimbursable items it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public. It is recognised that in order for the common list of reimbursable items to be considered comprehensive, certain products which are available over the counter in pharmacies must by their nature be included in the list.</P>
      <P>Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that would not normally satisfy these criteria because they are generally available over the counter and may be advertised directly to the public.</P>
      <P>In light of the recommendations that have been made to me I have decided, as an exceptional measure, to make the full range of nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders only. Evidence shows that the lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco. Accordingly, it is considered that this group are in greatest need of assistance in helping them to quit the habit. I have no plans to make nicotine replacement therapies available under the other community drug schemes. Zyban, which is only available on prescription, is included in the common list and is reimbursable on both the general medical services and community drugs schemes.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran report, entitled Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. These structural changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. It will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>As part of the orthodontic initiative, the Department has approved a proposal from the ERHA for a grant-in-aid scheme. Under the scheme patients who meet the criteria laid down for non urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders. The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months at which time its operation will be reviewed.</P>
      <P> A working group established to report on the implementation of the scheme in the board is currently continuing its work to finalise the scheme.</P>

      <P>The domiciliary care allowance was introduced by way of circular 24/73 and is administered by the health boards on my behalf. DCA is paid in respect of children under 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision at home substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age. The current rate of payment is £129.40 per month, effective from 1 April 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the following changes to the DCA scheme were announced in the budget on 6 December 2000 and came into effect from 1 April 2001: the introduction of a <i>pro rata</i> payment in respect of periods spent at home, that is weekends and holidays, by eligible children who normally reside in special schools or institutions; and the abolition of the DCA requirement that the disability must have been present for six months prior to the date of application. From 1 April 2001 children may become eligible from birth. The allowance is now payable with effect from the date of application.</P>
      <P>Occasionally payments may be backdated prior to the date of application if it is clear that the applicant was not aware of his/her entitlement. In these cases payment of the allowance may be back-dated to the date that the child would have become eligible if the applicant had been aware of his or her entitlement.</P>

      <P>The centre referred to by the Deputy, which is currently under construction and will accommodate 11 general practitioners from three separate group practices, is within five minutes of the town centre and is served by an urban bus route. The North-Western Health Board has not carried out a public consultation of its own in respect of this centre but the general practitioners concerned have carried out consultation with their practice populations. The board continues to engage with the local community regarding the development of the Markievicz House site and recently hosted a very successful open day with the local community development organisation.</P>
      <P>This development will provide for the development of general practice and primary care services for the Sligo urban area, approximately 30,000 persons, facilitating a wider range of services; improved collaboration-integration between general practitioners and the board's primary care staff, especially public health nurses, and in the development of significantly enhanced and modern state of the art premises.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of VHI concerning the matters raised by the Deputy. The VHI has confirmed that it provides cover for MRI scans. The VHI advised that because MRI scans are a very advanced technology with high costs and specific <Col N="1017" /> uses for which it is proven, it has set out specific rules and conditions for which benefit is payable. The benefits are outlined in rule 6K of the VHI's member handbook guide to plans and rules which states:</P>
      <P>We will pay the benefits set out in the table of benefits for an MRI scan subject to the following: (i) the member is referred for an MRI scan by a consultant; (ii) the MRI scan is carried out in an MRI centre listed in the directory of hospitals; (iii) the MRI scan is to investigate or rule out certain medical conditions. A list of the approved clinical indications for which benefit is payable appears at the back of the Member Handbook.</P>
      <P>The VHI has also advised that the list of clinical indications has evolved over the years and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. This process has resulted in the inclusion of a significant number of additional indications for which the use of MRI scanning has been proven as being clinically effective and also cost effective when compared with competing technologies.</P>
      <P>Coverage of benefits under health insurance contracts is subject to the provisions of the health insurance regulatory framework. These provisions include prescribed minimum levels of cover to which insured persons are entitled under health insurance contracts as specified in the Health Insurance Act, 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations, 1996, including the minimum coverage which must be provided in respect of MRI scans. Under the regulations insurers are allowed to apply excesses in the case of out-patient services, including MRI scans.</P>
      <P>The VHI complies with the provisions of the regulatory framework as regards coverage for MRI scans. It is a matter for all insurers to determine what benefits they are in a position to provide over and above those required under minimum benefit arrangements.</P>

      <P>Following the publication in June 2000 of the report by the National Social Work Qualifications Board entitled Social Work Posts in Ireland, discussions have been ongoing between officials of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. It has been agreed to create 68 additional training places in social work. This development places additional demands on health service employers to provide an appropriate number of additional practice placement opportunities.</P>
      <P>A number of practice placement co-ordinators will be put in place to co-ordinate this increased demand. In addition, a new grade of senior social work practitioner has been created and much of the responsibility of this new post will be the supervision of students on placement.</P>
      <P>Initial discussions have also taken place in relation to the establishment of a national forum on social work practice placements which will involve the placement co-ordinators, the colleges and the National Social Work Qualifications Board. A restructuring of the practice teacher training programmes is also planned to allow better support for those who take students on placement.</P>

      <P>Recent preliminary results from the North-South Ireland food consumption survey which was conducted by the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance highlights the levels of obesity and compliments the national health and lifestyle surveys published by my Department in February 1999.</P>
      <P>Two key lifestyle issues associated with obesity are healthy eating and physical activity. The National Healthy Eating Campaign, run by the health promotion unit of my Department, has over the past eight years raised awareness in the general public on healthy eating based on the food pyramid. Recently the campaign has encouraged the public to look at their fat intake and to reduce total fat, particularly saturated fat. This campaign stresses that the key to a healthy lifestyle is small gradual changes to eating and exercise habits in order to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. The theme of this year's national healthy eating campaign is ready, steady, go for low fat healthy eating and addresses healthy eating and physical activity behaviours associated with obesity.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the Ireland needs a change of heart campaign &ndash; a national mass media campaign to promote heart healthy lifestyles &ndash; will focus on physical activity. This campaign is due to be launched next week on 23 May. It will target the sedentary population, particularly older people, young people and the workplace.</P>
      <P>Both of these campaigns are run nationally in conjunction with the health boards.</P>

      <P>Salt intake, particularly in processed foods, is of concern to me and my Department especially as salt intake is associated with raised blood pressure. Today's lifestyle for many families means increased dependency on convenience foods which can be high in salt. Given our high rate of heart disease in Ireland, salt intake is an issue I am addressing in the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts.</P>
      <P>The healthy eating guidelines, developed by the health promotion unit of my Department, highlight that the diet of the Irish population should be based on fresh foods as far as possible. They also highlight the importance of tasting food before adding seasonings and recommend herbs and spices, including pepper, for flavour enhancement. The guidelines state that &ldquo;reliance on salt to flavour food is not recommended.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also supports the Irish Heart Foundation consensus statement on nutrition and <Col N="1021" /> heart health which advises that people eat less salt because current evidence suggests that salt intake is related to the increase in blood pressure which occurs as people get older. My Department also supports the Irish Heart Foundation's happy heart programmes for the workplace and restaurants which emphasise attention to salt intake.</P>
    <P>My plans with regard to focusing awareness on this problem include highlighting it in the Ireland needs a change of heart campaign, especially in the booklet issued to all households here. This year's national healthy eating campaign focuses on food on the go and convenience foods and while the main focus will be on reducing fat intake from these foods, reducing salt intake is also included.</P>
    <P>In the cardiovascular health strategy it is recommended that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland should examine dietary salt intake and advise on a national policy on salt. Food labelling, as required by the EU, provides for the provision of information on the sodium or salt content of food. There will be scope within the national policy on salt to address any further information required by the public with regard to the effects of salt on blood pressure and the interpretation of information provided on food labels. Attention is also likely to be paid to the information and education needs of patients with high blood pressure and related conditions.</P>

      <P>An endocrine disrupter is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters function(s) of the body's endocrine system and consequently causes adverse health effects in an intact organism or its progeny, or (sub) populations. The endocrine system is the complex biochemical signalling system mediated by hor<Col N="1022" /> mones. Alteration of endocrine function caused by an endocrine disrupter may be through interference with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, reproduction, development and-or behaviour.</P>
      <P>Industrial chemicals, household chemicals and chemicals in the environment, pollutants or natural contaminants, can be endocrine disrupters that mimic, enhance, called an agonist, or inhibit, called an antagonist, the action of hormones. The toxicity of a chemical does not mean that its presence in food is unsafe. For example, common salt is toxic at high levels but because these levels are rarely encountered in foods it is generally regarded as safe. Therefore, dose, body burden, timing, frequency and duration of exposure at critical periods of life are important considerations for assessing adverse effects of chemicals in foodstuffs, including endocrine disrupters.</P>
      <P>Endocrine disrupting chemicals are present in foods on sale in Ireland as they are in all other countries. Some of them are natural constituents of foods, for example, phytoestrogens in soya, some are industrial chemicals found in foods, for example, polychlorinated biphenyls, and others come from contact with food packaging material. Although there are associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals so far investigated and human health disturbances, a causative role of these chemicals in diseases and abnormalities possibly related to an endocrine disturbance has not been verified. Therefore, the general response of European food safety authorities is to minimise the exposure of the population whilst recognising that a zero exposure level is not achievable.</P>
      <P>In Ireland the Food Safety Authority and its agents monitor foodstuffs for these chemicals and use these data to assess exposure. Action is taken on the basis of exposure and is aimed at minimising the levels of these chemicals in certain foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>With regard to endocrine disrupting chemicals from packaging material, the authority has been working with the health boards to establish monitoring capability within the Public Analysts Laboratory Service. Resources have been made available and the PAL Service expects to be in a position to start monitoring this area in 2002.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if toxicology testing of chemicals used in food production encompasses a sufficient varied population of animals to ensure that findings of possible toxins is assessable in a manner that would be beneficial for the variety of humankind.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14478/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Chemicals used in food production must undergo rigorous safety <Col N="1023" /> evaluation before they are approved. This research must include toxicological tests or tests to determine whether a substance is harmful to humans. In these tests the chemical is administered to laboratory animals, usually mixed with their diet.</P>
      <P>There are basically two types of testing. First, the animals are exposed to concentrations of the chemical being tested that are much higher than will occur in human food. The animals are then subjected to observation and histopathological examination of tissues and organs. These tests are designed to elucidate the mechanism of intoxication and the likely sites of action within the body.</P>
      <P>The second type of test is the determination of a threshold level for the chemical. This requires the administration of decreasing doses of the chemical until a level is achieved whereby there is no effect on the animal. These threshold values are often called no effect level, also known as NOEL, or no adverse effect level, also known as NOAEL, although other measures do exist. In all of these tests sufficient animals are used to comply with the existing international animal testing regimes.</P>
      <P>Toxicological tests are designed to give information on any possible effects from short-term or long-term exposure to the proposed food chemical. Some effects include whether it may have any potential to cause cancer, also known as carcinogenicity, or affects male or female reproduction or the development of the embryo or the foetus if consumed by a pregnant woman which is called teratogenicity.</P>
      <P>Other effects include the mutagenic potential of the compound or mutagenicity. That is its ability to interfere with genetic material in the body which could lead to the development of cancer or adverse effects in future generations. In this regard different tests may use different animal species or sub-populations depending on the question that is being answered.</P>
      <P>Chemical safety assessments are carried out by bodies such as the European Unions' Scientific Committee on Food or the WHO/FAO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants. Safety assessments are only carried out when there is sufficient data based on many toxicological studies often carried out by independent researchers in many countries. The safety assessment will always try to set a threshold level for human exposure to the chemical being evaluated. To do this the threshold level in animals is reduced by a safety factor based on the likely action of the chemical on the human body. This results in such threshold measures as acceptable daily intake, tolerable weekly intake or an acute reference dose which is also referred to as ArefD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland relies upon the mechanisms within the European Union to legislate for chemicals in foodstuffs. In setting legislative limits the exposure of the European population, or suscep<Col N="1024" /> tible sub-population, is determined based on national monitoring and research. The maximum levels are then set to ensure that the population is not exposed to levels of the chemical above the threshold levels determined by the toxicologists. All additives, colours, sweeteners and pesticides must be approved based on the procedures described before being allowed onto the positive lists contained in the legislation. Only substances on the positive list used up to the maximum levels prescribed are legally allowed in foodstuffs. This is enforced in Ireland by the Food Safety Authority and its agents via national monitoring of the food supply.</P>

      <P>The International Agency for Research into Cancer has classified lindane as a group 2B carcinogen. Group 2B includes agents or mixtures which are possibly carcinogenic to humans.</P>
      <P>This category is used for agents, mixtures and exposure circumstances for which there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. It may also be used when there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In some instances an agent, mixture or exposure circumstance for which there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but limited evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals together with supporting evidence from other relevant data may be placed in this group.</P>

    <P>European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC of 30 June 1994 on colours for use in foodstuffs approves the use of canthaxanthin (E161g) as a food additive for the colouring of <Col N="1025" /> Saucisse de Strasbourg at a maximum level of 15 mg/kg.

    <P>I am advised by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland that canthaxanthin is an orange-red pigment also used as an animal feed additive for poultry and fish. It also occurs naturally in certain wild mushrooms, algae, crustaceans and wild fish.

      <P>The incidence of food poisoning in Ireland fell between 1999 and 2000, from 1,673 to 1,552 cases and the incidence of salmonellosis fell from 962 to 635. In the period 1998-2000 the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, was aware of 49 outbreaks of foodborne illness, of these about 20% were associated with shell eggs and 16% with poultry-poultry products. Concern about these numbers of poultry product associated illnesses led the FSAI to initiate industry and public information campaigns, that focused on the prevention of foodborne illness caused by these products. Initiatives such as the egg quality assurance scheme, that was organised in co-operation with the Irish Egg Producers Association and Bord Bia, awareness campaigns highlighting the use of pasteurised liquid eggs in the catering and food processing sectors, and public media campaigns, have all contributed towards the reduction in the numbers of cases of illness associated with poultry products over the past year.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that certain aspects of intensive farming can cause increased stress to animals thereby making them more susceptible to diseases. Antibiotics are used prophalactically to prevent disease as well as for treatment of animal diseases. They are also used as growth promoters in animal feeds. Recent scientific evidence links the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and the development of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens that can be passed to humans in the food chain. The FSAI advises a cautious approach to the use of antibiotics as growth promoters and avoiding the use of antibiotics that are closely related to those used in human medicine.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been taken in order to control the level of disease in poultry flocks. There is a salmonella control programme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development where poultry breeding flocks are slaughtered if they become infected with salmonella.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, have been aware of growing national and international concerns regarding the increase of food poisoning caused by campylobacter species, camplobacteriosos. In December 1999, the FSAI prepared a brief report for its Microbiology Sub-Committee. This report presented the facts and highlighted the gaps in knowledge. Last year the sub-committee convened a working group to examine the issues in detail and identify initiatives to combat this public health concern. The report from the FSAI will be published later this year.</P>
      <P>Prior to the establishment of the Food Safety Promotion Board, the FSAI conducted a number of media campaigns directed at making the consumer aware of how to combat food poisoning. Currently the FSAI is focusing its attention on improving standards of hygiene within the food industry. In 2000, over 10,000 food samples were taken under the national microbiological sampling programme that is co-ordinated by the FSAI, at retail and catering level. Some 2,320 of these were chicken samples. Some 789 chicken samples were specifically analysed for the presence of campylobacter of which 16.6% were found to be positive.</P>
      <P>Last year the FSAI in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development commenced an enhanced poultry monitoring scheme. Over 3,000 samples of raw poultry, including domestic and imported product, were analysed during 2000 and approximately 54% of samples were positive for Camplyobacter. The poultry isolates and human isolates, from the same time period, are currently being characterised in detail, in order to determine the relationship between handling-consuming contaminated poultry and human illness. Unlike many of the other food pathogens, campylobacter does not tend to cause outbreaks but more frequently results in sporadic illness. This pattern of illness greatly hinders identification of a food vehicle. Hence the above comparison will enable the FSAI to determine if the campylobacter isolates in poultry are the same as those causing illness in humans. This study will also examine the level of antibiotic resistance in Irish campylobacter isolates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the UK it has been calculated that for every 136 cases of infectious intestinal disease in the community, only one gets reported at the national surveillance level. This ratio for campylobacter was estimated to be one case reported for every 7.6 cases of illness. In Ireland, campylobacter is not a notifiable disease under the infectious disease regulations. Recognising the lack of national surveillance, the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, undertook a study to <Col N="1028" /> establish the number of laboratory confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis. The study found that during 1999, the Irish clinical laboratories confirmed 2,085 cases of campyloacteriosis. In its interim report published in August 2000, the NDSC states that &ldquo;the data reveals a crude incidence rate of 57.5 cases per 100,000 persons, making it the single biggest cause of bacterial food-poisoning in Ireland. This compares with a rate of 51/100,000 in Northern Ireland, 104.9 in England and Wales and 116 in Scotland. It must be reiterated that these are laboratory confirmed cases and the real burden of illness is higher.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The NDSC is examining the best way to reform the infectious disease regulations in order to improve surveillance at national level. In addition, the FSAI is currently involved in an all-island telephone survey to estimate the level of food poisoning in the population. This survey is being co-ordinated by a steering committee comprising the NDSC, the Department of Public Health Medicine and Epidemiology, University College Dublin, the Food Standards Agency Northern Ireland, the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre Northern Ireland, and the recently established Food Safety Promotion Board.</P>

      <P>This Government has increased the annual capital provision for library development from some £2.5 million to almost £6.9 million since it took office. In addition, over £1.4 million is available principally for information technology developments for users of the public library service in the current year.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to publication of the Branching Out report in 1998, local authorities were invited to submit a prioritised list of library projects so that a multi-annual expenditure programme could be formulated. The priority proposal identified by Kildare County Council at that time was for the construction of a library in Leixlip, the tender report for which is with my Department. Clarification was sought from the library authority on a number of items in the report and, although certain information is still awaited, I hope to be in a position to bring this matter to a conclusion in the near future. While no final figure can be approved until all information is received, I expect that this project will attract grant aid of over £1.8 million.</P>
      <P>A further review of the overall expenditure programme, taking account of updated priority lists submitted by library authorities, was undertaken by my Department this year. Following this review, I recently approved a new tranche of projects, and provision for a branch library in Kildare Town is included. Based on the library authority's estimates for the project, it should attract grant aid in the region of £375,000.</P>
      <P>The intention, arising from the Branching Out review of public library policy, is to undertake, in partnership with local authorities, a major redevelopment of our public library infrastructure over an eight year period from 1999 to 2006. While Kildare County Council has included other projects such as Kilcock on its priority list, these have been afforded a lower level of priority by the council than the projects mentioned earlier. It is not possible at this stage to say when such projects will receive funding.</P>

On taking up normal residence in Ireland, a person, on expiry of such a licence, may exchange it for an equivalent Irish driving licence without taking a driving test.</P>
      <P>Where the person has category D1, minibus, &ldquo;not for hire or reward&rdquo; entitlement on a UK driving licence, the person may not drive vehicles in category D1 in this country or may not exchange the licence for an Irish licence with category D1 entitlement. This is because the D1 &ldquo;not for hire or reward&rdquo; category of licence is a national category which is only valid in the UK and until recently was issued in the UK without the holder having passed a driving test in category D1. Consequently, it is not recognised in Ireland for driving or for licence exchange purposes.</P>
      <P>Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 to 2001, it is a matter for the appropriate local licensing authority to determine the eligibility of a person for a driving licence and to issue licences.</P>

Subsequently my Department wrote to those local authorities in the area covered by the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, the other county boroughs and their surrounding counties and to Louth and Westmeath County Councils seeking proposals for suitable large scale residential development sites that could be considered for designation as SDZs. Proposals were received from Cork, Fingal, Louth, Meath, South Dublin, Westmeath and Wicklow County Councils and Dublin and Waterford Corporations seeking the designation of a total 25 sites. Following an evaluation of the 25 sites suggested, I approved 11 sites for further consideration in October last. Additional information was sought from the local authorities and a detailed evaluation of the shortlisted sites is being finalised. It is my intention that the Government will be in a position to designate the first tranche of SDZs for residential development shortly.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the allocation of tax exemptions lies with my colleague, the Minister for Finance. I understand however, that receipt of a payment from my Department would not affect an individual's right to claim the £6,000 tax exemption. Regarding the assessment of such income for social welfare purposes, the various weekly social welfare payments can be broadly divided into two main categories &ndash; social insurance payments and means-tested social assistance payments. As social insurance payments are not subject to a means test, any income a claimant may have, including income from renting out a room, would not affect their entitlement to payment. In the case of the social assistance payments, the situation differs between payments. In the case of the old age and widow-er's, non-contributory, pension schemes, any income received in respect of rent from a person who lives with the pensioner is disregarded for means test purposes where, apart from that person, the pensioner lives alone. In the case of an old age pensioner couple, only half of any income which they have is assessed for means test purposes.</P>
      <P>In the case of the carer's allowance scheme a single claimant can have weekly income of up to £125 disregarded for means test purposes, while a couple can have up to £250 disregarded. Any further changes in the means-testing arrangements in relation to the assessment of rental income for those claimants not covered by the above disregards would have cost implications and would therefore, have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The necessary legal process transferring ownership of the property to my Department is being undertaken.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department has facilitated public access to the gardens during the main visitor season, i.e. April to September, over the past two years. The plan this year was to open the gardens to the public on weekdays and to pre-booked coach tours at weekends. However this plan has been delayed by the foot and mouth precautions as access is through a working farm there with susceptible animals, which is run by a private tenant. My Department is most anxious to open the gardens to the public as soon as possible and is currently preparing a plan to fence off the cattle from possible contact with visitors. The Department will be seeking the agreement of the farmer to this plan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>A programme of works has already been undertaken in relation to visitor access to the gardens and preliminary surveys have been carried out with regard to the house and outbuildings. Given the fact that State ownership has not yet been finalised and that major refurbishment works would require substantial capital funding, I am not in a position to indicate either the extent or timing of works that may be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended meetings with the following on 11 May while on an official visit to Erris, County Mayo: Comharchumann Ionad Deirbhile Teoranta; Selc Éire Teoranta; Glancré Teoranta; Tasc Fórsa Béal a Mhuiread; and Ex-employees of Warners Teoranta.</P>
      <P>The report of the Belmullet Task Force has made recommendations regarding employment, infrastructure, training and education, tourism and language needs for the Erris region, both Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht. Allowing for inflation total funding of approximately £60 million will be required to implement these recommendations. Of this amount, about £25 million will be provided from the existing funding commitments of various bodies leaving the necessity for special funding of about £35 million which over a six-year period amounts to about £5.8 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development, along with me as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, the Minister for the Marine <Col N="1037" /> and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, and Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, have been asked to co-ordinate efforts to source the extra funding of £35 million as speedily as possible. I, along with my colleagues, am fully committed to the full implementation of the report's recommendations over a six year period and we are confident this will be achieved. My involvement will be with the recommendations relating to the Gaeltacht in so far as they impact on my Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív will have the general co-ordinating role otherwise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendations of the report relating to my Department and Údarás na Gaeltachta the following is the position: An tÚdarás does not break down its annual expenditure budget by region and accordingly it is not possible to indicate the funds that will be expended on projects in the Erris area in 2001 and 2002; and as part of the measures proposed by an tÚdarás in the short-term a provision of £1 million has been approved for the refurbishment of part of the premises previously occupied by Warners, Éire, Teoranta as an advance telecommunications unit.</P>
    <P>The following expenditure has been sanctioned to date in 2001 under improvement schemes in the Gaeltacht for the Erris Gaeltacht:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Strategic Gaeltacht Roads</i>R313 Belmullet-Blacksod: £0.25 million</P>
    <P>L1203 (R314) Belmullet-Carratigue: £0.25 million</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that for the duration of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 some £0.5 million per year will be spent by my Department in respect of the improvement of these strategic roads.</P>
    <P>Accommodation Roads-Bog Roads-Village Renewal Projects: £88,750.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the same level of funding approximately will be available in 2002 and in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Strategic Gaeltacht Piers</i>My Department, in consultation with Mayo County Council and the other relevant County Councils, is currently in the process of identifying a number of strategic Gaeltacht piers which it is hoped will be developed during the duration of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. In this context consultants have been appointed by Mayo County Council to undertake feasibility studies, etc., on Blacksod and Porturlin piers. When the results of these feasibility studies are available the question of the provision of funding for the development of these piers will be considered further.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small Piers</i>A programme of minor marine works to small piers in Gaeltacht areas &ndash;  including piers in the Iorras area &ndash; which commenced in 1998, in partnership with the relevant local authorities, will continue this year and in subsequent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, given that the courts are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to intervene in or comment on sentences imposed by them.</P>
      <P>I am however, concerned to ensure that adequate sentences are available under the law to deter drug trafficking. In this regard, I have provided in section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, for the creation of a new offence related to the possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more for the purpose of sale or supply. Section 5 provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment as well as for a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. According to section 5, a court should not apply the mandatory minimum sentence where it is satisfied that there are exceptional and specific circumstances which would make it unjust in all the circumstances to impose the minimum 10 years sentence. Factors to which the court may have regard include whether the person pleaded guilty, taking account of the stage at which such an intention was indicated and the circumstances surrounding the indication, and whether the person materially assisted the investigation of the offence.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Act is being kept under review.</P>
      <P>Our legal system generally provides for the imposition of maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law permits the judge to exercise his or her discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he-she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. It is important to mention the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, which provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the court for a review of what appears to the Director, to be an unduly lenient sentence.</P>
      <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. The report of the Commission illustrated a number of differences of opinion among members in relation to some of the recommendations in the report, which highlights the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Courts and Courts Officers Act, 1995, enables me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to provide funds for judicial train<Col N="1039" /> ing courses arranged by the judiciary. Some £250,000 has been made available, during 2001, to the Judicial Studies Institute which was established by the Chief Justice for the purpose of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the Institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, provides for meetings of District Court Judges to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar provision in the case of other Courts, I understand that they hold similar meetings.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics, December, 2000, recommended that a Judicial Council be established on a statutory basis, within which, the Judicial Studies Committee should undertake responsibility for the establishment of a sentencing information system similar to that in existence in New South Wales, Australia.</P>

Following these enquiries the builder undertook in February 2001 to complete work on the complainants' house as soon as he had completed another job. I understand the complainants declined at the time of the initial complaint to make a written statement to the Garda.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that in March 2001 the complainants made further representations stating that the work had not yet been completed. The complainants were revisited by the Garda and have now made a written statement. I understand the statement is being examined with a view to establishing whether any breaches of Criminal Law have occurred.</P>

      <P>Agreement in principle has been reached to amalgamate the two schools in County Kildare referred to by the Deputy. An analysis of the existing accommodation at the schools has been undertaken. The schedules of residual accommodation and suggested future use of existing accommodation have been prepared and copies forwarded to the respective school authorities for their acceptance and observations. As soon as a response is received from the schools' authorities and subject to their acceptance of the schedules of accommodation the question of the appointment of a design team for the project will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, was increased in 2000 to approxi<Col N="1045" /> mately £12.2 million, and will be further increased this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>At second level, in addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school, under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this additional annual funding is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment, CE, schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that, as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>

      <P>Since this Government came into office, <Col N="1049" /> there has been an unprecedented increase in dedicated funding for research available to third level institutions. The first dedicated block of funding, £5 million, was introduced in 1998. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the Government is providing £550 million to support research, technological development and innovation in the third level sector. The aim is to support the development of a world class research environment in higher education in Ireland through four sub-measures designed to help to improve the research skills and capacity of third level institutions; raise the quality of teaching and learning activities in the institutions; increase the availability of highly skilled researchers in the labour force; provide greater scope for collaboration between education and other sectors of the economy in respect of research.</P>
      <P>Research is also funded as part of the annual core grant to the universities, which has increased by more than 20% from £165 million in 1997 to £207 million in 2000. In addition, universities may apply for research funding under other areas of the National Development Plan including the £560 million Technology Foresight Initiative.</P>
      <P>I recognise that third level institutions have a vital role to play in supporting the activities of the private sector through commercial research. However, I am satisfied that the significantly increased level of support available from the State for research in third level institutions outlined above means that universities are not unduly reliant on research funding from commercial interests.</P>

      <P>At primary level, teachers are class teachers rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy the Department of Education and Science that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, teachers trained in another member state of the European Union, including teachers from the UK, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by the Department of Education and Science, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are <Col N="1050" /> granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period of provisional recognition these teachers are remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers. The period of provisional recognition has recently been extended from three to five years in order to allow such teachers adequate time to prepare for and pass the Irish language examination and also in response to the current teacher supply issue at primary level.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, teachers trained outside of the European Union, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department, are now also being granted a five year period of provisional recognition to allow them to teach in mainstream classes in primary schools. This change has been effected from 1 September of this year, in view of the current shortage of qualified primary teachers, and will apply until September 2002, at which stage it will be reviewed. In common with EU trained teachers, non EU teachers will be required to work towards achieving the Irish language qualification during their period of provisional recognition. Non EU trained teachers will be remunerated in the same manner as fully qualified teachers during their period of provisional recognition.</P>
    <P>In addition, a number of changes have been made to the Irish qualification examination, aimed at assisting teachers trained outside the State to obtain the Irish language qualification. The most important of these is the extension of the period of provisional recognition from three to five years. As the examination is held twice a year, candidates will have at least ten opportunities to sit the examination during their period of provisional recognition; the examination now comprises four individual modules and teachers can prepare for and sit different modules at different times.</P>
    <P>Teachers who pass an individual module will be exempt from that module for a period of five years; courses are being provided, through the Education Centre Network, to facilitate teachers preparing for the examination.</P>
    <P>The number of applicants from the UK who sought recognition as primary teachers in this country between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2000 was approximately 670.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 213, 214 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 children are currently enrolled in the CABAS facility in Cork. My Department has agreed to fund an expansion of this facility to cater for up to 12 additional children. Efforts to arrange suitable accommodation for this expansion are continuing on an urgent basis. I am hopeful that the necessary accommodation will be in place early in the new school year.</P>
      <P>I understand that applications for admission to the CABAS facility have been made in respect of a further 27 children. I understand that the parents of a number of these children are also considering alternative placements for their children. Legal actions have been initiated in respect of ten of the children. These actions are at various stages in the legal process. A number of the children in question will be accommodated through the proposed expansion of the CABAS facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last five years, 36 cases involving children with autism have been settled or adjourned generally on the basis that appropriate provision has been put in place for the individuals concerned. There are currently 42 cases listed before the High Court relating to actions taken by parents or guardians of individuals who have been diagnosed as autistic. The total amount of agreed damages-settlements and legal costs paid in respect of cases settled over the period in question is as follows.<Col N="1052" /></P>

    <P>One High Court decision involving an individual diagnosed with autism has been appealed to the Supreme Court. The outcome of that appeal is awaited.</P>
    <P>The CABAS facility to which the Deputy refers was established in 1998 as a five year pilot programme to test the appropriateness and effectiveness of the CABAS approach to the education of children with autism.</P>
    <P>My Department has commissioned the UK based National Foundation for Educational Research to carry out an independent evaluation of all current State funded models of response to children with autism, including the CABAS model and other models based on the applied behavioural analysis approach. The foundation has now commenced its work and will be in contact with the facilities in question over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I have also established a special task force to review the adequacy of the current range of educational responses to children with autism, including responses based on the applied behavioural analysis approach and to make recommendations on the future development of services for the children in question. I expect to receive the report of the task force in June of this year.</P>
    <P>A further key development in this regard is the recent report of the planning group established to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of the education system for students with disabilities, including students with autism. The recommendations brought forward by the planning group provide a valuable blueprint for the development of an effective special education service which will remove the need for parents to have to resort to litigation to secure their entitlements. It is my intention to seek Government approval to proceed with these measures shortly.</P>
