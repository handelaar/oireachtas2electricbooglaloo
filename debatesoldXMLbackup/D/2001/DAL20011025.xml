      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic I received notice from Deputies Seán Ryan, Sargent and Jim Higgins. I call Deputy Seán Ryan to state the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I seek to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the urgent need of the Government to reconsider its plans for the privatisation of a 35% share in Aer Lingus, the out-sourcing of many areas of its business, the planned redundancy of more than 2,000 workers and the need for Government and management to enter into negotiations with the unions with a view to securing agreement on a common approach to save the <Col N="2" /> company and protect the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to respond in a constructive way to the many concerns raised by workers in Aer Lingus so that plans to out-source various and often profitable aspects of the company may be dropped to retain the maximum number of employees in the restructured company and moves to privatise may be abandoned as no mandate from the people of Ireland has been given for any such move.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter requiring urgent consideration, namely, the decision by the Government to fully support the axing of 2,026 jobs at Aer Lingus, the ongoing failure of the Government to exploit EU directives to assist the survival of the airline and the decision by the Government to sell off 35% of the national carrier.</P>

      <P>In regard to the second topic, I have received notice from Deputy Healy. I now call on Deputy Healy to state the matter.</P>

      <P>I seek leave under Standing Order 31 to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the call by Concern, the relief organisation, for a military cessation from all sides in the Afghanistan conflict to allow for the opening of road and air corridors so that food can be delivered and stockpiled before the onset of winter in order to prevent a humanitarian disaster.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 24, motion re Dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), returned from committee; No. 25, motion re Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam (proposal for a Council regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third country national) returned from committee; No. 7, Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 1, Sustainable Energy Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: Nos. 24 and 25 shall be decided without debate and the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 November 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 24 and 25 without debate agreed? These are motions about the approval to dispatch a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to Ethiopia and Eritrea and the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Is that proposal agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the Adjournment of the Dáil today agreed? Agreed. I shall now take Leaders' questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before putting a question to the Tánaiste I would like the House to note the passing of Eamon Kelly, actor and storyteller, and I would like to extend our sympathy to his wife, Maura, and his family. The high point of his career was when he was nominated for a Tony award after appearing in the staring role in <i>Philadelphia Here I Come</i> on Broadway. John B. Keane said of him: &ldquo;He can take a word or a phrase and swing it in front of you like a hypnotist's pendulum so that he captivates you. It's a magician's art.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In her capacity as Minister of one of the key economic Departments with a specific role in employment policy, will the Tánaiste indicate what the early warning system in her Department is telling her about the likely impact of the economic slow down on the level of employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the leader of the Fine Gael and send the condolences of the Labour Party to the wife and family of the late Eamonn Kelly, a person who was quintessentially Irish and who embodied everything that was good about traditional Irish life.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste indicate the specific monitoring systems that exist within her Department to identify companies currently at risk in light of today's report that up to 14,000 IDA Ireland sponsored jobs are vulnerable? Does she accept that a co-ordinated mechanism of assisting companies at risk is more valuable at present than encouraging outside companies to invest in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputies Noonan and Howlin in extending my sympathy and that of the Government to the wife, Maura, and family of the late Eamonn Kelly. Mr. Kelly was an outstanding Irishman who entertained us all. I was not aware of the comments by John B. Keane quoted by Deputy Noonan but they are apt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The global economic slowdown had been under way prior to the events of 11 September, although clearly these compounded its effects, and Ireland had already lost approximately 4,000 jobs in the high-tech sector this year. To put that in context, globally 500,000 jobs were lost in the <Col N="5" /> sector and 200,000 of these losses came in the United States. During the summer period in particular a number of announcements were made with regard to job losses.</P>
    <P>The industrial development division of my Department has an early warning system in place. It is constantly in contact with the relevant State agencies &ndash; Shannon Development, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; which are in direct contact with their clients. Relatively speaking, we have in place as good an early warning system as possible. I am conscious that, on foot of commercial, stock exchange and other considerations, companies make decisions rapidly. These are not always communicated to us and, for understandable reasons, they cannot be. I do not have responsibility for the food or tourism sectors. In the aftermath of 11 September, tourism in particular will take a heavy hit in the short term.</P>
    <P>I wish to reassure the House by stating that unemployment remains low at 3.6%. The number of applications for job permits is still running at approximately 200 per week. We have had a very liberal regime in place in relation to work permit applications where 95% to 99% of these were granted. Obviously we must be vigilant in light of the possibility that unemployment might rise and we must adopt a somewhat more conservative approach to granting work permit applications. We must be sure companies cannot find workers from the indigenous population before employing foreign nationals, because our first priority is to employ our own people. There are 60,000 foreign nationals working in Ireland. More than half of these are from outside the EEA and require work permits or working visas, while the remainder are from within the EEA. It is clear that a safety valve exists in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the high-tech sector is undergoing its most difficult period in 40 years. A number of different factors have arisen in recent months which have caused this, but it will remain a strong sector in Ireland where it employs more than 100,000 people. It is clear this is an industry for the future and not one that will collapse. Ireland will be a key player in this sector and that is why it is important that we remain competitive and deal with the issues which affect the competitiveness of our economy. The Government is vigilant in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I return to whether the early warning system in the Tánaiste's Department is adequate. At present, sentiment among ordinary people is turning and there is a danger that we might talk ourselves into a deeper recession than economic circumstances will justify. Against a background of farming being in crisis, the tourism industry being in meltdown, Aer Lingus being on the brink of disaster, the value of property being in decline, the IT sector being in great difficulty and building contractors laying off workers and signalling that they will no longer build on speculation and will only work to meet demand, the Tánaiste has a duty to put figures on the decline <Col N="6" /> in sentiment in order that her early warning system can assure the public that we are not on the slippery slope towards recession. She must do so. I am optimistic about the economy, but sentiment has turned. A great deal of the growth experienced in Ireland in recent years depended on consumer spending and consumer confidence. The latter is leaking out of the economy at present.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance must make statements at the earliest opportunity about the current state of the economy and the prospects towards the end of the year. IDA Ireland is quoted this morning as suggesting that 14,000 jobs in the high-tech sector will disappear in the coming 12 months. Has that data been factored into the Department's early warning system, from where did it come and is it correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not helpful to refer to disasters and meltdown. The glass is still half full and it is important to remember that. The Australians are celebrating the fact that this year their growth figure will reach 4%. Notwithstanding the global difficulties, the Irish growth rate will be in excess of 5%. We must, therefore, put matters in context. Ireland still has one of the fastest growing and most successful economies in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said earlier in the week that the growth rate would be 3%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a forecast possibly for next year. I am referring to the figure for 2001. In that context, things have clearly changed during the past 12 months. We must be responsible and cautious and we cannot engage in any spendthrift policies and return to some of the policies that caused problems in the past. We have factored in to our early warning system the forecast from IDA Ireland which indicated that, this year, there would probably be a net increase of only 400 jobs in the FDI sector as opposed to increases of between 10,000 to 12,000 in recent years.</P>
      <P>We must not forget the indigenous sector. Many Irish companies are focused on the United States and are experiencing considerable difficulties. There is considerable industrial development support for companies in Ireland by way of grant aid and a favourable taxation system. The education system and our training regime remain crucial in assisting companies to develop the kind of skills base they need to compete. I am confident we will see our way through this global economic slowdown and the Irish economy will emerge from it in good shape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste in a position to confirm that the board of Irish Rail has developed proposals to divest the company of the bulk of its freight business? Does she accept that such a proposal would be socially and environmentally disastrous for this country, that it runs counter to national and European Union policy and that it is in direct contravention of an EU <Col N="7" /> White Paper published in recent weeks? Will the Government intervene to ensure that this crazy plan is not implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that yesterday the board of CIE rejected proposals to the effect that of the 600 operatives in the freight sector, there should be 300 redundancies.</P>
      <P>Can the Tánaiste confirm this or indicate an alternative plan? Is it wise that CIE should adopt a strategy to move freight from rail to road when there is traffic chaos in our towns and cities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give an unconsidered response. I am not aware of whether the board has made the decision suggested by Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they tell the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not aware that such a decision has been made. I agree that both from an environmental perspective and from the traffic point of view we need to use our railways productively, effectively and efficiently. In relation to the board of CIE making decisions about redundancies, I am not aware of what decisions they may have made except that Irish State companies obviously have to be efficient and effective and must operate in the real world of the private sector. If the board of CIE made such a decision I am sure it was in the interests of the overall company that such a decision was made, regrettable as it might be that people have to lose their jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Noonan's question, the plan is to make sure Aer Lingus survives, succeeds and develops. That is the priority for the Government. Unfortunately from time to time companies in both the State and private sectors have to take tough decisions to survive in the medium to long term. The survival plan put forward by the board of management of CIE is with a view to ensuring the company becomes viable. Everyone wants to see the company becoming viable and the Government wants to see the plan implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste accept that it seems this Government has no handle at all on what is happening in any of the semi-State companies? She clearly has no knowledge or understanding of what is happening. Does she accept that the semi-States are being run into the ground by the absence of any vision or policy on them? Specifically in relation to the matter I raised, will the Government accept the abandonment by Irish Rail of the bulk of its freight services or will <Col N="8" /> the Tánaiste give an undertaking this morning that the Government will intervene to ensure this critical social and environmental network is maintained? The consequences for our totally inadequate road network of transferring tens of thousands of journeys from rail to road would be horrendous and unacceptable. Can we have clarity on that matter in terms of the view of the Tánaiste and the policy of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is not running the State sector into the ground. No Government has invested more in public transport than this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

      <P>Yesterday the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, announced to the press that he expected the Road Traffic Bill to go through the Dáil before Christmas. The Bill has not yet reached Second Stage here and I understand <Col N="11" /> from my Whip that there is only one slot reserved for it between now and Christmas. What revised arrangements is the Government making to have the Second Stage of the Road Traffic Bill in the Dáil and at what point does the Tánaiste expect the Second Stage to be completed so that it can go to committee? Certainly the Labour Party would like to facilitate the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in having this Bill passed through all Stages in the Dáil by Christmas but we want to hear now what is the Government's timetable to enable that to happen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for constitutional and legislative reform in relation to the protection of <Col N="20" /> human life in pregnancy. This proposal, which represents the first legislative response to the legal issues which remain unresolved since the X case in 1992, represents a fair, reasonable and compassionate approach.</P>
    <P>Abortion is a sensitive issue for society and it is heartening that the response to the proposals to date has been of a measured, mature and thoughtful nature without, thankfully, the rancour that characterised the debates in 1983 and 1992.</P>
    <P>It is very important to acknowledge that laws alone cannot deal adequately with the often tragic realities of crisis pregnancy in modern society. On more than 6,500 occasions in the past year alone, women giving an Irish address have had abortions in Britain. That is about 18 women every single day of the year and many Irish women have made this journey in previous years also. The difficult situations faced by these women and the often lonely decisions they have made demand a sensitive, understanding and compassionate response from us all.</P>
    <P>We must, by every reasonable means at our disposal, strive to reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy. Law is only part of the picture. Education, advice, care and compassion are in many ways much more important. That is why a comprehensive approach is being adopted on three different levels: constitutional, legislative and caring, practical, intervention.</P>
    <P>I accept that the proposals to address the constitutional and legislative issues will have little, if any, impact on the situation of those Irish women who choose to travel abroad for abortions. I also acknowledge that a comprehensive range of compassionate, supportive and non-judgmental services is vital in order to provide women with the supports they need to deal with a crisis pregnancy and to make decisions about the options open to them. It is for these reasons that, having considered the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, I have established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency which will have the task, in consultation with Government and other statutory and non-statutory agencies, of drawing up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and oversee its implementation. I have appointed Ms Olive Braiden, who has a distinguished record in the fields of human rights and women's health issues, as chairperson of the agency and I am in the process of appointing the management board. Initial staff have already been seconded from my Department to enable the agency to become operational. The Government is providing funding of 6.5 million for the agency in 2002.</P>
    <P>The prevention of crisis pregnancy in the first instance will be a primary task of the agency. Preventative issues concerning education of young people and adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles, will be addressed. Much concern has been expressed about the need to make women more aware of their options should they have a crisis pregnancy, and to enable <Col N="21" /> them to consider these carefully and to assist them before they make decisions about the course of action they want to take. This is another major area to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Women who have had an abortion, either recently or some time ago, have particular needs also and this is another area which the agency will be asked to address. We need to ensure that they are treated with compassion and understanding and that both their emotional and physical health needs are attended to.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will play a major role in the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services. The Government hopes that over time it will be possible to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among Irish women and ensure that women who find themselves in this situation will have available to them the widest possible range of assistance to help them deal with their situation.</P>
    <P>I will now set out briefly the constitutional and legal background to the proposals in the Bill. In 1983 the people decided by referendum to insert into the Constitution Article 40.3.3, which declares:</P>
    <P>the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>No laws were ever enacted on foot of this amendment and the provisions in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 remained the basic law in relation to abortion. This left open the possibility that Article 40.3.3 would have to be interpreted by the courts as apart from the 1861 Act there was no legislation which made clear what was and was not permissible under the law should there be a potential conflict between the right to life of the mother and that of the unborn.</P>
    <P>As Members will be well aware, subsequent to the insertion of Article 40.3.3, cases have arisen in the course of which the substantive issue of abortion has been considered by the courts. The general circumstances of these cases will be well known to Members and do not require reiteration. In the X case of 1992, a majority of the members of the Supreme Court held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, and that this real and substantial risk could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination was lawful. The stated risk to the mother's life in this case arose because she had threatened to commit suicide if she had to continue with the pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Some of the <i>dicta </i>of the majority in the Supreme Court also indicated that the constitutional right to travel could be restrained to prevent an abortion taking place in circumstances where there was no threat to the life of the mother. The right to travel did not take pre<Col N="22" /> cedence over the right to life. In November 1992, constitutional amendments were proposed to deal with different aspects of the X case judgment. On the substantive issue, the wording put forward by the Government was intended to recognise that there could be circumstances where, in order to protect the life of a pregnant woman, medical intervention was necessary which could result in the death of the unborn child but that these circumstances did not include the risk of suicide. The people rejected this amendment.</P>
    <P>In the C case of 1997, the High Court accepted that where evidence had been given to the effect that the pregnant young woman involved might commit suicide unless allowed to terminate her pregnancy, there was a real and substantial risk to her life and such termination was, therefore, a permissible medical treatment of her condition where this was the only means of avoiding such a risk.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Geoghegan also made remarks <i>obiter dicta</i> about the issue of travel. He believed that a court, in considering the welfare of an Irish child in Ireland and considering whether on health grounds a termination of pregnancy was necessary, must be confined to considering the grounds for termination which would be lawful under the Irish Constitution and could not make a direction authorising travel to another jurisdiction for a different kind of abortion. The amended Constitution did not, he said, now confer a right to abortion outside of Ireland. It merely prevents injunctions against travelling for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There has been a view that, arising from the judgment in the X case and subsequently the C case, there is &ldquo;unfinished business&rdquo; requiring a response in terms of constitutional or legislative change, or both.</P>
    <P>In the light of the difficulties which have surrounded previous efforts to address the issues to which I have referred, the Government has devoted considerable effort to facilitating and informing public debate about them. The Bill I am bringing before the House today represents the latest step in this process. We have engaged in a careful and logical process designed to explore the issues, to enable the many people and organisations who wish to express their views on the protection of pregnant women and of unborn human life in pregnancy to be heard and to consider ways of moving forward which will, we hope, command the support of the people. While it may never be possible to satisfy every point of view or to devise a solution acceptable to all, the Government has sought, by fostering a reasonable, calm and structured national debate, to develop a consensus on how the issues arising from the X and C case judgments might finally be resolved.</P>
    <P>In the first instance the Government decided in 1997 that a Green Paper on abortion would be prepared. This document was published in September 1999 and was welcomed by many interests as a clear and balanced document, setting out as <Col N="23" /> it did the history of the issues and the different arguments advanced and discussing the principal constitutional and legislative options. The Government referred the Green Paper to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, for consideration. The all-party committee embarked on a detailed process of consultation, first seeking submissions on the options discussed in the Green Paper. Over 100,000 submissions were received from individuals and organisations. Subsequently, the committee held hearings at which the issues were explored in detail with many of those who had made submissions, including representatives of the medical profession and of the churches, attending. The all-party committee's proceedings and report, published in November 2000, were generally agreed to be fair, balanced and of great value in educating and forming public and political opinion.</P>
    <P>The Government has carefully examined the different proposals put forward by the all-party committee and the approach being adopted is based on one of the three possible approaches identified by the committee. Stated briefly, it will protect best medical practice while providing for a legislative prohibition on abortion and underpinning such legislation with an amendment to the Constitution. The Government is satisfied on the basis of all the expert medical evidence presented and discussed that there are life-threatening conditions or illnesses, either associated with pregnancy or exacerbated by pregnancy, in which in order to save the woman's life it may be necessary for doctors to consider taking action in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended. The Government does not believe that a risk of suicide is a valid basis on which to provide for medical intervention.</P>
    <P>The experience in the 1992 referendum attests to the difficulty of providing in a relatively short constitutional provision for a clear prohibition on abortion, while ensuring that there is no obstacle to pregnant women receiving all the care and treatment they need. The Government has concluded that there is no simple sentence or paragraph that can be inserted into the Constitution which, by itself, would amount to a balanced, effective, legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy. Instead the Government has decided that the proper place to strike that complex balance is in legislation, not in the Constitution. The proposals contained in the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act provide a practical legislative response to the issues raised by the 1983 amendment and by the &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo; cases. They will not satisfy the wishes of those at different ends of the spectrum. The proposals are aimed at achieving a reasonable compromise which will enjoy the support of the middle ground of opinion and, I hope, be seen by the other groups as an honest and genuine attempt to pro<Col N="24" /> vide an acceptable and workable solution to this complex issue.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that to do nothing in relation to abortion is still the best option. However, in the Government's view, the terms of Article 40.3.3 and the Courts' interpretation of that Article demand a legislative response from the Oireachtas. Indeed in 1992 one judge of the Supreme Court criticised the Oireachtas for its lack of action in this regard. At present the only real defence against widespread use of the X case as a basis for &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; in Ireland is the ethical consensus in the medical profession. It must be remembered, however, that those outside the medical profession are not subject to that ethical code and with, for example, the development of drugs which can bring about an abortion without medical intervention, the current protections afforded to the unborn cannot be regarded as adequate.</P>
    <P>Others have argued for legislation without further constitutional change or underpinning. However, the outcome of the X case does not afford a satisfactory starting point for future legislation. To legislate for the decision in the X case and, in particular, to make complex legal provision and control for the suicide risk as a ground for abortion, could open the way to freely available &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government, having considered all the options, is opposed to permitting any intervention which could or would result in the death of the unborn child other than where the mother's life is at risk from a medical condition, excluding a risk of suicide. I believe a majority of Irish people are opposed to any lessening of the protection currently afforded to the unborn and I have no doubt that any proposal to remove Article 40.3.3 from the Constitution, which would be necessary if it were proposed to legalise abortion, would fail.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill is to provide a secure and effective constitutional basis for a legislative approach to the protection of human life in pregnancy. The proposals are designed to ensure that women can continue to receive all necessary medical treatment during pregnancy, while at the same time ensuring maximum protection of the unborn and maintaining a clear prohibition on abortion.</P>
    <P>The mechanism proposed is that a referendum will be held to approve the insertion into Article 46 of the Constitution of the text of proposed amendments to Article 40.3 of the Constitution. These are (i) a new subsection 4º in Article 40.3 to provide that the life of the unborn in the womb will be protected in accordance with the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002; and (ii) a new subsection 5º in Article 40.3 to provide that any future proposal to amend or repeal the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002 will have to be approved by the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> If the people accept the proposal, the amendments to Article 40.3 will have effect only if a law containing the text of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act is enacted by the Oireachtas within a period of 180 days, otherwise the amendment in its entirety is nullified.</P>
    <P>The mechanism of making a constitutional amendment conditional on a later legal development was successfully used in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The proposed constitutional changes on this occasion are designed to ensure that the legislation has a sound constitutional basis, that the careful balance it strikes will not be subject to legal challenge from either side of the argument and to give people the reassurance that they will be consulted if change is proposed in the future.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that because Article 46.4 of the Constitution states that a proposal for a constitutional amendment shall not contain another proposal, the mechanism being used is not valid. Any such assertion is incorrect and is based on a misunderstanding of Article 46.4 of the Constitution. There is only one proposal in the Bill to amend the Constitution, namely, to insert into the Constitution the text set out in the First Schedule. The text of an envisaged criminal statute, as set out in the Second Schedule, is not a proposal within the meaning of Article 46.4 of the Constitution. The Bill to amend the Constitution does not propose that the Schedule containing the envisaged legislation should in itself have any legal effect. A &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Bill to amend the Constitution will give effect only to the constitutional amendments involved. The only way in which the terms of the legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy can become law or have any effect is through a separate, subsequent decision by the Oireachtas to enact another Bill.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because it is not possible to propose a criminal law and a constitutional law in the same Bill that the present amendment was drafted as it is. It was drafted deliberately to avoid containing two proposals, and it does not contain two proposals. The legislation, the text of which is set out in the Second Schedule, is not being enacted at this stage; all that people are voting for is to accommodate that legislation in the Constitution if the Oireachtas, at a later stage, passes it into law.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that the current proposal is in effect the same as that of 1992 and questions have been asked as to why it should be acceptable to the people now, when they rejected it in 1992. In 1992, the people voted on the proposed wording of the constitutional change itself, but not on the legislation which would have followed had the amendment been passed.</P>
    <P>On this occasion the Government is committed to allowing the people to decide not only on the principle but also on the detail of what is proposed. They have a right to be consulted on the fundamental issues involved in the abortion issue, <Col N="26" /> and the amendment process set out in this Bill recognises that fundamental right.</P>
    <P>The legislation envisaged has been published and will have been debated before the referendum so that the electorate know exactly what is proposed. The legislative mechanism, as I explained earlier, allows for a balanced, effective, legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround protection of human life in pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Such a complex balance can be struck in legislation in a way that is not possible if purely a constitutional approach were taken. At the same time, the constitutional &ldquo;lock&rdquo; which will be placed on the legislation guarantees that it cannot be altered by the Oireachtas without another referendum.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there has been a detailed process of examination of the issues and their complexities involving many submissions from interested parties and, in particular, the all-party committee's hearings during which many medical and other experts gave evidence. In many significant respects, therefore, what is proposed on this occasion represents a much more detailed approach following on from a careful process of consideration and debate.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the detail of the proposals. The Bill provides for the operation of a mechanism whereby proposed changes to Article 40.3 of the Constitution and the text of envisaged legislation on the protection of human life in pregnancy will be put to the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the amendment of Article 46 of the Constitution so that the text of the First Schedule to the Act will be inserted after the existing section 5 of that Article. Section 2 is a straightforward citation provision dealing with the proposed amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule contains the proposed text of the amendment of Article 46 of the Constitution. The proposed text to be inserted as Article 46.6.1 in turn contains the proposed text of Articles 40.3.4 and 40.3.5 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The text proposed as Article 40.3.4 provides that, in particular, the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002. The use of the term &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; makes it clear that the statute envisaged by the amendment, if enacted, is not intended to be a restatement or redefinition of the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; as used in Article 40.3.3.</P>
    <P>The effect of the text proposed as Article 40.3.5 is that any Bill containing provisions to amend the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, must be referred to the people in a further referendum. The existing Article 40.3.3, as amended in 1992, will remain also.</P>
    <P>The effect of the text proposed as Article 46.6.2 is that if the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, is enacted and amendments are made to Article 40, the amendments to Article 46 will no longer appear in the official text of the Constitution and the amendments made to <Col N="27" /> Article 40 will take effect, appearing in the appropriate place within that Article. This is because, once the amendments to Article 40.3 take place, it would be undesirable for the new Article 40.3 to appear in more than one place in the Constitution, that is, in Article 46 as was as in Article 40.</P>
    <P>The text proposed as Article 46.6.3 contains a mechanism whereby, unless within 180 days a law is enacted in exactly the terms of the text seen and approved by the people when they vote on the proposed amendment, the whole of Article 46.6 will cease to have effect and the Constitution will revert to the form in which it existed before the referendum. The text on which the people will vote will be that agreed by the Oireachtas in the course of the passage of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The fact that the text of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act is contained in a Schedule to the Bill does not curtail the right of the Oireachtas to discuss it and to propose amendments during the passage of the present Bill, in the same way as happens with any other legislation. It must be understood, however, that when following the referendum, the Oireachtas comes to enact the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, it will not be able to amend the Bill for that legislation in any way.</P>
    <P>The new law, when enacted by the Oireachtas, will not become a formal part of or be written into the Constitution. Its terms will simply have constitutional protection and recognition. It will be open to subsequent amendment like any law but only if the people approve the amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The text proposed as Article 46.6.4 states that the Bill for the law on the protection of human life in pregnancy is excluded from the terms of Articles 26 and 27 of the Constitution because if the people in a referendum decide that the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002, should be enacted, it would be inappropriate that this legislation should nonetheless later be subject to the provisions of these articles and the mechanisms they provide for reference of Bills to the Supreme Court and to the people respectively.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Bill contains the text of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act. Irish maternity services have a deservedly high reputation when it comes to both the care of pregnant women and their unborn children. The Government wants to put in place for the first time a legislative framework which will ensure that there are no legal doubts surrounding the provision of medial care during pregnancy.</P>
    <P>This Act will make clear what is and is not legally permissible by way of medical intervention during pregnancy. That is the first legislative approach in this area. The lives of women will be protected during pregnancy and the developing human life within the mother's womb will also be protected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> The Act will also remove any doubt there may be about the legality of treatment which doctors may consider necessary where some women during pregnancy are suffering from certain rare life-threatening medical conditions. It will provide certainty for doctors who may have feared that some interventions, although accepted medical practice in such situations, might nonetheless be unlawful.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines abortion for the purposes of the Act as &ldquo;the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman&rdquo;. It provides exemption from the definition of abortion of a medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved place, in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is terminated where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent the real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction.</P>
    <P>In the course of the hearing of medical evidence by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, it became clear that in a small number of cases of strict and undeniable medical necessity, intervention by doctors to safeguard the mother's life can entail or result in the ending of the life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>On reading the testimony to the all-party committee, it becomes apparent that while there are differences of language and of interpretation among members of the medical profession, their approach to the care of pregnant women and their unborn children is essentially the same, that is, their objective in all cases is to ensure that women receive all the medical care they may need and that the health of their unborn children is afforded the maximum protection also.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that in rare situations, in order to save a woman's life it may be necessary to intervene in a way that results in the death of the unborn child. These situations are very rare but they can and do occur. Dr. Peter McKenna, Master of the Rotunda Hospital, told the all-party committee that &ldquo;possibly once a year a woman would be seen in this country who, if her pregnancy is not terminated within a matter of probably hours or days, will die from a complication&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is also apparent from the evidence to the committee that many doctors would not consider that such a procedure constitutes abortion. Professor John Bonnar, Chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, stated:</P>
    <P>It would never cross an obstetrician's mind that intervening in a case of pre-eclampsia, cancer of the cervix or ectopic pregnancy is abortion. They are not abortion as far as the professional is concerned, these are medical treatments that are essential to protect the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The new law will, therefore, define &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; in a way that clearly excludes such ethically legitimate procedures from being termed an abortion for the purposes of our criminal law. Doctors may <Col N="29" /> provide any medical treatment which, in their opinion, is necessary to safeguard the life of a pregnant woman. The doctor's opinion must be formed in good faith and there is an explicit requirement that regard be had to the need to preserve unborn human life, where practicable. It is important to emphasise that doctors, when treating a pregnant woman, make every effort to safeguard not only her life, but that of her baby. This will not change after the passage of the Act.</P>
    <P>The question of threatened suicide in pregnancy is of concern to many people. Threatened suicide during pregnancy was a central issue in the X case and the C case, to which I have already referred. The effect of the proposed Act will be that a threat of suicide will no longer be a ground for legal abortion in the State. I know this is a difficult issue for many people and that there are those who believe it is appropriate and feasible to legislate to permit abortion where suicide is threatened. The suicide risk has only been advanced as a ground for abortion in cases where the State, in one way or another, directly or indirectly, was attempting to restrict the freedom of a woman to travel. The terms of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act will protect that freedom and will not compromise it in any way.</P>
    <P>The Government believes the evidence considered in the preparation of the Green Paper, and the testimony and conclusions in the report of the all-party committee, do not support the maintenance of suicide risk as a ground for abortion in Ireland and would not justify the enactment of a legal basis for abortion to avoid such a risk.</P>
    <P>Such studies as have been undertaken suggest that pregnancy has a &ldquo;protective effect&rdquo;. In a large UK study the rate of suicide in pregnancy was found to be only one-twentieth that of a similar matched non-pregnant population. Similar results have been demonstrated in other studies. It is important to exercise caution when interpreting the epidemiological data from other jurisdictions with different cultures and where legal abortion is available on a range of grounds, and the Government's view is not based solely on these studies.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the type of situation which will be covered by the Bill, it is very difficult to assess whether a risk of suicide is genuine. Evidence to the all-party committee suggests that it is very difficult to accurately predict suicide. Dr. John D. Sheehan, consultant in perinatal psychiatry at the Rotunda Hospital, indicated there is no test or fail-safe way of saying that a person will or will not commit suicide and that where suicide occurs it is due to the interaction of multiple factors, rather than just one. The evidence heard by the committee also indicates that the medical response to a pregnant woman considered to be at risk of committing suicide would be to help and support her and to treat her underlying mental condition. Providing for abortion where a woman's mental health may be at risk is one of the principal grounds on which abortion is permitted <Col N="30" /> in other countries and experience elsewhere strongly suggests that a change in the law to deal, on compassionate grounds, with a small number of exceptional cases can be exploited to allow wide scale application.</P>

      <P>To take England and Wales as an example, data from the Office for National Statistics (Abortion Statistics Annual Reference Volume) shows that, in the year 2000, more than 175,000 abortions were performed, and whereas 134 of these were performed because of a risk to the woman's life, more than 162,000, or 92%, were solely on the grounds of risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the woman. The Government is satisfied that, even though there is great public sympathy for the plight of women who find themselves with a crisis pregnancy, to provide for abortion where a woman in such a situation threatened suicide would not command widespread support and could, in effect, ultimately open the way to abortion on social grounds. The Government has therefore come to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the courts' judgments in the cases to which I have referred, on the available evidence, it would not be appropriate to legislate to permit abortion where, during pregnancy, a woman threatens suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prescribing of emergency contraception is an accepted part of medical practice for many doctors in Ireland, and has been for many years. In evidence to the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, Professor Gerard Bury, President of the Medical Council, said, &ldquo;It is currently a part of normal practice that hasn't been challenged or, in fact, even addressed within the ethical guidelines. It is seen as normal practice.&rdquo;  However the drug usually prescribed is an increased dose of the ordinary oral contraceptive pill, which is not licensed for use as emergency contraception. The all-party committee advocated in its report that any legal uncertainties that may exist in regard to the morning after pill should be removed. The Government accepts that this is unsatisfactory and that any doubts about the legality of drugs used as emergency contraception should be addressed. Under these proposals the use of emergency contraception, in the form of the morning after pill and the post-coital IUD, will not be prohibited. It is important to stress that the use of any drug to end an established pregnancy will be prohibited under the Act. Drugs are now available, and others may be developed in the future, which are intended to bring about an abortion, without surgical intervention. The licensing of such products in Ireland <Col N="31" /> would not be permissible under the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that the envisaged legislation will require the holding of a referendum if it is to be amended in any way, it is considered appropriate to provide a more flexible mechanism for the approval of certain hospitals for the purposes of the Act. It is therefore intended that arrangements will be put in place to enable a Minister of the Government, by order, to approve certain hospitals. The term &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; is intended to be applied to hospitals under responsible management and possessing adequate expertise in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology and in the treatment and prevention of life-threatening</P>
    <P>diseases arising out of or complicated by pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the prohibition of abortion within the State. The criminal offence of abortion is restated in clear, modern terms and the legal penalties are specified in terms which leave no doubt about the seriousness of the offence. The rebuttable provision regarding the presumption of the natural and probable consequences of a person's conduct replicates the ordinary provisions relating to criminal intent, as set out in the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, in respect of homicide. The purpose of this provision is to ensure a person who, for example, administered a drug or performed a medical procedure, the effect of which was to end unborn human life, would be presumed to have intended this outcome. He or she could, however, rebut that presumption by establishing, in a jury's mind, a reasonable doubt that he or she did not intend to end unborn human life, despite the fact that that was the natural and probable consequence of his or her actions.</P>
    <P>Contravention of the law in relation to abortion includes, as offences, attempted abortion and aiding, abetting, counselling or procurement of such abortion. The prohibitions encompass those currently contained in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which are repealed by section 6. Under existing legislation, any person, including the pregnant woman, who procures an abortion is liable, on conviction on indictment, to be sentenced to imprisonment for life or any lesser penalty. That is the current position, under existing legislation, and has been so for a very long time. This Bill differs from that and provides for a penalty of up to 12 years. I accept that some people have concerns about the potential criminalisation of a pregnant woman who procures her own abortion. In practice, of course, prosecutions against women in such a situation are extremely rare, if they have been taken at all for very many years.</P>

      <P>The requirement in section 2(4) that a prosecution may be brought only by, or with the consent of, the Director of Public Prosecutions ensures that frivolous or mischievous cases cannot be brought before the courts. The purpose of section 3 is to provide that a medical practitioner, or any other person, will not be obliged to carry out a procedure to which he or she has a conscientious objection, even though it may not constitute abortion under the Act. Given that the Act in effect simply provides legal protection for current medical practice, it is not expected that this provision will have any adverse effect on current practices.</P>
      <P>Section 4 deals with travel and information. The Act protects freedom to travel and the right to information in accordance with the existing provisions in the Constitution, approved by the people in 1992. It also makes clear that a court shall not restrict a person from travelling to another state on grounds that his or her conduct there would be an offence under this Act, were it to occur in Ireland. I have already referred to the issues about the right to travel in the context of the C case of 1997 and the Act will ensure there is no longer any doubt over a person's right to travel abroad. There is no question of a person's right to travel outside Ireland being interfered with in any way by the State, whatever his or her circumstances or reason for travelling.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the arrangements which apply to orders made under section 1 of the Act. The terms used are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes which might well occur in the future, such as a change in the title of a Minister in the Government. It is for this reason that the term &ldquo;a member of the Government&rdquo; is used, rather than the current title of a Minister. An order made under this section of the Act, in addition to designating specific hospitals as approved places for the purposes of section 1(2) of the Act, may deal with the making and keeping of records of medical procedures. This may include records of opinions and confirmation of records. Orders must be laid before the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House within a period of 21 sitting days. These arrangements enable orders to be changed where appropriate, for example allowing new hospitals to be designated, should this become necessary, without such a matter having to be the subject of an amendment of the Act, which would, of course, have to be approved in a referendum before it could have effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 repeals the current legislation prohibiting abortion, in the form of sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, <Col N="33" /> as these provisions are to be replaced by those contained in section 2 of this Act.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill represent a fair and reasonable attempt to resolve the constitutional and legal difficulties that have surrounded the issue of abortion since the judgment in the X case in 1992. They are also the culmination of a lengthy and detailed process of consultation and debate and the time has come to move on from this and attempt to resolve matters for the future.</P>
    <P>A pregnant woman should be entitled to whatever medical treatment she may need, even where this may unavoidably place the survival of her unborn child at risk. Any legal doubt about what is permissible in such cases must also be removed, so that doctors will be able to continue to provide the necessary treatment in accordance with established medical practice. The Irish health care system has an enviable reputation when it comes to the care of expectant mothers and their children and what is proposed in this Bill will protect current practice, not change it.</P>
    <P>For the reasons which I have described, a simple constitutional provision with no legislative backing would run a major risk of subsequently being interpreted by the courts in a manner not anticipated. Therefore, the means which the Government has chosen is the best way of ensuring that safeguards are put in place which spell out, in straightforward terms, what is and what is not allowed and which can be amended only if the people in a further referendum wish to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government believes this approach represents a reasonable view which will command the support of the middle ground of public opinion. It aims to be compassionate and realistic while also providing an honest response to the harsh realities faced by many women in this country. I am hopeful that this proposal will command general support as a prudent, workable, sensible, caring and compassionate approach to what is for everyone an emotive issue and, for some, the most important issue in their lives.</P>

      <P>To delete all the words after that and substitute:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, conscious of the need to approach with great care any proposals to incorporate the effects of detailed legislation into the Constitution, noting that Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann are being asked to pass legislation which will be open to interpretation by the courts but not amendment by the Oireachtas if the courts make an interpretation not envisaged by the Oireachtas or the people, noting that future amendments to the proposed legislation if passed will not be subject to the President's <Col N="34" /> right to refer such amending Bills to the Supreme Court, noting in particular the unprecedented proposal to allow a Minister, by order, vary the effect of a constitutional provision in relation to evidence to be retained as to whether a medical procedure or an abortion, both as defined in the Bill, had taken place and by order to determine and vary the approved places where such medical procedures may in future take place, defers the second reading of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, to enable the Government to present to Dáil Éireann satisfactory reasons for the mechanisms being proposed and their implications for the Oireachtas, the courts and the public interest and resolves accordingly that the Bill be read a Second Time this day three months.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to our motion will influence our vote on the Second Stage of this Bill if it is proceeded with at this time. Fine Gael made a constructive contribution to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and instigated the proposal for a compassionate, pro-active and adequately funded structure to meet the needs of women in crisis pregnancy. Our Care of Persons Board Bill, 2001, published last month is evidence of our real concern to reduce the number of abortions.</P>
    <P>There are three strands to this issue: the legislative and constitutional process; the Fine Gael Care of Persons Board Bill; and a structured approach by the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, other Departments, health boards and NGOs to promote education and prevention of unwanted pregnancy. Fine Gael's preferred approach is to separate the second and third strands. My comments today relate in the main to what I described as the first strand, following on the publication of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy) Bill, 2001.</P>
    <P>Over the summer, Fine Gael published a second Private Members' Bill, the Surgeon General Bill, 2001. Our objective is to create the Office of Surgeon General, which will work with the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. Fine Gael proposes that the Surgeon General should have the same relationship with the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children as the Comptroller and Auditor General has with the Committee of Public Accounts. The Surgeon General will independently report to the Oireachtas on the operation of the health services.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary and medical practitioners will have a role in applying the provisions of the twenty-fifth amendment if passed. The Oireachtas can remove members of the Judiciary for stated misbehaviour. The Oireachtas has no power over medical practitioners. A Surgeon General could report to the Oireachtas on any <Col N="35" /> health issue, including treatment during pregnancy. This would allow the Oireachtas to receive independent advice on the implementation of the amendment if passed and would provide a degree of transparency, which would inform public opinion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, Fine Gael continues to participate in the process by our amendment today as we did in the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. The process of developing national policy in this area commenced in 1979 and continued through the Green Paper in 1999 and the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in 2000. Fine Gael recognises that people have the right to seek to amend the Constitution and this is specifically provided for in article 6 of the Constitution, which reads: </P>
    <P>All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party has concerns about the Bill to which I will return later. We have scrutinised it with a view to considering the Government's proposal to put the matter to the people in a referendum. The Government's proposals, involving as they do an amendment to incorporate the effect of detailed legislation into the Constitution for the first time, need careful examination. For all we know there could be weaknesses in the proposals that we have not discovered on first reading. This is why the reading and Report Stages require careful attention on this occasion.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands, we have serious reservations. For example, any medical practitioner, even one just out of training, could decide to carry out the medical procedure referred to in section 1(2). Senior physicians have already questioned this provision. By contrast a lawyer cannot even decide a minor court case until he or she has the ten year post-qualification requirements to become a judge. Incidentally the wording does not refer to a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>In 1983, a short amendment to the Constitution seemed to be watertight. On the first challenge and to the surprise of those who proposed and supported the amendment, the Supreme Court ruling in the X case showed this not to be the case. The Government now effectively proposes a much longer amendment and this may even widen the scope for interpretation by the Supreme Court. For example, in article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>This is believed by those who supported the <Col N="36" /> 1983 amendment and others to apply from conception. Section 1(1) of the Bill, which if passed will be added as article 40.3.4º of the Constitution, seeks to protect unborn human life after implantation in the womb, but implantation is not defined. Conception is not mentioned anywhere in article 40.3.3º and a future Supreme Court could, for example, take the whole of the article as amended into account. Whether this could reduce protection to the unborn between conception and implantation is not clear. We note that the State must defend and vindicate the lives of the unborn under article 40.3.3º. Under article 40.3.4º as proposed, effectively the life of the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the Protection of Human Life and Pregnancy Act, 2002. The words &ldquo;defend and vindicate&rdquo; seem stronger than &ldquo;protect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Aside from the scope for interpretation which the Supreme Court may have it appears that the Medical Council has latitude in relation to changing ethical guidelines and that these can change with relative ease and behind closed doors as happened over the summer. The Medical Council ethical guidelines use the words &ldquo;where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother&rdquo;. This is slightly different from those being proposed in the constitutional amendment. Under the Government's proposals a designated Minister would be allowed to authorise approved places where medical procedures would be carried out. It is proposed to give a Minister power to do this by order. An order could be narrow and name only one or two places, or wide and name any doctor's surgery. It could also be varied. Similarly by order, a Minister would have power to vary the type of records a medical practitioner would have to keep as evidence of a medical procedure under section 1(2) as distinct from an abortion under section 1(1). This power could be used on the one hand to blur the distinction between a medical procedure and an abortion. On the other hand, it could be used to require such detailed records to be kept that no medical practitioner would feel safe carrying out such a procedure for fear of prosecution. A minority party or even Independent Deputies could, for example, make demands either way as part of the price for supporting a Government in office. Thus, a small minority could effectively set aside the wishes of the people. That a Minister would have power to vary the effect of a constitutional amendment is without precedent and, at best, is questionable.</P>
    <P>Section 2(3) provides that the penalty for carrying out an abortion as defined could range from a fine, which is unspecified, to 12 years imprisonment. This would be entirely at the discretion of the Judiciary. A future Judiciary might view abortion in such a light that only nominal fines would be applied, thereby rendering restraint on criminal abortion ineffective.</P>
    <P>A human embryo is the new organism which comes into existence at fertilisation. This organ<Col N="37" /> ism is not simply a collection of cells but, to quote the Australian Senate 1986 select committee considering human embryo experimentation in Australia, &ldquo;is oriented towards further development&rdquo;. A European People's Party document, Union of Value, presented to the EPP congress at Berlin in January 2001, stated, &ldquo;Distinctions between human person and person, or between the embryo as a potential human being cannot be made without introducing an unacceptable kind of discrimination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This issue needs to be considered in the light of what is contained in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and what is proposed to be given constitutional effect in Article 40.3.4º, if passed. The job of the Opposition is to treat legislation with the consideration it deserves, to point to its weaknesses and to seek to improve it. This is especially true where legislation is to be given constitutional status, perhaps for all time. The content of an amendment of the Constitution Bill which is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas will determine our attitude to the subsequent referendum campaign. We do not understand why a press conference was hurriedly and unexpectedly called to launch these proposals and we do not intend to be rushed in our consideration of the important contents of this Bill. The Second Schedule provides that the Short Title of the Act may read &ldquo;Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002.&rdquo;  This means the legislation is not to be enacted until next year and it gives time for detailed consideration of these proposals. We should use it to reflect on what are life and death issues.</P>
    <P>In 1979, the Oireachtas passed the Health (Family Planning) Act, which incorporated into law the provisions of the British Offences Against the Person, 1861, which made it illegal to procure a miscarriage. Until then the 1861 Act had been the law on abortion. In 1983, the proposal contained in the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was passed by referendum and this was inserted as Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. In 1986, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, SPUC, successfully obtained an injunction restraining the Dublin Well Woman Centre and Open Door Counselling from providing information which encouraged or facilitated abortion. This decision was upheld in 1988 by the Supreme Court when it was established that this restraint extended to the provision of addresses and telephone numbers. In 1992, the Dublin Well Woman Centre and Open Door Counselling took the matter to the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds that the Supreme Court decision breached the right to freedom of expression. The Strasbourg court ruled in their favour.</P>
    <P>In the same year the Supreme Court ruled that a 14 year old girl, pregnant as a result of rape and who was considered to be suicidal, had the right to travel outside the State for an abortion because of the real and substantial threat to her life. This became known as the X case. The judgment also <Col N="38" /> suggested that had she not been suicidal her right to travel for an abortion might be restricted. As a result of this and following on much public debate, three further amendments to the Constitution were proposed in 1992, which sought first, to clarify the law on what was meant by a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother, second, to deal with the right to travel and, third, to deal with the right to information.</P>
    <P>The wording of the proposed amendment to deal with what was meant by a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother stated, &ldquo;It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self destruction.&rdquo;  This was opposed by both sides of the debate and was defeated. The other two amendments were passed and are now incorporated in Article 40.3.3º. Legislation was introduced in 1995, which dealt with how information would be provided.</P>
    <P>In 1997, the High Court ruled that a 13 year old girl, pregnant as a result of rape in the care of a health board, could be taken out of the State for an abortion by the board even though this course was opposed by her parents. The judgment was never appealed. In 1999, the Green Paper on Abortion was published by the Government and in 2000 the All-Party Committee on the Constitution published its report, which has been considered by a Cabinet sub-committee. This summer Fine Gael published two Bills, to which I have referred, and in recent months the Medical Council changed its medical guidelines.</P>
    <P>This series of events illustrates that the issues involved can become very technical. They have given rise to court cases, both here and at the European Court of Justice. They have been interpreted in a way not envisaged by this House or the people. We should not take a solely legalistic approach to this. The number of legal aspects involved has meant we have not given due regard to the wider issues and to those who are vulnerable. That is why last September, I launched the Care of Persons Board Bill on behalf of Fine Gael. I said then that women experiencing crisis pregnancy need to be supported by the State and that for too long the State has failed to put in place proper support structures to assist them, leaving such work to excellent but over-stretched and under resourced voluntary organisations. Fine Gael supports the establishment of such support structures through the Bill. We envisage that the role of the board would be to support and facilitate any expectant mother experiencing a crisis pregnancy to bring her pregnancy to full term.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in Ireland to seek comprehensive solutions and to take no action until we have a magic formula. We should have considered separating the issues in the way I have suggested because some give rise to the need for <Col N="39" /> accommodation and such like while others give rise to the need for sexual education and prevention. They are not necessarily best grouped into the same agency, although I acknowledge that the agency that has been established, which Fine Gael first proposed, is an improvement.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate to date has centred on the argument for or against further constitutional amendment. Fine Gael played its part in the Oireachtas all-party committee on abortion. It was our proposal in the committee's report that led to recommendation for the establishment of an entity to support women in crisis pregnancy and their unborn. It is in that area that we will do most to reduce the rate of pregnancy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas all-party committee report noted that nobody knows the exact numbers of Irish women having abortions outside the State but it is clear that a significant number do. According to the report of the committee, the statistics supplied by the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales show that in 1971, 578 women &ldquo;normally resident in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; had abortions, while in 1999 the figure was estimated at 6,226.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas all-party committee report contained a section headed, Themes related to an Abortion Decision, and included a record of interviews which set out the reasons given for having an abortion. Career or job related concerns were given as the reason by 36 people. The stigma of lone parenthood was cited by 30. The number quoting needs of the child was 30 while the figure quoting financial unreadiness was 28. Twenty-seven quoted unreadiness for a child and 24 the inability to cope. Being too young was the reason given by 22. Nineteen already had a child and 17 said it was their body and their right. Education and training was cited by 14, ten never wanted a child, seven gave as their reason the stigma on parents, six said there was no way they could have a child at this time and four said they were too old.</P>
    <P>More than one third of those interviewed cited stigma, financial unreadiness and the inability to cope as their reasons. That is why we have to put huge amounts of our energy, effort and resources into helping women and their extended families during crisis pregnancies. If we were serious about the issue that is what we would do. Some women may choose abortion because they find themselves in a crisis and feel helpless and unsupported. In many cases they may feel they have nowhere to turn. We have already had a Green Paper and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution agreed that a major problem facing Ireland is the large number of crisis pregnancies resulting in recourse to abortion facilities available in Great Britain. It also spoke of the urgent need to adopt measures to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and that women in such pregnancies must be offered a real and positive alter<Col N="40" /> native to abortion. It said there is an urgent need to reduce the rate of abortion.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to the House that whatever happens to this Bill, whether it is passed here or endorsed by the people, we are not going to deal with this issue unless we commit wholeheartedly to assisting those in crisis pregnancies, to prevention of such pregnancies and to education. That is where we have to concentrate our efforts. Our Bill contains specific proposals to address aspects of this issue about which we are very concerned. The Minister has already outlined what the Bill will contain if it is amended. I will not repeat that, but I do need to raise some concerns which I will return to on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule of the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, repeals sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. Section 1(1) defines abortion as &ldquo;the intentional destruction by any means of unborn human life after implantation in the womb of a woman&rdquo;. People have various interpretations, but that is the one described in the Bill. Section 1(2) states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section, abortion does not involve the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which the unborn human life is ended where the procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about this. That would be described by any medical dictionary as abortion. It has not been described as abortion in this case. It is described as a &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; and is being permitted. We need to know exactly what the proposal is. The &ldquo;approved place&rdquo; is to be decided by ministerial order. &ldquo;Medical practitioner&rdquo; means a person permitted by law to practice as a medical practitioner in the State. &ldquo;Reasonable opinion&rdquo; means a reasonable opinion formed in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life where practicable and of which a written record has been made and signed by the practitioner. &ldquo;Woman&rdquo; means a female person. However, &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; is not defined. Why is that? Perhaps the Minister will tell us when he replies. Section 1(2) differentiates between &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; so why is it not defined along with the other definitions? The Bill even defines what a &ldquo;woman&rdquo; is.</P>
    <P>Section 2 prohibits the carrying out of abortions in the State, though this is confined to &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; as defined in section 1(1). This section also provides for imprisonment for up to 12 years or a fine, or both, for a person who attempts to carry out an abortion or who aids, abets, counsels or procures any person to do so. Section 3 provides that &ldquo;nothing in the Act should be con<Col N="41" /> strued as obliging any person to carry out any medical procedure referred to in <i>section 1</i> of this Act&rdquo;. It allows for conscientious objection. Section 4 deals with travel and information but section 5 provides that an authorised member of the Government may make orders relating to &ldquo;the making, keeping and confirmation of records (including records of opinion) of medical procedures referred to in <i>section 1</i> of this Act as may be considered by the member of the Government concerned necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. It provides that an order may be amended or revoked by order.</P>
    <P>Section 5(4) states:</P>
    <P>An order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is of central importance in determining whether a medical procedure which terminates unborn human life is &ldquo;in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life&rdquo;. &ldquo;Reasonable opinion&rdquo; means a reasonable opinion formed in good faith and of which a written record has been made and signed by the practitioner. This section requires careful consideration. It could, as currently drafted, give rise to a blurring of the distinction between &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; as defined by section 1(1) and a &ldquo;medical procedure&rdquo; as set out in section 1(2). Some future Minister might require only a perfunctory written record to be kept by a practitioner or require such detailed records to be kept that a medical practitioner would shy away from medical procedures for fear of committing a criminal offence. A Minister could, thereby, frustrate the will of the people if the proposed amendment to the Constitution is passed.</P>
    <P>Ministerial orders do not normally receive detailed consideration or even the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas. People may feel that they know what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is going to do. They may feel they know what I, or some other Member of the House, would do, but do they know what the Minister will do in ten years' time? Perhaps it will be decided that this is a Bill to deal with pregnancy. This Bill deals with a constitutional issue. Should any Minister in any Government have power, by order, to vary the effect of a constitutional amendment following the vote of the people and enactment by this House? It is a very dangerous proposition. It is something I will be examining very closely.</P>
    <P>I have been reasoned and careful in what I have said today and I ask the Minister to carefully heed what I say about this section. As drafted it gives rise to very serious concerns. He should forget about it being he who is in office and think in <Col N="42" /> terms of who could be there. It might be someone who is extremely conservative or someone who is extremely, so-called, liberal. How, or why, should anybody have the right to vary provisions in the Constitution in such a way?</P>
    <P>I now turn to some of the replies which were given to my colleague, Deputy Noonan, the leader of Fine Gael, by the Taoiseach. A number of my colleagues will be referring to this and I do not want to steal their thunder, but I will mention a few matters in the time that is left to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The official time left to the Deputy is four minutes, but in the context of allowing the Minister to complete his speech he has perhaps another seven minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to get through this as quickly as I can.</P>
      <P>In the reply to the fourth question asked, the Taoiseach told Deputy Noonan that the Government's proposal recognises that it is not practicable to attempt to protect, by the criminal law of abortion, the fertilised ovum prior to implantation in the womb of a woman. That is a very interesting statement. What are its implications for embryo or stem-cell research? Some of the replies given to these questions are hostages to fortune. That is a very interesting statement which requires attention.</P>
      <P>The reply to the seventh question declared that it is not anticipated that the Government's proposals for amendment will impinge on those rights of the unborn and the mother already identified in the Constitution. It is not anticipated, which means that it is not known. Nobody knows whether it will impinge on them. It will be left to the courts. If the courts anticipate in a way that we or the people do not intend, there will nothing we can do about it. The use of words such as &ldquo;anticipate&rdquo; is questionable as one has to ask by whom it is anticipated. It is a very subjective use of language.</P>
      <P>In the reply to Question No. 9, the Taoiseach referred to the possibility of a medical practitioner with no experience or expertise in the area having access to a hospital designated as an approved place for the purpose of the legislation being too remote. Where in the Bill is the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; mentioned? There is no mention of hospitals in the question or the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the past, if somebody told me that I would have a fully equipped office in my house with on-line computer facilities and access to the Oireachtas and that I could send all my e-mails from home, I would have said it was not practical. In time to come, it is likely that there will be sufficient technical capacity &ndash; if it does not already exist &ndash; for any GP to carry out one of these procedures in a surgery. I know the Minister has no intention of licensing a surgery, but he will not be the Minister for-ever. We are giving some future Minister the right to vary this in any way he wants. I do not know, therefore, why the Taoiseach should use the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; as it is not mentioned anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> As I said earlier, a medical practitioner &ndash; not a registered medical practitioner &ndash; straight out of college will have the right to carry out such a procedure. This is quite dangerous. It also says &ldquo;approved places&rdquo; is intended to be applied to hospitals under responsible management possessing adequate expertise in the area of obstetrics and gynaecology. Who says this? It is not in the legislation, nor is it on any proposal before us.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reply to Question No. 10, it says that &ldquo;these safeguards and the parliamentary scrutiny provided for in section 5(4) are considered to be sufficient to prevent the abuse of unauthorised places&rdquo;. They certainly are not. Orders are never scrutinised by this House. They go into the library, which is what will happen to these orders in due course. We will all be so busy with legislation that any Minister could make orders, put copies in the library, and we would not even see them. They certainly will not be debated. We are talking about belts and braces, putting things into the Constitution because they must have its protection. Then we leave the barn gate open for this sort of fudge, which is very peculiar.</P>
    <P>The reply to Question No. 11 says it is not essential that the practitioner must form the opinion unaided or without guidance. That is not the point because it is possible. One does not require any assistance or expertise. One just has to be out of college, qualified as a medical practitioner &ndash; that is all.</P>
    <P>It also says in the reply that the medical practitioner is always &ldquo;responsible for the lawfulness of procedures carried out by him or her&rdquo;. We all know, and the people should know, that if one asked the Medical Council whether its members would follow the Constitution and the law of the land or follow the ethical guidelines of the Medical Council, they would say they would follow the latter. The reference to &ldquo;lawfulness of procedures&rdquo; is not a great assurance.</P>
    <P>The reply to Question No. 14 says it is the Government's view that the medical consensus in the profession is the only thing which now stands between us and <i>the de facto</i> introduction of what they call &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; in this country, a term which some people find offensive. If this is true, why did the Minister not legislate to address the matter before now? Since 1987, this Government has been in office, with the exception of two and a half years. The reply makes a very bold statement. Now, instead of dealing with the issue properly, we have to alter the Constitution to do so. The reply is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>There are questions to be raised concerning the X case and others will do that. I will not do so because it would take too much time to raise the two aspects of the issue that concern me. However, I will return to the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It says in reply to Question No. 17 that &ldquo;there is nothing in the proposed amendment or in the <Col N="44" /> envisaged legislation which would render it illegal for a health board to assist a woman to travel outside the jurisdiction in such cases&rdquo;. This is in reference to the X case. Although it says it is &ldquo;not illegal&rdquo;, is it legal? Will the Minister answer this in his reply to the debate?</P>
    <P>In the reply to Question No. 20, the Taoiseach says &ldquo;no plausible scenario involving any difficulty has been advanced by anyone who has raised the issue of the interaction of the proposed amendment with EU law.&rdquo;. Will the Minister indicate to us in the House the status of this proposal in relation to Protocol 17 of the Maastricht Treaty?</P>
    <P>The reply to Question No. 24 says that &ldquo;the morning after pill as emergency contraception is not effective when implantation is complete&rdquo;. In this respect, it is to be distinguished from the use or administration of chemical abortifacients. This begs the question of whether it can harm, and if so, can it be criminalised under section 43(3)? Most of our discussion in this regard refers to section 43(4).</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state, since he is using the term &ldquo;implantation&rdquo;, when it starts? How long does it take? What is the time frame in terms of the constitutional protection for the implanted unborn? When does that time start running because there is no definition of it? We would like to know how the Minister arrived at that use of wording.</P>
    <P>There are many other questions that may arise in due course. We have touched only on some of them today in the opening of this debate. It is my duty, and that of the Opposition, to closely examine sections of proposed legislation. We will have to be very vigilant in this case as it is intended to incorporate such detailed wording into the Constitution itself. This is the constitutional duty of the Dáil and Seanad and it is a vital part of the democratic process. If the Bill passes and the people vote favourably in the referendum, within 180 days the Oireachtas must put the Bill into effect or else it will fall. It is a most unusual practice to tie the hands of the Oireachtas in this way, not just in terms of what must be dealt with if the people approve this, and to give us no choice but to accept that or to ignore the will of the people. It is a strange choice to give us. We could ignore the will of the people, but never again thereafter will we have the chance to amend that legislation, unless there is a Constitutional amendment. That will not apply to the Medical Council or the Supreme Court, or to the Minister in the orders he would make.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael does not believe it is best practice to incorporate detailed provisions in the Constitution. We recognise that, under Article 6 of the Constitution, it is ultimately a matter for the people to decide. However, legislators have been given the right under the Constitution to decide on which amendment should be put to the people. While the right of the Oireachtas to pass any legislation it deems fit for amendment of the Constitution for consideration by the people is <Col N="45" /> enshrined, Members of the Oireachtas have also been give an Constitutional right and duty to frame such amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The job of the Opposition is to treat serious legislation with the consideration it deserves, point out its weaknesses and try to improve it. This is particularly true of the legislation we are discussing. I hope the Minister will allow the disquisition that is necessary on this Bill and accept the amendment I am tabling today on behalf of Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>Very good. The Labour Party amendment reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;declines to give a Second Reading because</P>
      <P>a) the procedure is legally and constitutionally flawed;</P>
      <P>b) it dilutes the equal right to life of the mother; and</P>
      <P>c) it seeks to overturn the decision taken by the people in 1992 upholding the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Yesterday 18 Irish women travelled to Britain to have abortions. Today as we begin this debate 18 more Irish women are travelling to Britain to have abortions. Tomorrow another 18 will travel. This will go on each day this debate continues and, when the debate is over, nothing will have changed for these women. Approximately 100,000 Irish women have made that journey since 1983 when the people voted to include Article 40.3.3º in the Constitution. It states that the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the Supreme Court determined in the X case that a threat to self-destruction can amount to a substantial risk to the life of the mother. This decision enabled an abused 14 year old girl to have an abortion. Subsequently the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, introduced a new amendment to the Constitution specifically excluding suicide as grounds for consideration in a possible medical termination of pregnancy.</P>
      <P>At the time, the Progressive Democrats Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said in the House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Since the Supreme Court decision in the X case there has been no sudden rush to the courts by women looking for an abortion on the basis that they are suicidal. This is not a particular problem now, and there is no pressing reason to exclude it constitutionally as a basis for a termination in every case in the future. We must be willing to consider the fact that some very unusual suicide case may arise where a woman cannot for some reason or another leave the jurisdiction and where a real and unavoidable risk of self-destruction exists. For example, a young pregnant girl may become severely anorexic after a multiple rape. Such a girl with her unborn could be condemned by this amendment with the hands of the Supreme Court tied, thus preventing any sensible intervention to save her life.</P>
    <P>Almost ten years later he has been proved right. There has been no sudden rush to the courts, even to this day. There was the C case which was an unusual and dreadful suicide case which came before the courts. The courts found in favour of the girl seeking an abortion on the basis of the Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 40.3.3º and her life was saved.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the Labour Party that the removal of suicide as grounds for an abortion would constitute a grave, if rare, risk to women's lives. It was our view in 1992 and it remains our view in 2001. Regrettably, this time around the Progressive Democrats have ditched principle in favour of political expediency. Many people listened to and squirmed at the weasel words of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, at the press conference to launch the Bill when she defended the indefensible somersault executed by her and her party. The choice between radical and redundant has now been made by the Progressive Democrats. They have chosen the latter and are clinging desperately to the Government train until it runs out of steam.</P>
    <P>In 1992 when the amendment was put to the people, they rejected it. Whenever &ndash; if ever, because there is still a doubt about this &ndash; it is put again, I believe the people will reject it again. Now that we are debating the Bill we have a duty to clear away the fog. There has been so much window-dressing, clever disguise and obfuscation by the Government in its presentation of this new amendment that we need to speak plainly in the House. The amendment being presented by the Taoiseach is, in essence, identical to the one put to the people in 1992 by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. It is designed to take away a fundamental right to life Irish women enjoy under our Constitution. Only the removal of suicide as grounds for abortion is at variance with the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court. It is the only part of the Bill which requires a referendum. Despite the fact the people voted to retain that protection for women's lives in 1992, the Government refuses to accept the will of the people and is again pursuing an answer denied to it in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> The chairman of the expert review group on the Constitution, Ken Whitaker, someone who would describe himself as pro-life, considered that about 3% of pregnant women were suicidal or were at risk of suicide. He said during his presentation to the Joint Committee on the Constitution:</P>
    <P>. . . one has to ask oneself in the case not just of pregnant women generally but women who are pregnant and victims of rape or incest, what is the risk? They might figure largely in constituting that 3%. That is the point I am making. I wouldn't get the impression that it has been ruled out completely; it's very rare, but as I rate the thing . . . it's not impossible of course, but it should be perhaps evident in a particularly severe case that there was a serious likelihood of suicide.</P>
    <P>If the four words in line 15 in the Second Schedule, &ldquo;Other than by self-destruction&rdquo;, were removed, there would be no need for a referendum. If those four words were removed from the Bill, it would safeguard the right to life of some poor, unfortunate pregnant woman who might be so distraught, damaged or deranged that she becomes suicidal. That woman could be the daughter of someone in the House, of a secretary, an usher or someone in the media who works in the Oireachtas. We have to ask ourselves, if she were our daughter, what would be our attitude?</P>
    <P>I have asked myself that question. If my daughter were 14 years old, horribly raped and made pregnant, I would hope she might find the strength to carry through the pregnancy. However, if the burden were too great and crushed her spirit to the point that ending her life would be preferable to continuing it, I would want her to have an abortion. If this amendment is passed, that child, who could be the daughter of anyone here, would be criminalised. She could even be jailed for 12 years, assuming she had not committed suicide.</P>
    <P>There was a disturbing coldness evident when the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I accept that some people have concerns about the potential criminalisation of a pregnant woman who procures her own abortion. In practice, of course, prosecutions against women in such a situation are extremely rare, if they have been taken at all for very many years.</P>
    <P>What happens if that rare case is one's daughter? Is that really what we want for our daughters? If not, who exactly is seeking this change?</P>
    <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitution I sat through the hearings held into the wide spectrum of opinion that prevails on the topic of abortion. No agreed wording on an amendment to the Constitution was presented to us. We heard many demands for a referendum from people who spoke strongly and sincerely about their anti-abortion views without a specific <Col N="48" /> definition as to how the Constitution might be changed. There was no ground swell demand to exclude suicide as grounds for an abortion. It was only at the end of the process when three divergent views were clarified in the committee that Fianna Fáil outlined it as their essential position, to remove, in effect, this protection for young women who may be so distraught, damaged or deranged that they become suicidal.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that the reason he wants to remove this right is to prevent a slide into what he calls freely available &ldquo;social&rdquo; abortion. This is risible. Despite the current constitutional protection, we live in a country which has the most restrictive regime on abortion in Europe, where women flee to another jurisdiction to find the succour denied to them at home. We have even been criticised by the UN for having a regime so severe that it infringes fundamental human rights.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach conveniently ignores the simple facts. There is no evidence of any shift towards liberalisation on abortion in the ten years since the X case. During that period about 5,000 women on average travelled to Britain to have abortions. They did so, conveniently for successive Governments, in secrecy and silence. In 1996, the expert constitution review group, chaired by Dr. Ken Whitaker, considered the issue in detail and came to the conclusion that there was no consensus on any amendment to the Constitution and that not only should the Government legislate in line with the X case but that this was the only practical possibility. In making this recommendation, this eminent group of experts believed, unlike the Taoiseach, that women, doctors and legislators could be trusted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern's proposal is less about the protection of women's lives or of the unborn and more about the protection of the life of a Government. It is about a commitment made to four Independent Deputies to secure their support. They sought a referendum without being able to produce a wording. The Government produced &ldquo;suicide&rdquo;, since no one could think of anything better, as the hook to deliver the Independents.</P>
    <P>When this legislation was published, the Taoiseach, in a speech outlining the Government's position, stated that the new law will protect both women and the unborn in pregnancy, but this is not true. The right to life that women currently enjoy under the Constitution will no longer be equal to that of the foetus, if this amendment is passed by referendum. Women's lives will not be protected in the way they are now if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats get their way. The Taoiseach went on to say that the risk of suicide has only been advanced as grounds for abortion in cases where the State, in one way or another, directly or indirectly, was attempting to restrict the freedom of a woman to travel. The new law, he said, will protect that freedom and not compromise it in any way. That is untrue. There is no guarantee that, should another C case arise where a young suicidal girl in the care of the State seeks an abortion abroad, her rights would be <Col N="49" /> safeguarded nor is there any guarantee for the anorexic child in Deputy O'Malley's example.</P>
    <P>However, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste stated that they see their approach as developing a consensus on the issue. This is a distortion of the facts and is dishonest. They know as well as anybody that there is no consensus on abortion in relation to any constitutional change. There never was and it is unlikely that there will in the foreseeable future. After 18 months of exhaustive work by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Brian Lenihan, it was self-evident that there was no consensus. The three different positions reflected within the committee were spelt out carefully and in detail in its report presented to the Taoiseach a year ago. Where there was consensus on the issue of reducing the rate of abortions by establishing a dedicated agency, the Government ignored it until they could wrap that proposal like a disguise around the hard, unpalatable truth that this constitutional amendment is a rerun, in essence, of 1992.</P>
    <P>I can understand that obstetricians want to see the legislative clarity that this Bill provides for the rare procedures they must carry out to save a woman's life. These procedures are abortions and no change in language as provided for in this Bill changes that fact. In his submission to the all-party committee, Dr. Peter McKenna said about this kind of medical procedure:</P>
    <P>Personally, I think that you are better to be up front and clean about this and say that the pregnancy is being aborted. That is the treatment. It is not a side effect of the treatment. It is not that it is an unintentional side effect of the treatment. The treatment is you end the pregnancy. That is, I think, abortion.</P>
    <P>A legal definition as to what is permissible in medical practice was sought by doctors for some time and they will not quibble over the wording.</P>
    <P>However, there are serious questions about the legal implications of the Government's approach, and the Minister in his response needs to clarify the following points. The amendment seeks to add two new subsections to the original Article 40.3.3º and not to replace it. The first question is if while the new amendment and accompanying legislation is specifically designed to protect unborn life in pregnancy and practices relating to IVF, for example, are not covered, will there not be some remaining, if imprecise, effect to be given to the original subsection (3) which might well cover these circumstances and practices? In other words, although the morning after pill, the IUD and rules relating to the disposal of fertilised ova outside the womb will not be covered by the terms of the new Act which deals solely with criminal sanctions for abortion, the question remains as to whether a court might assume jurisdiction to outlaw these other practices by virtue of the original amendment.</P>
    <P>The second question relates to the arbitrary choice of implantation as the point when abortion <Col N="50" /> becomes possible. Many people were startled that the Attorney General appeared to upstage the theologians on the thorny question of when human life begins. Practical rather than philosophical reasons have produced the formula. If implantation is taken as the starting point for this Bill on grounds of practicality because of the difficulties of proving cause and effect in specific cases, surely the same issues of proof would arise when any post-implantation pill is administered. Yet the Government justifies banning these drugs as chemical abortifacients while justifying the widespread availability of the morning after pill.</P>
    <P>The third question relates to the Government's procedure. Unlike the case in the Good Friday Agreement, this constitutional amendment will have effect from the day it is signed into law by the President. As and from that day it will require that the unborn in the womb shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of an Act that does not at that stage exist. Essentially, therefore, a section of the Constitution, which has no meaning or effect, will be given meaning and effect by an ordinary Act of the Oireachtas coming into force at a later date. Does this not run contrary to every constitutional principle?</P>
    <P>It is clear that the level of detail needed to deal with this issue is more appropriate for ordinary legislation than for direct insertion into the Constitution. At least one reason is because ordinary legislation can be amended more easily if it proves necessary. However, in this case the Government proposes that its Bill should be as cumbersome to amend as the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>Section 1(3) of the proposed Act defines &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; as meaning a &ldquo;person permitted for the time being by law to practise as a medical practitioner in the State&rdquo;. Any medical practitioner, as so defined, will be entitled lawfully to terminate a pregnancy under the Bill, if he or she has formed in good faith a reasonable opinion that it is necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of a woman's life. Presumably a more specific definition was avoided in the context of a statute which itself will be so difficult to amend. Even the slightest unforeseen error in the drafting of the Bill would require yet another referendum to correct it.</P>
    <P>The interpretation of &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; seems to have been drafted on the assumption that Irish law permits some people to practise medicine and prohibits others from doing so. However, this assumption is false. There is no law that prevents any of us from setting ourselves up as medical practitioners. The only ban is on us holding ourselves out as registered medical practitioners, that is, persons registered in the General Register of Medical Practitioners established under section 26 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council maintains a register in which suitably qualified persons are entered. They are then referred to as &ldquo;registered medical practitioners&rdquo;. It is an offence to make a false declar<Col N="51" /> ation in order to be entered on the register or to misrepresent oneself as registered if one is not. In addition, the Medical Council has powers to suspend doctors from the register or to apply for them to be struck off, on grounds of unfitness to practise. At the same time &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; and &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine thrive here. Alternative medical practitioners practise lawfully in this State, provided that they do not claim to be what they are not &ndash; registered medical practitioners. There is no rule in Irish law which prohibits unregistered persons from practising medicine.</P>
    <P>If one asks then, for the purposes of the draft Bill, who is permitted for the time being by law to practise as a medical practitioner in the State, the answer is anyone. Unregistered medical practitioners may not be able to prescribe medicines but they will be able, under this Bill, to advise as to the need for a pregnancy to be terminated and to carry out such a termination themselves. The defect in drafting which I have highlighted may be small and easily corrected but its effect if it were not spotted would have been to drive a coach and four through the Government's Bill.</P>
    <P>The point must be that despite rigorous scrutiny in the Attorney General's Office, at the Cabinet sub-committee and at Government itself, and despite also the fact that this form of words has now been in the public domain for well over a fortnight, this error has so far gone unnoticed. What would have been the situation if it had entered into law? If this interpretation is correct, we would have ended up, possibly, with the most liberal abortion laws in western Europe.</P>
    <P>Whatever else this may be, the Bill does not amount to an attempt to deal comprehensively, even in terms of a criminal statute, with the protection of life in the womb. Leaving aside the issue of abortion for the moment, the Legislatures of most other common law jurisdictions have recognised the deficiencies of the criminal law in identifying and punishing threats to unborn life.</P>
    <P>If this legislation was truly attempting to fulfil a constitutional imperative to defend unborn human life, it would make an attempt, as has been done in other countries, to update and reform our homicide rules so as to close the identifiable loopholes that have given rise to difficulties elsewhere and are bound to do so here. If this opportunity were taken we would be enacting rules of law to clarify the circumstances in which liability under the law of homicide is imposed in respect of a variety of acts done before or during childbirth.</P>
    <P>What we have here is a Bill that is legally and constitutionally flawed. It is one that attempts to reduce the right to life of women. It does nothing to tackle the daily reality of so many thousands of Irish women who travel abroad to seek the help they are denied at home. It seeks to overturn the decision made by the Irish people in 1992, a free decision exercised in this independent Republic in which we are happy to live.</P>
    <P>Like many other people, I watched the funerals of Kevin Barry and his comrades that took place <Col N="52" /> recently. These men fought and died to give us independence and freedom. They helped to create this Republic. Thanks to them we live as a free people enjoying our prosperity and our new found confidence. Their sacrifice was made in order that we could win self-determination over our destiny and could build a State that would meet the needs of our citizens and reflect our dreams and ambitions. We take pride in that independence and in our success as a country. Yet for thousands of Irish citizens Fianna Fáil has only one answer. Despite that great tradition, for these thousands of Irish citizens, it has one answer when the question is raised. The answer is this: when you are in a crisis, when you are desperate and in need do not turn to us for assistance. Far from meeting their needs this great Republican party offers only one solution to these Irish citizens &ndash; take yourselves off to the old enemy. Britain will provide you with the safe professional help that we deny you. English doctors will provide the care for Irish women, even when their lives depend upon it.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil wants to protect the right to travel and will let Irish citizens travel. Hopefully they have the price of the fare because if they cannot afford to travel, as many women cannot, that is hard luck. Essentially, that is the Irish solution to the Irish problem. It is not a new one but what is being done in this Bill is to restrict further the rights of Irish women.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes part of public discourse and young people have an opportunity for the first time to debate the reality of abortion and when those hidden repressed voices of women who have had this experience are finally heard then we shall have a real debate and will have to face hard realities. Instead of that domineering bullying that is encompassed in the Bill we will get the truth about women dealing with crises in their lives that no man ever has to deal with. I look forward to that debate. I spent time at the hearings of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Those hearings were valuable in terms of providing much information in a methodical and orderly fashion. We heard from men from religious bodies and from men from the legal profession. A few women were present but not one Irish woman felt brave, secure or comfortable enough to tell us her story and to talk about her life experience. What is it like to be 22 years of age, in an unplanned, unexpected pregnancy and without support and being told to go away to another country where you will know nobody to get the professional help you seek? I heard one woman who felt secure enough talk about this at a meeting. She said she got the information on how to get an abortion off the toilet door in the ladies' lavatory in Trinity College. Fortunately, her boyfriend was supportive and helped her to go because she knew she wanted an abortion. While people may talk about social abortions or theological abortions, women will have abortions. This young woman went to Britain. When she was leaving after the procedure was over the <Col N="53" /> doctor put her on a course of antibiotics which worried her. She asked the doctor if she had an infection to which he replied: &ldquo;No, but you are Irish. We give all the Irish girls a dose of antibiotics because they do not go back to their doctors when they go home and the risk of an infection is much greater as a result&rdquo;. That is the reality of abortion, not what is contained in the Bill or notions about restricting the right to life of women.</P>
    <P>If the referendum is held, I believe it will ultimately be defeated. However, I hope the benefits of the referendum campaign will be that the truth will emerge, that we will discuss the reality as it is experienced by thousands of citizens and that we will begin to confront that reality as legislators and as parents with a responsibility towards the younger generation.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt anyone on the Opposition side. Members should, therefore, do me the courtesy of allowing me to have my say and I will reciprocate.</P>
      <P>Whatever one may think of the Supreme Court judgment in the X case, there is widespread agreement with the observation of Mr. Justice McCarthy that nine years after the 1983 referendum had been passed by the Irish people the delay in introducing legislation to flesh out the implications of that amendment to the Constitution was not only unfortunate but inexcusable. Those remarks had considerable force in 1992 but they have even greater force now and the strength of their import increases with each day that passes. The Governments which came to power following the 1983 referendum, including that in which Deputy Dukes played a prominent role, could, from one point of view, be accused of cowardice in failing to deal with this matter. The Government of which Deputy Dukes was a member was succeeded by a minority Fianna Fáil Administration and, subsequently, one dominated by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that, in 1992, the then Fianna Fáil led Government made an attempt to tackle this issue by way of constitutional amendment. Unsurprisingly, that attempt was not successful. However, this was not, as Deputy McManus <Col N="54" /> would have us believe, because everybody in Ireland suddenly decided that the judgment in the X case was wonderful and should be supported by two thirds of the people. Deputies will recall the charged atmosphere in which the debate took place in 1992 and, in my view, the main characteristic of that debate was that matters were misunderstood. The Government's attempt to explain to the people what it was attempting to do at that point was marred by misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>People, including some members of the clergy, who advertised themselves as &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo;, represented to the Irish people &ndash; particularly those who saw themselves as enlightened and liberal &ndash; that the Government of the day was trying to impose a regime similar to the current Taliban regime in Afghanistan. We were accused of using the law to impose the religious mores of a certain section of society on the population as a whole. That is what people who liked to think of themselves were led to believe. On the other hand, those who regarded themselves as pro-life were led to believe, particularly by some of their spiritual advisers, that what was about to engulf the country was a tidal wave of abortion and that the Government of the day was using the amendment to the Constitution as a fig leaf designed to create an illusion that it was trying to take action when in reality it could not do so.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which the current proposal is being brought forward could hardly be more different. The Minister has outlined the exhaustive process of consultation, deliberation, analysis, study, etc., which has led, during the past four years and three months, to this proposal being advanced. The arguments in the interim have centred around what type of response would be appropriate, namely, should we just legislate or was it necessary to have another constitutional amendment? The situation was seen as a dichotomy &ndash; there would either be one or the other. The people who advanced both arguments were wrong. Those who advocated a simple constitutional amendment were wrong because it has now been demonstrated beyond argument that inserting a simple, direct phrase into the Constitution will not resolve this problem because it is far too complex. I served as a Minister of State in the Government which introduced the constitutional amendment in 1992 and I recall that people on the pro-life side, who had access to extremely good legal advice, submitted many different phrases to the Attorney General's office but, alas, they were always informed that if these phrases were considered in a certain way, the Supreme Court could arrive at a judgment similar to that which it reached in the X case.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, those who argue for a legislative response without constitutional amendment are equally wrong for two reasons. The first of these &ndash; Deputy Gay Mitchell recognised it &ndash; is people's belief that this issue is too important to be left solely to the legislators. I believe it was Lloyd George who said that war was too important a matter to be left to the generals and <Col N="55" /> the people believe &ndash; I tend to agree with them &ndash; that this matter is too important to be left solely to legislators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that there is a legitimate concern abroad that if a matter is dealt with by the House simply by way of legislation it will be open to change in the future &ndash; this is particularly true when one considers what might be the Government of the day and on whom it might be obliged to rely for support &ndash; without any reference to the people. The latter are saying that this matter is so fundamental and important that it should be referred back to them in the event of any changes being made. In my view, that is a perfectly reasonable proposition.</P>
      <P>There is another reason for constitutional intervention in this matter. I disagree with the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case. Unlike certain parties in this House, I am prepared to state my position in unequivocal terms. I fundamentally disagree with the notion that the threat or possibility of suicide should be a ground for allowing an abortion &ndash; the deliberate destruction of a human foetus &ndash; to take place in this jurisdiction. That is my sincere, genuine and honest belief. Even if we legislated for this matter and put in place what could be regarded as safeguards, we will be obliged to rely on the subjective of a practitioner in a field of science which is, let us face it, quite inexact. One can measure whether a woman's life is in physical danger &ndash; that has been accepted and is current medical practice &ndash; but it is impossible to ever objectively measure whether somebody is going to commit suicide. The Minister has already outlined that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus painted a heart-rending picture of somebody's daughter who was raped, who had an unwanted pregnancy and who, perhaps, did not have the fare to travel to England and stated that we would condemn her to the possibility of committing suicide. The Minister referred to the relevant statistics in some detail and they prove that if we provide for suicide as the basis for somebody to seek an abortion, at some stage &ndash; it has not happened yet and I will explain why in a moment &ndash; there is a strong probability that we will eventually have in Ireland a regime of abortion on demand. The Minister indicated the number of abortions carried out in the UK last year because pregnant mothers said that they felt suicidal and their assertions were accepted. Is anybody in a position to say the number of cases in which what these women said was <Col N="56" /> not true? How many innocent unborn lives were destroyed because this was part of the law in Britain?</P>
    <P>People will say that this is the law as a result of the Supreme Court decision in the X case and there has been no rush to avail of it in the sense that people have presented themselves to their medical practitioners and stated they are suicidal and, therefore, require an abortion. The reality is, however, that this would be a fruitless exercise as matters stand. The existing code of ethics of the Irish medical profession is, in my opinion, the only thing that stands between the current legal position in this country and a slide into a situation where one has abortion on demand. There is no situation in a crisis pregnancy where certain action has to be taken and where one can have total and absolute mathematical equality of the life of the mother and that of the child. If the life of the mother is in mortal physical danger, then certain actions have to be taken even if that inevitably results in the death of the child. However, saying that is not inconsistent with saying that we must afford the greatest possible measure of protection to both the mother and the child in a pregnancy. It is my contention and the view of the Government that the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case did not provide for that. The state of the law as a result of the decision in the X case exposes innocent unborn life in this country to a mortal danger. The only matter standing in the way of that danger becoming a reality is the current code of practice, and I stress the word &ldquo;current&rdquo;, of the Irish medical profession. As Deputy Gay Mitchell said, that can change and is liable to do so.</P>
    <P>That temporary barrier would be further weakened by further legislation based on the flawed judgment of the Supreme Court. Any political party which is willing to sit back and allow the medical profession to stand in the way of something it cannot face up to is being dishonest. Any Government which would allow that situation to continue indefinitely is hardly worthy of the name.</P>

    <P>The Opposition response to this matter is curious to say the least. In 1992, the Labour Party adopted as a policy position that it believed in legislation to bring the effect of the X case into law. Suddenly the Labour Party found itself in Government. It was not just part of one Government but two, though it became part of the second by accident. The life of either Government could not have carried on without the <Col N="57" /> Labour Party but nothing was done. I was Minister of State in one of those Governments and I say without equivocation that the issue of dealing with the Supreme Court judgment in accordance with pre-Government Labour Party policy was never even mooted. There was not a tittle about it. When grasping the nettle was mooted, the Labour Party proved more elusive than Macavity the Mystery Cat. It ran away from it faster than the British Army at the Battle of New Orleans. It did not want to hear about it. That was its attitude when it had a chance to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus made a heartrending speech about an unfortunate girl who was raped and pregnant; she could not go to England and she could be somebody's daughter. That unfortunate girl would have had no recourse to any medical treatment in Ireland during the Labour Party's time in office. The code of medical ethics of the Irish medical profession dictated that and it could only have been changed by legislation. Why did the Labour Party not change that by way of legislation? Why did it not provide for that imagined poor unfortunate when they were in Government for four and a half years?</P>

      <P>When the Labour Party went back into Opposition, suddenly its latent liberalism came flying to the boil again and the policy was reincarnated. It then advocated that the next Government should do what it had run away from and that it would reserve for itself the right to criticise the Government for doing what it had consistently, and with intent aforethought, funked and avoided for four and a half years. That is not a very edifying spectacle for a party that is supposed to represent a certain point of view nor is it a very ethical posture.</P>
      <P>The recent Labour Party conference passed a motion, if I interpret the English language correctly, looking for an abortion regime in this country which would literally constitute abortion on demand. Deputy McManus was asked about this on television. Let us recall that Deputy McManus was, in her previous incarnation, a member of Democratic Left, which is now sadly expired, and was very liberal on abortion. Her views were exactly in line with the motion passed by the Labour Party conference. Yet she stated on television that she voted against that motion. Why has she changed policy?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had four and a half years of deliberation, in which Fine Gael participated. We have <Col N="59" /> parsed, analysed, debated, deliberated and agonised over this for four and a half years. Much of that took place in the full view of the nation on television. What is the Fine Gael response at the end of the day? It wants three more months. Is the main Opposition party so bereft of policies and ideas that it has to advance such threadbare arguments?</P>
    <P>I always listen carefully to Deputy Mitchell because I have great respect for him. His opposition to the Bill consisted of stating that a medical practitioner is not defined as registered; the Supreme Court would have more scope for interpretation; the fine was unspecified; the press conference was hurriedly and unexpectedly called, after four and a half years; the type of records to be kept by medical practitioners are not sufficiently defined; and if something is not illegal, does that mean it is legal?</P>
    <P>That is the level of the main Opposition party. Deputy Mitchell's final shot was that this is flawed and that we should not be protecting legislation with the Constitution because if the legislation turns out to be flawed, one will need another referendum to change it. If one took that argument to its logical conclusion we should never amend the Constitution, as the wording of the amendment might be flawed and we would need a referendum to change that. To take it further to its illogical conclusion, we should not have a written Constitution at all because something in it might subsequently turn out to be flawed and we would need a referendum to change it.</P>
    <P>All branches of the medical profession have expressed support for this Government proposal. That is not surprising either because I know the medical profession was confused by the uncertainty about the state of the law. That caused great worry among the profession, and among pregnant women, many of whom were suffering sufficient distress already. That aspect is one on which even the Opposition, in its confusion and in its search for a stance, should agree with us and which it should welcome.</P>

The main public criticism &ndash; I take no notice of the Opposition because I have described its performance &ndash; by commentators has been to accuse the Government of a NIMBY approach &ndash; not in my back yard. They say there are 6,500 unfortunates who went to England last year for abortions and the Government is willing to let them off while it continues whistling past the graveyard, but the fact is that the logical conclusion of what they are saying is that since this is happening near us and all <Col N="60" /> around the world, we should introduce it immediately. There are many things which we have democratically decided should be illegal here which are legal elsewhere. The right to travel is absolute. We do not &ndash; nor, in practice, could we &ndash; put up road blocks or checkpoints to stop people travelling out of this country on the basis that we think, feel or suspect that they are going to do something legally abroad which they cannot do legally here.</P>

      <P>The Standing Order under which Members of this House are limited to 20 minutes on any Bill is stupid. It is inappropriate for a Bill of this kind, although I must recognise that part of the reason it was brought in was that we occasionally get treated to bouts of knockabout comedy like the one in which the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, just indulged.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, stated:</P>
      <P>The Government has concluded that there is no simple sentence or paragraph that can be inserted into the Constitution which, by itself, would amount to a balanced, effective, legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree. The Minister is entirely correct. However, what the Government has done is to bring in an excessively complex mechanism, an amendment to the Constitution and the text of a Bill, a Bill within a Bill, which the Oireachtas can <Col N="61" /> either pass or reject, but not amend. The Oireachtas cannot amend that Bill once it has been passed; it can be amended only by a referendum of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very odd procedure and has been adopted for very odd reasons. I do not expect the Government to produce satisfactory reasons for the many aspects of this Bill, the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, which I find objectionable. I say that having very carefully read and re-read the Taoiseach's responses to the 34 questions which Deputy Noonan posed on the various issues arising. I do not for a moment believe the Taoiseach drafted these responses, but he has set his name to them and made them his own. I assume the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General had substantial roles to play also in the drafting of those responses. That worries me because I find both the formulation and the tone of those responses deeply disturbing. A strong streak of misogyny runs through those responses. At no point do they show any understanding of the concerns of a woman in what we now call a &ldquo;crisis pregnancy&rdquo;. Still less do these responses show any compassion. The whole tone is mechanical, cold, technocratic and dismissive of any hint of emotion. These responses are clearly based on the proposition that hard cases make bad law. They totally ignore the equally valid proposition &ndash; we have a full illustration of it in the context of this Bill &ndash; that bad law makes hard cases. God knows, we should have learned that by now in this context.</P>
      <P>As I read it, the Bill sets out to do three things directly and one thing indirectly. It sets out directly: to define abortion; to remove from the Constitution the provision that a risk of self-destruction can be a ground for abortion; and to give legislative &ndash; we could call it &ldquo;quasi-constitutional&rdquo;&ndash; cover to current medical practices in relation to the termination of pregnancy. It sets out indirectly to legalise the use of the &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; pill and IUDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all convinced that we need a referendum to define abortion, as it is defined in this Bill, to give legislative cover to current medical practice or to permit the use of the &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; pill and IUDs. Each of those three things could be done within the framework of the Constitution, as it stands, by appropriate legislative action. I reject the Government's contention that a constitutional amendment is necessary to do these things, since it amounts to nothing less than a capitulation to the lobby which has contended for 20 years that legislators cannot be trusted on these issues. This, we should remember, is the same lobby which got even the presentation of its own case entirely wrong in 1982, which rejected <Col N="62" /> advice about the potential effects of its actions and which, ever since, has been endeavouring to find a way of rectifying that mistake without once admitting the error in the first place. I reject that view. I reject the Government's capitulation to it. I reject the Government's attempt in this Bill to fetter the Houses of the Oireachtas by presenting to them the text of a Bill which they can either accept or reject, but not amend. I reject the idea that any future amendment to the proposed Bill can be effected only by a further referendum. This Government is proposing that the Houses of the Oireachtas abdicate their constitutional functions in this matter. I did not get elected to come in here to abdicate my functions in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to contrast that with the proposal in this Bill within a Bill to allow the Government to do certain things by Order. The Minister told us this morning that these Orders are in a form where they can be rejected by a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days of their being passed. I have been a Member of this House for more than 20 years. Not once have I ever seen an Order Paper of this House which contained a reference or a proposal to debate an Order made by any Government in that form. It is only by being put on the Order Paper by the Government that such an Order can be debated. There are reasons for making those Orders in certain cases; they are far more limited than the current practice. In the case of this Bill, I can guarantee that if that is passed, no Order on foot of that made by any Government, especially if it is of the mind set of the present Government, will ever have a snowball's chance in hell of coming before this House to be debated. Therefore, the provision which states that this House can have some function in that is entirely unreal.</P>
      <P>The definition of abortion in this Bill within a Bill could be by way of a straightforward amendment to the relevant sections of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. In the Government's response to Question No. 8 posed by Deputy Michael Noonan, I find the statement:</P>
      <P>Section 2 replaces the existing criminal offence of &ldquo;procuring a miscarriage&rdquo; which is provided for in Section 58 and Section 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.</P>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent the Government from proposing the necessary amendment to that Act. Such an amendment would fall perfectly within the function of legislation as envisaged in Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that amendment were made to the 1861 Act it would have the same effect in relation to the use of the morning after pill and IUDs as the infinitely more complex measure now proposed by the Government. It is the definition of abortion contained in the Bill within a Bill which removes any doubt as to the legality of the morning after <Col N="63" /> pill and IUDs. The same effect would be achieved by a simple amendment to the 1861 Act.</P>
    <P>The Government claims the effect of section 2(2) of the Bill within a Bill is to give legislative cover to currently accepted medical practice. On the face of it, that is true. As with the definition of abortion, it seems that the same effect could be achieved by inserting this subsection, or most of it, into an amendment to the 1861 Act; we would get exactly the same effect by a straightforward amendment to the 1861 Act. In fact, the measure proposed by the Government is not quite as clear as it pretends. It gives legislative cover to whatever happens to be the currently agreed ethical standards adopted by the medical profession at any given time. If we do what the Government proposes, we will not simply give legislative cover to a defined set of standards in force today, we will give legislative and, indeed, quasi-constitutional cover to whatever those standards happen to be at the time of the passage of the legislation and to any changes that might subsequently be agreed by the medical profession, whether those changes be in either a more liberal or in a more conservative direction.</P>
    <P>The Government proposes that we hand over an unknowable power to the medical profession to decide what those standards would be. It is a blank cheque to the medical profession, which is not a desirable way to proceed. I do not say this out of any distrust or disrespect for the medical profession, quite the contrary. I do not believe that this Legislature should pass such a burden to the ethical mentors of the medical profession. Why does the Government not propose, for example, to enshrine in legislation the currently accepted formulation of accepted practice by the medical profession? Why does the Government not enshrine such a formulation in legislation which can, if necessary, and on the advice of the medical profession, be amended in the ordinary way in the ordinary course of legislation with which we deal daily in this House? The answer is that the Government is afraid to take on its responsibilities and that it has caved in to pressure groups who, in the face of their own mistakes, still insist that legislators cannot be trusted. The Government's proposal is both a debasement and a perversion of the proper role of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>The Government wants to roll back the basis of the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case. Nowhere in the 20 page response to Deputy Noonan's 34 questions is there any indication that the Government has any understanding of, or sympathy for, what must have been a deeply traumatic experience for the young woman involved in that case. The Government's comment on this in the framework of the response to Question No. 7 is to say, in relation to the threat of suicide constituting a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother:</P>
    <P>. . . it is noteworthy that the only occasions upon which it has ever been suggested that threat or risk of suicide was a justification for having an abortion within the State were <Col N="64" /> occasions upon which individual women were being prevented against their wishes from exercising the freedom to travel to another State.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated that this morning. That must be one of the most chillingly unsympathetic statements I have seen in this context for many years. That particular response goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals have been specifically drafted with a view to ensuring that the non-recognition of the risk of suicide as a ground for a lawful termination of the life of the unborn in Ireland does not result in persons who would otherwise be free to travel abroad being refused permission in any circumstances by any Court exercising personal jurisdiction over them from doing so.</P>
    <P>That is a hell of a mouthful of a sentence. The Government is saying that its answer to a suicidal disposition on the part of a young woman with a crisis pregnancy is to say to that woman, &ldquo;buy a ticket to England&rdquo;. I find that absolutely appalling. The Government's response goes on further:</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the proposed amendment or in the envisaged legislation which would render it illegal for a health board to assist a woman to travel outside the jurisdiction in such a case.</P>
    <P>That is true. There is equally nothing in the proposals that would oblige a health board to assist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth noting that there is a clear implication that a health board can form a judgment on the reality of suicidal intent &ndash; otherwise why would the Government be talking about this &ndash; something which the Government suggests it cannot or should not do itself. There is here an implicit admission of the Government's disingenuousness in the presentation of its case.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Government does not trust anything that might be said about her state of mind by a woman in a crisis pregnancy. That is why it intends to remove the suicidal intent basis from the Constitution. That is made very clear in the Government's response to Question No. 14 from Deputy Noonan where it is stated that it is the Government's view that:</P>
      <P>. . . the medical consensus in the medical profession is the only thing which now stands between us and the <i>de facto</i> introduction of &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; in this country. The legislative vacuum which now exists must be filled. If legal provision were made for suicide risk, a system of psychiatric assessment and court supervision would, almost inevitably, follow. If that were to happen, even if it were initially done on a narrow basis, the scene would be set for a gradual introduction of &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> What that says is that it is the Government's belief that women with crisis pregnancies and their psychiatric assessors would systematically and falsely claim suicidal intent in order to secure abortions. Such a view would be perfectly consistent with the streak of misogyny that runs all the way through the Government's responses to these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It also displays a fine contempt for a particular branch of the medical profession. Furthermore, it ignores the fact that, notwithstanding the judgment in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case, there has not been any evident disposition to seek abortions here on the ground of suicidal intent, in accordance with the jurisprudence. Although the law and jurisprudence state that the ground available in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case is available to women here, nothing is being provided. Even if someone were to request an abortion on those grounds the service is not being made available. It is clear the Government has set its mind against taking the word of a pregnant woman or her psychiatric assessor.  </P>
      <P>The reference in the passage which I have just quoted to &ldquo;court supervision&rdquo; is, I suppose, understandable. What is not understandable &ndash; rather entirely deplorable &ndash; is the tone of the response by the Government to Deputy</P>
      <P>Noonan's Question No. 16, &ldquo;What will be the position of a woman who is pregnant as a result of rape under this legislation?&rdquo; The response to that question contains a series of legalistic questions which are described in the Government's response as &ldquo;very human issues&rdquo;, but which make no reference to the feelings of the woman in the case or to the fact already well known &ndash; the Minister of State can quote chapter and verse on this &ndash; that there is abundant evidence that many cases of rape go unreported because the victims cannot contemplate the idea of adding further trauma to what they have already suffered. The Government chooses simply to dismiss all that and say it is not a relevant consideration in anything we do about the law or the Constitution in this regard.</P>
      <P>As far as I can determine, the Government's case for rolling back the judgment in the X case rests solely and entirely on the proposition that in some way the X case opens the way for what the Government chooses to call social abortion. The term &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; is a new one to me and one which I believe will be deeply offensive to many women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies. It is another sign of the Government's callousness that it seems to make no distinction between women who are emotionally traumatised to the point of feeling suicidal as a result of a crisis pregnancy and what I suspect is a small minority of women in affluent western societies who unwisely choose to treat abortion as another form of contraception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir. The political and social frameworks of those countries and regimes are and were vastly different from the society in which we live. All that I have read and heard about conditions in those societies and regimes indicates that, in the final analysis, women who found themselves having a series of abortions never undertook them lightly and were seriously traumatised by the complex of issues surrounding their individual cases. That has been the case, and may still be to some extent, in much of central and eastern Europe and Russia, and it is still the case in China.</P>
      <P>In all those cases, poverty, the lack of easy access to practical methods of contraception and low educational standards were important factors in determining behaviour. In some cases, political repression is or was a major factor. In all cases, most women felt they had little choice in the matter. Most are traumatised to a greater or lesser degree. Very few of the people who have experienced it would view what the Government chooses to call social abortion as a desirable norm and there are very few cases in the developed western world where there is any substantial body of opinion that would propose what the Government chooses to dismiss as social abortion as a norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the matters the Government sets out to do in this complicated proposal other than the rollback of the X case can be done by legislation, the honest thing for the Government to do, if it really wants to roll back the X case, would be simply to propose an amendment to modify Article 40.3.3º accordingly. In that way, the electorate would be faced with a very clear issue rather than the complex matters raised in this Bill. I have no doubt that the electorate would be capable of dealing with that question, especially if we were in a position where the definition of abortion, the protection of current medical practice and the use of the morning after pill and IUDs had already been dealt with by legislation. As it happens, the electorate rejected such a proposal in 1992 but if the Government is serious <Col N="67" /> and honest about what it wants to do, it will put that proposal again.</P>
    <P>In choosing the complex formula which is before us, the Government has unnecessarily obscured the real issues. It has proposed a legislative and constitutional monster which could, in the future, be prayed in aid by any group, which, like the sponsors of the original pro-life amendment, decides that it knows better and is more to be trusted than legislators duly elected in democratic, constitutional general elections.</P>

      <P>I fully support this measure from the Government. It is a reasonable, sensitive and intelligent way of dealing with an issue which has caused great concern and anxiety over a number of years. It is a move which has been a long time coming. In the view of many people, the process to get to this point has been very slow but there has been a great deal of consultation, which the Minister outlined this morning, including the Green Paper, the All-party Committee on the Constitution and the Cabinet sub-committee. It was a long and slow procedure but it was well worthwhile in that all political, medical and other representatives in society were given the opportunity to be involved and to give their point of view.</P>
      <P>I do not know if we can ever please the Opposition. For years we were told that this was a complex medical and social issue and that no simple measure can solve the problem, yet when the Government comes forward with a proposal, after deep consideration, Deputy Dukes says it is not necessary and that it could be done by way of a simple amendment to the 1861 legislation. The Government policy has been deeply thought out. The legislation enshrined in the constitutional amendment and the setting up of the caring agency takes account of the best views that have come forward, specifically from the all-party Oireachtas committee.</P>
      <P>The people who pushed for the 1983 referendum were against the introduction of widespread abortion in the country. While that referendum has been criticised by many people since&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and at the time, it was successful and has kept at bay the fears expressed by many people at that time. We owe a great deal of thanks to the good sense of the medical profession ever since. People in the medical profession, of different shades on this matter, deserve our thanks. I would not extend that to <Col N="68" /> some people in the legal profession who seem to spend half their lives trying to dig up cases that could cause difficulty and raise legal questions to which the answers are not readily available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people in the legal profession who always seem to have an agenda, but perhaps their job is to come up with difficult questions that have not been thought of previously. The decision of the people in the 1983 referendum was clear and there was no doubt about what people wanted. They wanted to outlaw abortion while recognising the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
      <P>Many people believe abortion to be the great scourge of our time. Many have strong religious views on it but outside of that it is a major human rights issue. It amazes me that people who are champions of human rights in regard to issues in different parts of the world do not regard the protection of the life of the unborn as a human rights issue. It is a human rights issue and I very much welcome this decision.</P>
      <P>The X case decision was amazing to the people who voted for that referendum in 1983 and thought they had given a very clear view. Accepting that the courts are there to interpret the laws, people still found it extraordinary to be told that, when they voted one way, they really meant to vote the opposite way. Why do people criticise the principle of going to the people in a referendum? Allowing the people to choose rather than operating entirely by legislation is the exercise of democracy in its purest form. I cannot understand the position of those who say that the voters have to be saved from themselves, that somebody else on high knows better. Why do some people try to avoid a referendum, which is the purest form of democracy?</P>
      <P>The Labour Party amendment, particularly section (f2&gt;c), opposes the Government Bill on the grounds that it seeks to overturn the decision taken by the people in 1992 upholding the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case. While I accept that in 1992 people from both sides voted against that referendum, the interpretation which Deputy McManus is putting on it is quite ridiculous in trying to claim credit for that defeat and saying that was the decision of the people. That measure was defeated in 1992 because a majority of the people on the pro-life side saw it as limited abortion at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <P>People from both sides voted against it but the vast majority of those voting against it were from the pro-life side, because <Col N="69" /> they saw it as limited abortion. Perhaps we are all more enlightened nine years later and perhaps we now realise it is not just a pure &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; situation. For that, we can thank the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which invited in the medical people and others concerned to tease out these issues, as a result of which certain clarifications emerged and some of the easy phrases or black and white interpretations being used previously were dispelled.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the initial response and support of the mainstream pro-life groups to this Government proposal. I know there are some on, as it were, the pure pro-life side who are not fully happy. Within my parliamentary party, I see myself as slightly on the conservative side, though some people might label me as being slightly more to the right. I hope we can bring people to see that this is a very fair-minded and enlightened measure by the Government. It is very much a middle-of-the-road position. If passed it will provide a good defensible position to hold back the slide towards social abortion. It is ridiculous to complain that it does not outlaw the morning after pill. No Government would ever consider doing so. People on the extreme wing of that movement who take that view and who want an ultimate yes or no may as well support the Taliban because that is the only kind of politician likely to take that rather ridiculous position.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has a position on the matter and is adhering to an annual conference motion. It has stated loudly and clearly that it believes in pro-choice, the right of a woman to choose. I am against that position, but at least Labour is adhering to a stated position. Some, including my constituency colleague from the Labour Party, have very quickly run away from that position but Deputy McManus is clearly proclaiming a definite position. Fine Gael, on the other hand, does not seem to have a position. Basically, according to its amendment, that party wants the issue stalled for three months so its members can have more time to make up their minds.</P>

      <P>Most people over 30 years of age have been discussing this matter for some years and have a considered view on it. Fine Gael should make up its mind. Perhaps the liberal wing is calling the shots. To quote a recent statement by President Bush in another context, &ldquo;on some of these matters, you are either with us or against us&rdquo;. It is up to Fine Gael people to make up their minds and let us know where they stand.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken the right position. It is a very complex issue and it is difficult to get a balanced view on it. In 1983, the Supreme Court was critical of the Oireachtas, in that, after the referendum, we did not introduce legislation or even consider the matter. The present approach of having a referendum in which the legislation is included will give people great trust. That is the basis for the Constitution. We do not go to the people on a daily or weekly basis on every decision or legislative measure but people like to have a say on certain fundamental matters. The Government is now giving the people that opportunity by attaching the legislation for their consideration. That is a very far-seeing move, perhaps following the headline of the Good Friday legislation. The people will know that the legislation cannot be changed without it being referred back to them.</P>
      <P>The measure in the Bill is not new. It was the third option in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which had discussed it for many months. It protects both women and the unborn in pregnancy and it accommodates all existing medical practices. It gives complete protection to medical procedures which are necessary to avoid risks. The medical profession sought such legislation. They were concerned about the possibility of legal proceedings being taken against them for doing what they are good at &ndash; protecting the life of the mother and the unborn child. Medical people were being quoted rightly or wrongly by different groups. The all-party committee did considerable good by questioning those people and determining there is a small number of very rare cases where medical treatment is necessary to save the life of a woman. That will now be protected by this measure. I would not call that abortion. It is a medical procedure necessary to save the life of the mother. However, at least we now have the medical people saying the same thing and they cannot be misquoted by extreme groups on either side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was somewhat bemused by Deputy Dukes saying he is opposed to the Government measure. He suddenly claims that we could solve this prob<Col N="71" /> lem by an amendment to the 1861 Act. If life were that simple, it is incredible that no Government took that measure in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable for society to want to lay down rules or guidelines on what it wants of society. Nobody is perfect. I listened to Deputy Liz McManus this morning. While people may speak with passion, I hope this debate is carried out in a calm and reasonable manner. It is a very sensitive, emotive and personal issue.</P>

I cannot be sure I would not be on the plane to the UK with my daughter nor could any other person. It is not possible to be absolutely firm in one's own conviction until a problem arises.

I would like to think that in this or another walk of life, I could live by my deeply held principles but nobody can be absolutely sure of that. That is not hypocrisy and does not take from the sincerity of people or their right to have their aspirations enshrined in law or the Constitution.</P>
      <P>This is a very sensitive issue and not just for women. Those who claim men have no right to speak on an issue are very often the people who complain that men are not involved in family matters including the rearing and education of their children. I am not suggesting that I am the greatest father in the world &ndash; I am not. However, we are all members of society and we all have a right to our views on this matter, although I accept it fundamentally affects women. When women face crisis pregnancies one would like to think the men involved would be supportive, but sadly in some cases they are not.</P>
      <P>The Government is setting up an agency to deal with crisis pregnancies. This proves the issue is being dealt with in a very broad comprehensive way by Government. I hope the debate will be calm and this legislation and the referendum will be passed. If so I think it will settle matters for the next 20 to 25 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 2 October when the Government very unexpectedly published this legislation, I have been beset with a variety of emotions. My first emotions were anger, annoyance and frustration that the Government was to put us through the difficulties of having another referendum, given that the country has spoken twice, in 1983 and in 1992.</P>
      <P>I moved on to fear and emotion for those women who would be talked about in a way that we have heard already in the House today and will continue to hear as this debate progresses. These are women who every day either make the lonely journey to England to have an abortion or make the decision to keep a pregnancy that may cause them huge difficulty. These include pregnancies caused perhaps by rape, incest or some other horrendous action and possibly influenced by their own mental infirmity.</P>
      <P>Today, as I listened to some of the contributions in the House, I have moved back to a sense of anger. We do not need another referendum on this issue. I quote no higher authority than the Taoiseach in answer to a question from Deputy Michael Noonan, &ldquo;This does not mean that unborn human life as protected in the Constitution has been reduced as regards its scope&rdquo;. If that is the Taoiseach's opinion, why are we having another referendum? We are doing so because the Government made up of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats was not satisfied by the answer given by the people in 1992 and it wants to go back &ndash; repeatedly if necessary &ndash; until it gets the answer it wants from the people. How insulting is that to the people?</P>
      <P>Deputy Noel Ahern said the people had the right to speak, and I agree. In 1992 the electorate faced three referenda. The people did not blindly vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all three. They made targeted decisions on each issue. They agreed with the right to travel and information but disagreed with the rolling back of the Supreme Court decision on the X case. They made that decision and Deputy Ahern should not shake his head. What he is saying is if the Government puts the question in some other way, it will get the answer it wants and that the people were foolish and did not know what they were being asked. They knew what they were being asked and they said they did not want our laws to roll back the decision made where a 14 year old girl, as a result of rape, was suicidal and got the help she required from the courts. I say shame on this Government for going back on what the people said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am angry today because what we are being asked to do is wrong primarily for that reason, but also for many other reasons. This is a cynical hypocritical exercise by the Government. It is merely political expediency to bring forth this mishmash of a constitutional referendum tied in with legislation that will tie the hands of us as elected representatives. The answers to the questions posed by my party leader are full of vague expressions, such as, &ldquo;it is hoped&rdquo; and &ldquo;it is anticipated&rdquo;. In his speech today the Minister <Col N="73" /> used similar language. The Government does not know, yet it is asking the House to pass this Bill.</P>
    <P>At the Government's press launch, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, said: &ldquo;I believe our debate should be proportionate&rdquo;. It was a plea to us not to highlight the about turn by the Progressive Democrats. She went on to say: &ldquo;Let it be proportionate, particularly in the context of the grave international situation we are currently facing&rdquo;. God forgive me for being reminded of what happened in the House of Commons where a Government adviser recommended that any bad news be made public while people were exercised with the atrocities in America. This issue has nothing to do with the international situation.</P>
    <P>In her address at the Government press launch the Minister of State went on to state: &ldquo;The legislation seeks to reach out to the consensus of the middle ground and, in our view, has the capacity to garner the support of reasonably minded people&rdquo;. There is no mention of it seeking to assist women or to resolve legislative lacunae, rather she acknowledges the Government is seeking to get rid of the issue, not because it is proper to do so or because it has found the right formula by which to proceed but because it hopes to garner enough support from reasonably minded people.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the Government press launch, the Minister for Health and Children stated: &ldquo;We have considered ways of moving forward which can command the support of the people&rdquo;. The job of the Government is to do what is right, not to proceed on the basis of having its proposals passed by a percentage of the electorate. It should put what it considers to be right before the people and should act only on that basis. It should not act on the basis of support it may get or on the basis that it will win brownie points because it has succeeded in amending the Constitution. I am very angry at the Government's cynicism.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government is acting because four Independent Deputies have demanded it. They are part of a motley crew, some of whom have acted with the best of intentions. Since 1983 they have continued to demand referenda until they get the answer they want, which does not include the saving of women's lives. Regardless of what some may say, when pregnant women are treated for a medical condition the foetus may die. The secondary effect of the treatment is an abortion and let us not pretend otherwise. The doctors and the Government are aware of the position.</P>
    <P>Some of that same motley crew gave very bad advice in 1983 and ended up with the opposite of what they intended. What they sought then was unnecessary. There was never a need for Article 40.3.3º in the Constitution, as human life, born or unborn, was sufficiently protected by the Constitution and by our laws. Some of these people now say that this proposal is the right approach &ndash; some have yet to say it publicly &ndash; and the <Col N="74" /> Government has listened to them. The only concern is to garner their support.</P>
    <P>The removal of the threat of suicide as a ground for seeking an abortion, which the people decided they wanted to retain, is similar to society telling women that their bodies are divided at the neck. If implemented, this proposal will mean that women can seek medical treatment when their bodies require it but if their mental condition is suicidal they will have no rights. That is the most serious insult in the Bill. Four women Deputies are present in the House and I am surprised the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, could allow this to happen. The Government is proposing to give women who are suicidal, like the girl in the X case, two options: they can commit suicide or travel to England in their suicidal condition and make the necessary arrangements to have an abortion. It is tantamount to saying that society only wants to help women if their bodies are ill, not if they are mentally ill and that illness causes as much danger to life as, say, a carcinoma on the uterus. This is the most callous aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a gross insult to the profession of psychiatry. As elsewhere, psychiatrists in this country must undergo training and qualification as doctors. I am surprised the psychiatric profession has not been louder regarding the insult heaped upon it. In response to a question from Deputy Noonan, the Taoiseach advises that the only reason suicide is being removed as a reason for seeking an abortion is because it would require the establishment of a mechanism where psychiatrists would give advice on the suicidal condition of a woman and if that were included it would lead to what he terms &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo;. How did the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, allow such a term to creep into speeches by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and other Members on the Government side of the House? It suggests that because women want to improve their figure to fit a new dress they will seek an abortion. My colleague, Senator Keogh, put it more graphically yesterday when she said it suggested that women might seek a &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; between painting their nails and having their hair done.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as a social abortion. Women have abortions because they find themselves with unwanted pregnancies for all kinds of reasons but it is not because of social reasons, such as a social outing with work colleagues or embarking on a social trip to Liverpool to experience the new boat service from Dún Laoghaire. It is an offensive term and, as a woman, I am ashamed that any other woman, in this House or elsewhere, would allow the Government to accuse a suicidal woman, who might have to seek help from the courts to terminate her pregnancy, of allowing for the introduction of social abortion to this country. It is another reason I am so angry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> However, I reserve my highest level of anger and cynicism for the Progressive Democrats, especially in view of speeches made by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, and the Attorney General, Mr. McDowell, when he was a Member of this House. In his present role as Attorney General former Deputy McDowell is the chief legal adviser to the Government. I am appalled he would sanction the introduction of legislation such as this, which, as Deputy Dukes said, will fetter the Members of the House now and in the future. The courts have called on the Oireachtas to introduce legislation but if the Attorney General were a Member of this House he would be incandescent with rage if he thought a Government was removing his right to introduce legislation to this House. Yet, as Attorney General, he is recommending to the Government to do that.</P>
    <P>In response to a question from Deputy Noonan, the Taoiseach says it would <i>intra vires</i> introduce legislation. This means that we, the Members elected by the people, need the protection of the Constitution to tell us what legislation to introduce. How dare he. In 1995, when speaking on the legislation dealing with the right to information on abortion services, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who was then an Opposition spokesperson for her party, said: &ldquo;We will also table an amendment to take account of the X case, the hard cases and the rights of women for whom a pregnancy poses a risk to their lives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Michael McDowell said, &ldquo;I completely reject the notion that any female is obliged to carry a pregnancy to a full term where conception was based on rape, incest or sexual abuse of a child.&rdquo;  My, how he has changed his tune. What care and concern does he have for the female obliged to carry a pregnancy for those reasons now? It has all gone out the window because of his pursuit of power and desire to be Attorney General and give the Government the advice he thinks will suit it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, made some other choice comments in 1995. Talking about the X case she said, &ldquo;The further the facts of this case slip from our memory, the easier it is for the old absolutes to revive and gain credence.&rdquo; How right she was and how easily she has forgotten she said that. She further said:</P>
    <P>The bringing of the X case marked an all-time low in the treatment of women with crisis pregnancies. It was perhaps the most shameful and disgraceful period in Irish public life since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>How she has forgotten that. She is the Minister of State out there selling the Progressive Democrats line. In 1995, speaking in the Dáil, she reminded us:</P>
    <P>There are interest groups at work in our society, powerful, secretive, manipulative and extremely well-funded interest groups, who will <Col N="76" /> spy on them [the doctors] and perhaps present as <i>agent provocateurs</i> in surgeries to try to trap doctors into making a recommendation which they believe is not truthful or objective.</P>
    <P>Those were her words in 1995, yet she now has the cheek to tell us she would like the debate to be proportionate. She would like it to be proportionate because she does not want us to remind her of what she said in 1995 out of care for women with unwanted pregnancies. Her sin in what she is doing now is the greatest of all because she is a woman &ndash; like many of us in the House &ndash; and has gone back on all she said. Both she and the Attorney General are people to whom the public will express its anger when it gets the opportunity to vote on this Bill.</P>
    <P>My anger was beginning to subside until I received a copy of the Taoiseach's replies to questions posed by Deputy Noonan. They are full of inconsistencies. He says it is not proposed to interpret or redefine the term &ldquo;unborn.&rdquo;  In a document distributed to the media when the Bill was being launched the Taoiseach said the term &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; was being redefined. The Government is not redefining &ldquo;unborn,&rdquo; but is defining when an abortion can take place, from conception, in one instance, and only after implantation in another. If it is not redefining the term &ldquo;unborn,&rdquo; I do not know what it is doing. The unborn are not worthy of protection at conception, they are only worthy of it after implantation. What nonsense and twisting on the head of a pin that is. I cannot understand this. The Taoiseach says the Government's proposals will result &ldquo;it is hoped&rdquo; in the enactment of a law which is clear as to its meaning and effects.</P>
    <P>In the light of Deputy Noonan's question, how is it anticipated that the Government's proposals will impinge on the rights of the unborn and the mother, which are already identified? It will not. It simply makes it constitutionally <i>ultra vires</i> for us to pass laws. That is no big deal and it shows the arrogance of the Attorney General that he would allow a Government to put that into law. At the same time the right of the constitutional office of the President to refer legislation to the courts, if he or she thinks it unconstitutional, is removed. The Taoiseach's answer regarding the definition of the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; is as follows, &ldquo;The envisaged legislation, the terms of which are set out in the Second Schedule, defines the term &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; for the purpose of that legislation only&rdquo;. Think of the fun the Supreme Court will have. There will be one definition in one Act and another referring to another law only. The court will have to make its decisions based on this.</P>
    <P>In answer to question No. 8, the Taoiseach said it is far too difficult to deal with many of the issues because they are subject to philosophical, moral and theological discourse. For God's sake, <Col N="77" /> most of our theologians are men and, in many instances, members of the Church.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>They exclude women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>They exclude women and will never have to face the unwanted pregnancy of a partner, or should not as they are not meant to.</P>
      <P>By referring to philosophical, moral and theological discourse the Taoiseach is saying that this will be based on the considerations of those who have no right to make pronouncements on the pregnancies and unwanted pregnancies of women. The Government wants to put into the Constitution a provision which could be made, as Deputy Dukes said, by amending the 1861 Act or by introducing legislation <i>ab initio</i> in the Dáil for Members to discuss and amend as they see fit.</P>
      <P>In deference to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who is a doctor I will finish with a hypothesis. Can one imagine the outcry if we decided to legislate in this Bill for the operation of a vasectomy? If a man has a vasectomy, he is preventing a pregnancy from taking place. If the argument is stretched enough, it can be said that is an abortifacient operation because it is designed to prevent a man's sperm from managing to impregnate an ovum in a woman. If legislation were put in place regarding scrotum cancer which ruled that if a man had chemotherapy on his scrotum it would prevent him producing sperm and interfere with procreation, I can imagine the outcry. Imagine that was provided for not mere in legislation, but in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government should hang their heads in shame and tell the women they are appearing to try to help that they will give them what assistance they can to prevent crisis pregnancies. The Government should give them all the advice it can instead of treating them like idiots and dividing their bodies into two parts above and below the neck.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will not get any debate from me if she keeps interrupting.</P>
      <P>There can be very few issues facing any society that are as complex and challenging as the issue of abortion. In 1983 it was felt the people had put into the Constitution a clear and unambiguous statement providing protection for the life of the unborn, but that view was wrong. Within a few short years the Supreme Court completely reversed the generally accepted interpretation of the referendum result of 1983. With the X case and the subsequent C case further ambiguity was created. Therefore, it is incumbent on us, as a society, to address those ambiguities with the questions raised by those cases. The question of abortion is one on which there is no middle ground. It is by its very nature a divisive issue, one invariably discussed in emotional terms. Inevitably, those on either side of the debate try to demonise, misrepresent and shout down the opposing view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two diametrically opposed views, which deserve to be heard. Whatever else can be said about the current proposals, the point cannot be made legitimately that there has been any shortage of discussion of the issue in the past 15 years. We have had four and a half years of dis<Col N="79" /> cussion and analysis, along with a Green Paper and a report from an all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution, which considered a vast number of separate submissions. There is no excuse for politicians who do not know where we stand on the issue of abortion. There is no excuse for equivocation.</P>
    <P>There has not been a shortage of analysis and it is therefore surprising that a party with such a long and distinguished history as Fine Gael should seek to put the issue on the long finger. I cannot understand it.</P>

      <P>Immediately following the general election the Taoiseach promised a referendum to be held during the lifetime of the current Dáil. He is now honouring that promise.</P>
      <P>In spite of the cynicism of the past four years it is astonishing that there has been some criticism of the fact that the Taoiseach has had the political courage to produce a comprehensive set of proposals at this time. It may be that others have better propositions in mind. If so, let them put them before us and we will listen to them.</P>
      <P>The proposals that have been published are comprehensive and compassionate. They afford the Irish people a further opportunity to make a clear and unambiguous statement as to where they stand on this most difficult issue. In addition to affording the people this opportunity, we are also challenging the people with these proposals, because they go further than previous propositions. They are not as simplistic as previous approaches, but complex. We all have to accept that.</P>
      <P>There is no single one-liner that will deal with this complex set of issues. I do not claim to have wisdom in abundance, and I may be wrong, but I do not believe that suggestions that the matter can be resolved by reverting to Victorian legislation and making some adjustments to it are of any worth. This would not be sufficient to return the Irish people to the position we believed we were in after 1983.</P>
      <P>In 1992, the Supreme Court in the X case ruled that the termination of pregnancy was lawful in this country when there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother. In other words, it introduced the issue of suicide. It is a very difficult issue to argue against. I accept that. All the arguments that have been put forward should be based on reason rather than emotion. Ultimately, some decision will have to be made on this issue. There is no option and no room for equivocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judgment in the X case introduced an extraordinary interpretation of what had been enacted by the Irish people as a pro-life constitutional amendment. Whether we agree or not with the amendment of 1983 is not the issue. The <Col N="81" /> Irish people in 1983 sought to include in their Constitution a provision to protect the life of the unborn child. Due to legal imperfections in the drafting &ndash; that is widely accepted by all sides in the argument&mdash;</P>

I do not come to the House to represent people who want to hide between equivocation and mud-stirring. I come to listen to the Deputy and put my points on the record and I hope that she will listen to me.</P>
      <P>To answer the last contributor, a referendum was held in 1992 in response to the High Court decision. It sought to provide for the termination of pregnancy if there was a real, substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother. We know the result of this referendum.</P>
      <P>We are currently faced with an extraordinary situation here. On the one hand, we have the expressed wish of the people that our Constitution should be unequivocally pro-life. On the other hand, as a result of the judgment and the failure of legislators to deal with the issue, not just in this Dáil but in previous Dáils, we could theoretically have had widely available abortion in the country without any kind of regulation. That is a fact. The only thing protecting the people from having an abortion system more open than anywhere else in the world &ndash; I was almost going to use the term &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; but there is nothing liberal about abortion &ndash; is the ethical standard being applied by the medical profession. However, that is not good enough. We need finality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea that, somehow or other, the issue can be avoided seems to be the most dangerous approach of all. I have some respect for people in the Labour Party who have said they are pro-choice and in favour of abortion on demand. I do not agree with that policy but I respect their right to put it forward. I cannot understand or respect people who want to do the same, but will not, and <Col N="82" /> people who are pro-life, but are frightened to say so. We must come down from the fence and make decisions.</P>
    <P>As the Members know, following the election of 1997, the Taoiseach indicated that a Green Paper would be published after he took up office. It was published is September 1999. On publication it was referred to the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution. There was significant cynicism about that at the time and a great deal of criticism. There were many suggestions to the effect that we should have handled the issue shortly after the Green Paper but that, somehow, the Government ducked the issue by referring it to the joint committee.</P>
    <P>That committee did an extraordinarily good job. I regret that there could not be solutions at the end but, given the nature of an all-party committee, that was always going to be the way. The committee conducted the most elaborate and comprehensive consultation process ever seen in the history of the nation. In all, more than 100,000 submissions were received from various organisations and individuals. At that stage the cynics said there should be some decision in this matter to give it finality. When there was a further protracted process of consultation with people before the report was published, that was also criticised. However, the approach taken by the joint committee was the right one. It allowed people to talk through the various sides of the argument and provided much more light and much less heat than some of what passes for political debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>The joint committee published its report on 15 November 2000 and again the cynics and critics asked the Government why it did not produce a response. The current proposal is based on the work of the joint committee. The Government examined the three possible approaches suggested by the committee and devised a very complex response which, nonetheless, is the only option which can be availed of and, I point out to political critics, the only one on offer.</P>
    <P>All sides of the House have had more than adequate time to consider the complexities, ambiguities and dangers which have arisen as a result of the X case, and all have failed to date to address them.</P>

      <P>The proposals offer the people the opportunity to revisit the debate we had in the middle of the 1980s. The people will either accept or reject these proposals and we will then know <Col N="83" /> finally where we stand as a nation. The amendment creates a basis for the legislative protection of human life in pregnancy. That is one of the ambiguities which existed in law in this State since the X case. The legislation will ensure the maximum degree of protection for the unborn child is provided. It will at the same time ensure a pregnant woman will receive any necessary medical treatment to protect her life. A key element of the approach adopted is that the electorate will be given the opportunity before the constitutional amendment is made to review the legislation which is necessary and which the courts have pointed out as being necessary.</P>
      <P>I say to Deputies who have asked about tying the hands of the House that this is not a sovereign Legislature. I do not understand how Members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann could exist under the delusion that it is. Bunreacht na hÉireann makes it abundantly clear to anyone who takes even a casual moment to peruse it that the only sovereign authority in the land is the people.

      <P>I will try. Deputy Roche is correct. Abortion is a difficult and sensitive issue which is difficult to deal with and is difficult for women, their families, the Church, legislators and definitely Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I was referring to the Deputy as the legislator. I wish the motivation for this referendum came from a source other than a handful of Independents and a few others. Nevertheless, I accept the Government's bona fides in that what we have before us is its honest and best effort to deal with an issue which has been unresolved for almost 20 years. What Deputy Roche said is correct. A great deal of work has gone into producing a package which, on the face of it, appears to give a little to both sides of the argument in the hope of achieving a consensus and, if not that, a sufficient majority to put this matter away for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>However, it is not the rights given in the proposal which are material to the outcome but those taken away. What is material for me is the proposal to reduce the right to life of women, to ask me to legislate for it and to invite women and their sons, fathers, boyfriends and brothers to vote to confirm a lesser right to life for women than they enjoy and have enjoyed under the Constitution for the past ten years and for which they voted.</P>

      <P>I am fundamentally opposed to such a proposal and I find it almost impossible to believe that in the 21st century we are being asked to consider it. This is a view which is shared by many. I hope that is clear enough for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am conscious that there are many, among them my close friends, who hold a diametrically opposed view, that these views are validly and fervently held, and for these reasons I, too, would like this debated in as rational, non-confrontational, non-judgmental and sensitive a manner as possible. I am old enough to remember vividly the debates in the 1980s and 1990s with their excesses and do not want to live through them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly conscious, as I was then, that there are between 100,000 and 200,000 women living in Ireland who made the lonely choice to have an abortion, many of them little more than children themselves. Many made the journey to England alone, in secret, confiding in no one and without the support of their families or friends. They have lived, often for many years, with that <Col N="86" /> secret because it is still a taboo subject, and now we are trying to make it a criminal one.</P>

      <P>We do not know who those women are, but they are out there and they listen to our utterances, which they view as judgment on them. If we keep this to the forefront of our minds it will help us to be sensitive and rational.</P>
      <P>I do not seek to persuade others to my point of view on the substantive issue, not just because I know that I will not succeed but because I do not believe that I should try as it is a matter of personal belief. However, I question strongly the way in which it is proposed to deal with the issue, that is by way of legislation which is to become part of the Constitution. I do so, not on behalf of those who share my view, but on behalf of both sides of the divide since this process is as flawed for one side as the other.</P>
      <P>At the time of the first referendum, there were endless debates about the wording, as Deputy Roche stated, and we were assured by much the same people who now assure us at the third referendum that the wording would forever prevent abortion here. However, it was that wording which was interpreted to introduce legal abortion. Then we added one sentence to the Constitution and yet we got it wrong. We all misjudged it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that it meant something different from what the majority of the public meant. If there is such potential in one sentence, then what is the potential to get it wrong in an entire Bill which will become an integral part of an immutable Constitution? It is a folly beyond words because every section, sentence and clause will be liable to challenge. Challenges will not be adjudicated on by the people nor those elected to legislate but by the Supreme Court. As sure as night follows day, some of these interpretations will not be what is envisaged now nor what was intended by the Oireachtas and the people. The legislature will be able to do nothing <Col N="87" /> short of frequently going back to the public to rectify the mistakes of the previous referendum.</P>
      <P>We make mistakes in legislation. Many Bills before the House are amendments to previous Bills and Bills are repealed, replaced, adjusted and expanded. We do it every day, either because we got it wrong in the first place, circumstances change or our thinking evolves. In this case, we will not be able to amend it as there will be no such room for manoeuvre.</P>
      <P>Transposing an entire Bill into the Constitution has never been done before, and with good reason. It is a dangerous precedent to vote away our rights and responsibilities to amend legislation. If we had good reason not to do so before, why do we dream of doing it for the first time in an area as fraught and complex as abortion where we got it wrong once, and many would claim twice? Deputy Noonan's questions flushed out many areas ripe for challenge in the courts and there are, I am sure, others which we cannot guess at. However, they are there in the ambiguities and interpretations to which almost every clause in the Bill is subject.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Taoiseach's responses, I will highlight some. The new Constitution would offer additional protection to the existing right of the unborn, but only after implantation. I understand the practical reason implantation was chosen as the measurable and knowable point when destruction becomes a criminal offence, but if the Taoiseach thinks that these different protections offered at different points of life will not be used as the basis for a challenge to the use of the IUD and morning after pill, he is wrong. He is offering a hostage to fortune.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan raised the question of a suicidal minor in a health board's care and her right to travel abroad under the new proposal in circumstances similar to the C case. The Taoiseach gave an ambiguous reply which referred to a woman, while the question was about a minor. Even if this was not a fudge, the Taoiseach cannot categorically state that a minor's right to travel outside the State is assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be up to the Taoiseach to decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts will decide. A case like this will be challenged and a court will not be able to respond as in the C case, because at that time abortion was legal. Now it will be criminal as well as unavailable. It will be a brave health board that tries to defend a situation where they would spend taxpayers' money on a service abroad which is a criminal offence in Ireland. No health board would even try. The impact of this proposal will be &ldquo;tough luck&rdquo; to the next C case, <Col N="88" /> the mentally handicapped and the rape or incest child victim in the State's care.</P>
      <P>The kind of thinking behind these proposals is manifest in the Taoiseach's reply and the Minister's speech. It is instructive to read the Taoiseach's replies to Deputy Noonan's questions. I wish that the public would read them. Fine Gael sought more information because if this Bill becomes part of the Constitution we want clarity about what is being proposed and why, what impact it will have and on whom. The nub of this proposal is rolling back on the X case. Everything else in it can be achieved through legislation alone. Only this measure requires a constitutional referendum and, therefore, there must be no ambiguity about what it means. All of us here remember the X case and we know that it established a woman's right to an abortion where the continuation of her pregnancy represented a threat to the life of the mother, including suicide. In other words, it encompassed the threat to life from severe physical or mental illness.</P>
      <P>Since that case was hotly debated, a new generation of boys and girls has grown up who may not fully comprehend what we are about now. Before voting, every woman, her brother, father and boyfriend must know what is proposed, that is, that women will have a lesser right to life than they currently have and which, as a nation, we voted for ten years ago. This is a decision of monumental proportions. In effect it says that suicide is less serious, less grievous and more preferable than abortion. Is this the view of the people and, if not, why is it proposed to put it into the Constitution? Again, the Taoiseach's reply gives us some clue. He said: &ldquo;If legal provision were made for suicide risk, a system of psychiatric assessment and court supervision would almost inevitably follow&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>So what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What he seems to be saying is either psychiatrists can diagnose a suicide risk or we cannot trust them not to invent a diagnosis. Yet an ordinary doctor looking after her physical health can recommend an abortion based on nothing more than &ldquo;reasonable opinion&rdquo; formed in good faith. Apparently no number of specialist psychiatrists could make a similar assessment of the risk to life. I am perfectly sure psychiatrists can and do misdiagnose but I am equally certain that doctors do so every day. If we are to look for the real reason for the dropping of the suicide provision we must look further into the Taoiseach's remarks, and again this one is instructive &ndash; allowing for abortion &ldquo;where suicide is threatened by a pregnant woman would start an unstoppable slide towards social abortion&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Government thinks about women. I am sure neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister intends to <Col N="89" /> be insulting to women but where did they get the idea that women are hell bent on destruction and death? From where did this idea come? What happened to the notion of the woman as the caring person, the nurturer? The Minister said this morning; &ldquo;The only real defence against widespread abuse of the X case as a basis for social abortion in Ireland is the ethical consensus in the medical profession&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is another quote: &ldquo;A small number of exceptional cases can be exploited to allow a widescale application of abortion&rdquo;. How can we trust them with anything? While I cannot find the reference, the same applies to new drugs coming on the market. There appears to be a fear that women might get their hands on them and they cause abortion. Instead of banning the drugs we are putting a ban into the Constitution. The name of the Bill is insulting, part of which reads: Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy. Who protects life more than women? Who has done it through the ages since the beginning of time? That type of language is insulting and my colleagues have referred to this insult.</P>
      <P>To suggest social abortion exists is to completely misunderstand not just women but human nature and, in fact, nature. Everything in a woman's psyche, her makeup, drives and motivates her to guard, protect, nourish and nurture her child inside and outside the womb until the day she dies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an inescapable biological imperative. When a woman makes a choice to have an abortion it is because she considers it is the only choice. It is always and in every circumstance an act of desperation. I have heard women try to minimise the enormity of that decision but to them in their hearts it is an act of desperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To remove the real threat of suicide as a condition for allowing abortion because of the fear of a possible slide towards social abortion is based on a totally false premise, because there simply is no such thing as a social abortion. Currently, an independent woman of means can, even in her desperation, go to London, albeit alone and secretly, but she has some comfort in knowing that she is seeking a service which is, at least, legal in her own country. It may not be available in her <Col N="90" /> own country but at least it is legal. This proposal, if passed, would not stop a single such woman from having an abortion. She will still go secretly and alone but with the added burden of having a taint of criminality and the public voted condemnation of her fellow countrymen and women.</P>
    <P>We have been accused both by ourselves and others of being hypocritical. Rather than face up to the problem we have been hypocritical in allowing our problems to be exported to Britain. What is happening now is much better than what is being proposed. I do not pretend it is the ideal circumstance but, at least, it offers legislators some room for manoeuvre when further hard cases arise, such as the X and C cases, whereas what is proposed does not leave any. The courts can interpret but the legislator cannot subsequently amend. What we have now is an extraordinary position whereby medical practice may change and so change the circumstances in which abortions are permitted, Ministers may increase or decrease the venues or locations where abortions can take place, any member of the public can challenge the provisions of the Constitution, including any changes resulting from medical or ministerial changes of practice over time, and judges can adjudicate on these. The only group left in the democracy who has no input whatsoever is the Parliament. Does this make any sense? This is a seriously flawed process. I ask Members and anybody listening to think long and hard before voting to tie our hands for ever because we will regret it and many women will live to regret it.</P>

      <P>Even today politicians are running a mile from this debate. That is clear from the number of Deputies who are present and those listed to speak. That is not a criticism of those present but of those who decided they do not wish to participate. Many commentators have described the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill as a relatively conservative proposal. Perhaps they are right. I acknowledge that Deputy Mitchell had the courage to put her position on the record which is more than many have done. As she said, if the Constitution is amended, as outlined in the Bill, it will mean a rolling back of the position in the X case where the Supreme Court ruled that if it was established as a matter of probability that a real and substantial risk could be averted by the termination of a pregnancy, such a termination was lawful. The stated risk to the mother's life in this case arose because she had threatened to commit suicide if she had to continue with the pregnancy. As I understand it, this judgment means that abortion has been lawful in the State since 1992 in certain limited circumstances and if the constitutional amendment is passed that will no longer be possible. People should know that. Those listening to us should know what is being put to them. We are upfront in this Bill and in the announcements made that this will be the effect of the consti<Col N="91" /> tutional amendment. People should know what they are voting for.</P>

      <P>I am putting it on the record so that whoever happens to be listening will know it. The Government has stated that also. After the 1992 Supreme Court decision, three proposals were put to the people and they have been mentioned several times. The issues of travel and information were dealt with by amendments and the people decided in their wisdom that they wanted women to have the right to travel and the right to information. What was termed the &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; was rejected by the voters and was ignored by successive Governments. Nine years later, this is the first attempt to address the substantive issue.

      <P>&mdash;in the wake of the X case. What Deputy Owen says is fine, but nobody chose to act.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus made a passionate plea concerning a young woman who was raped, became suicidal and did not want to continue with her pregnancy. Again, Deputy Olivia Mitchell flagged the point in relation to this which is a cause of concern to me. I would like clarification on the C case, which involved a minor in the care of a health board which decided to seek consent for her to travel abroad for a termination. I fully understand the implications of the X case, but I am not sure about those of the C case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young woman to whom Deputy McManus referred and those involved in the X and C cases have simply become statistics and are seen merely as being among the 6,000 plus women who travel to Britain for abortions each year. Deputy Dukes took the Government to task and stated that its response to this woman and all others who find themselves in such circumstances was to tell them to go to Britain. However, he and other members of his party have failed to indicate what is Fine Gael's response to the young woman in question. If we are to judge from the amendment to the Bill tabled by Fine Gael, that party is saying we should defer a decision for three months until the matter can be considered further in a legal sense. The view of the majority of the Fine Gael Members on the All-Party Committee on the <Col N="92" /> Constitution in relation to the X case was that we should do nothing.</P>

      <P>Deputy McManus correctly pointed out that the floodgates did not open after 1992. There was a fear that, after the Supreme Court judgment, women would rush to the courts and demand their legal right to an abortion in this country. However, that did not happen and, to my knowledge, there has not been one case where a woman demanded that legal right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy McManus did not indicate was the reason no woman has demanded the legal right to a termination or abortion in this country on the basis that she was pregnant and suicidal. That issue was not addressed in any of the consultations in which the all-party committee engaged or in the documents that have been produced.</P>
      <P>Even given the legal right of a woman to have an abortion in this country since 1992, why have women decided to travel to Britain? The answer has a great deal to do with the society in which we live and it has not been addressed. Most of the case studies of women in crisis pregnancy refer to the fear experienced by these women. Society has not changed dramatically since the 1920s and 1930s when women went away to have babies and returned home alone.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the practical problems is that there is no place in Ireland where a woman can legally secure an abortion. When the masters of the main maternity hospitals made their presentations to the all-party committee, they informed us that, even if the people decided not to roll back the decision in the X case, they would not provide abortions, as defined in the Bill, in their hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Until we introduce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I understood them to say that procedures described in the legislation as abortions will not be carried out in the main maternity hospitals. In that context, people should be informed about the implications of our choosing a particular route to take on this issue. <Col N="94" /> In my opinion, we will be facing the prospect of the establishment of abortion clinics in Ireland. I understand, from the presentations that were made, that a woman who is legally entitled to abortion under the regime that has existed since 1992 could do so. Let us inform the people that this is what is involved and if that is acceptable to them they should vote accordingly.</P>
      <P>Another reason women travel to Britain is to be found in the book, <i>Women in Crisis Pregnancy</i>. It is stated on page 335 that the journey to England was always difficult and women would be scared that they would be seen. One young woman stated: &ldquo;You have to tell so many lies because you're coming over. It was tricky. Even going to the airport I was looking around me thinking, everybody knows where I'm going. You know, you're paranoid and everything. It was just how I felt&rdquo;. Do Members believe that the hundreds of women interviewed for that book would feel less obvious and more comfortable going to an abortion clinic in Ireland?</P>

    <P>I support Deputy Olivia Mitchell's request that anyone participating in the debate, inside or outside the House, should take account of the feelings of the women who have had that experience. Everything we say and the way in which we approach this matter can and will cause hurt. The fact that we are discussing the issue of abortion again will cause every woman who has an abortion to undergo some form of trauma and to relive the experience. Whatever <Col N="95" /> we do, even if it is only Deputy Roche screaming across the Chamber at Deputy Owen, it belittles no-one to agree that insensitive language can hurt women who have experienced abortion.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of that. As a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution I had the opportunity to participate in the process of consultation which was very worthwhile. We had had the Green Paper, but it was at our request that the doctors of the main maternity hospitals came in, though I am open to correction on that. We had all the interested groups in and there were 100,000 submissions. The obvious groups came in to make their position known and with one exception they made their case in a balanced, fair and passionate way. I exclude Youth Defence and give full credit to Deputy Brian Lenihan, who chaired the committee, for handling it well. I would nearly urge it to butt out and stay away from this. It certainly did not advance its cause at the hearings and did not do itself any justice. The approach of those from all sides who came in to argue the pro-life and pro-choice cases, whatever one wants to call them, was balanced, reasonable and measured. It was not the frenzy we remember from the previous referendum.</P>
      <P>The medical practitioners came in at the request of the committee to make presentations. Up to that point, having supported the first constitutional referendum, I do not know whose wording it was, I just knew that at that point in my life&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> I have had the benefit of three successful births without any problems. One does not realise or understand the kind of difficulties maternity hospitals must deal with on a daily basis and how they protect lives while ensuring mothers and children go home safely. The practitioners concerned pointed out that this was not as simple as people attempted to suggest. I do not want to be confrontational, but it is relevant that they felt they had been left without the legal protection of the House under various Governments in carrying out procedures necessary to save the lives of mothers. We left them stranded. I do not have the transcripts, but that is on the record. They felt there was a possibility they were operating outside the law. Those were the words of one of the masters of the main maternity hospitals. They felt we had left them exposed legally because of the uncertainty as to whether, legally, they were allowed to provide women with necessary medical care.</P>
    <P>We are talking emotionally about rolling back and refusing a suicidal woman the right to an abortion, but we also left hundreds of thousands of women at risk because we sat on our hands and did nothing. We said: &ldquo;The medical profession will deal with that and hopefully it will not end in court&rdquo; and that is what we all did. We did not move too fast when it was needed.</P>
    <P>I know the reason it has been said that this is a rerun of the 1992 referendum, but I disagree. I know people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; on what was described as the substantive issue, as all Members do. There were two main reasons. One was that those who voted against it, just as is the case today, believed it was wrong to remove the suicide option. Equally &ndash; I note my feelings of the time &ndash; women believed that that particular amendment decreased the amount of certainty and security they had about their own health. They felt this was going back to a situation where if the lives of both the mother and the child were at risk then the mother was going to die. That was the kind of anecdotal comment made by men and women who voted against the substantive issue in the 1992 referendum.</P>
    <P>This legislation clearly states that any medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended, where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life &ndash; that is clearly stated, which was not the case in 1992&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to say, without being smart, is that women do not have that risk and will not come second: they are not back to a position where the child's life is supreme and where they would have to die in <Col N="97" /> childbirth, if necessary. It is clearly stated that that is not the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The other issue is that for the first time we have a definition of &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;. This was stated in the Green Paper and the various medical practitioners who came to the hearings said it was necessary to define &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;. Previous speakers have referred to this in the context of dancing on the head of a pin and whether it was a necessary medical procedure or indirect. We have a definition which clarifies matters considerably.</P>
      <P>I do not have enough time to discuss the crisis pregnancy agency, but I am delighted the Minister has established it. Often there is a need to put one's money where one's mouth is and this is the one proposal for which there was total cross-party support at the review group. I commend it as it is very worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the people will decide on this issue. At least the Government has a clear position. As has been discovered, it is not acceptable to some Members and it may not be acceptable to the public, but it is a proposition. I hope Fine Gael will adopt a policy on this. Perhaps by the end of Second Stage we will know if it has a position on it as debate is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>What we need at the end of Second Stage is clarity, assurance and legal accuracy in order that we do not go back to the situation in which we have found ourselves time and again. I do not want to play the old veteran card, but I have a sense of<i> deja vu</i> and of old recordings being played again. I remind Deputy McGennis that the 1983 wording was Fianna Fáil's and it was insisted that that be retained even when medical, legal and legislative Members pointed out that it was filled with danger. The then Attorney General, Peter Sutherland, not only pointed that out, but attempted to introduce a safer wording. That is the history.</P>
      <P>To put it into perspective, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who then led Fine Gael and the Government, publicly asked people to vote against the wording. He realised from the medical and legal expertise he had received that it could place women in danger and that it could also be counterproductive to the pro-life movement which was pushing for it; it could introduce everything it was fighting against, the legalisation of abortion in the country. Lo and behold, nine years later in 1992 it all came to pass. Decent, committed people who wished nothing bad for women were appalled that that was the outcome of a measure they believed was protecting mothers and babies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we, on this side of the House, are saying please be careful. From what we see as the flaws in the proposed legislation, not only could this happen again but it could do so in a much more proportionate way. This is not a matter of <Col N="98" /> us sitting on the fence. Anybody who knows the record of most of us in this House knows that is not the case. I pay tribute to Deputy McGennis for her commitment to women on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Irish Haemophilia Society wrote to me on 6 September seeking an extension to the Lindsay Tribunal's terms of reference to enable the tribunal to investigate the actions of certain multinational pharmaceutical companies. Section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1998, provides that terms of reference can only be amended where the tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment, following consultation with the Attorney General on behalf of the relevant Minister, or where the tribunal itself has requested the amendment. Accordingly, I wrote to the Attorney General on 10 October asking him to seek the consent of Judge Lindsay to an extension of her terms of reference to facilitate: (i) a request for voluntary discovery from the pharmaceutical companies; (ii) an order for discovery against the pharmaceutical companies; (iii) procurement of documentation under US freedom of information legislation; and (iv) an application for access to the document depository in Pensacola, Florida.</P>
      <P>On 16 October the chairperson furnished a detailed response to the Attorney General in which she stated that she did not believe that it would be correct for her to consent to the suggested amendment of the terms of reference of the tribunal. A copy of the chairperson's response has been placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally it was believed that the possible closure of the document depository in Pensacola might affect the achievement of a full investigation of the pharmaceutical companies. I would like to bring the House up to date on this matter. The depository was created to ensure that all American HIV-infected haemophiliac plaintiffs had access to similar quality and volume of discovered documentation in respect of their litigation against pharmaceutical companies. It had been suggested that the depository would close with effect from 1 January 2002 and that any further applications for access would have to be made by 1 November 2001. However, solicitors for the IHS have contacted the lead counsel for <Col N="99" /> the depository, and have now informed me, by letter yesterday, that an application would need to be made as soon as practicable, but that 1 November is not a strict deadline. Assurances have been furnished that, while the documents may be moved to a different site or sites, they will not be destroyed. This has been confirmed by a US firm retained by the Attorney General's office. Lead counsel has also given an assurance to the IHS solicitors that, should the pharmaceutical companies seek the return of their documents, this will be opposed.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the concerns of people with haemophilia in Ireland, as well as the wider public, in this matter. Notwithstanding the complex legal difficulties associated with an Irish tribunal seeking to investigate entities in other jurisdictions, I am presently consulting with the Attorney General on the options available, and I will revert to the House again as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that answer was &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but the people who have suffered from haemophilia and who have been exposed to HIV and hepatitis, and their families, deserve a clearer answer than that. Therefore, I ask the Minister to come off the fence and say, even if he cannot do it now, that he will give a commitment. The Irish Haemophilia Society would accept even a commitment that he will do it in the future. That is all I am asking. Will he answer the question I asked?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Canada, where they could not compel witnesses to attend, the pharmaceutical companies did not attend but the judge read the documents and made a judgment. Is it possible for that to happen here? What is the problem with proceeding in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure the Irish Haemophilia Society would be satisfied with that. The situation, as the Deputy will be aware, goes back to even 1998, before the establishment of the present tribunal, where legal advice was obtained regarding the difficulties of moving into another jurisdiction to pursue this issue. However, I am committed to having a complete and thorough examination of that to see how best we can not only retain and keep open the Pensacola depository but proceed in terms of getting at not just those documents but other issues that have been raised with me.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I received an 11 page letter from the IHS outlining a range of other possible options ranging from the Hague Convention and the utilisation of British legislation in respect of any companies which may have operated from a British base to how one would make an application under the US Judicial Assistance Act. That Act would be the key statute in the United States which a Government would seek to use to pursue issues under a particular tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental issue, which arose in 1998 and <Col N="100" /> still arises, is the degree to which a tribunal of inquiry is, in itself, a judicative body, that is, that its conclusions are binding on people afterwards in terms of either prosecution or other actions. That said, the Attorney General and I are looking at both those options which have been put before us by the IHS and other options in terms of moving forward in a way in which the &ldquo;i&rdquo;s are dotted and the &ldquo;t&rdquo;s crossed. We will be meeting the IHS next week to put forward our proposals on the matter. I am not ruling anything in or out at this stage. What I am saying is that the original deadline, 1 November, which was reported at the time and which we were led to believe was in place, necessitated an initial response in terms of the tribunal and we sought an extension of its terms of reference to try to seek access to the Pensacola depository in the first instance. However, it seems that it may not stop at that.</P>

      <P>The Minister, as a former Lord Mayor of Cork as I am of Dublin, will be aware of the traditions which go with that office. I recall visiting Harcourt Street Hospital on Christmas Day and meeting an old friend whose child was dying from infection. Those people deserve all the support of the Government to go after these US pharmaceutical companies.

      <P>The extension of the terms of reference of the Laffoy commission referred to actions within this State in the industrial schools and it was on foot of a report we received on the vaccination trials which took place in particular industrial schools. The legislation which set up the Lindsay tribunal in 1998 obliged a Minister or, indeed, the Oireachtas to get the consent of the chairperson of the tribunal before even attempting to seek the extension of the tribunal's terms of reference. In other words, there is a legal obligation. Basically, the chairperson had the authority to decide whether an extension should take place. That was the issue there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, along with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, is currently addressing the issue of radiography staff shortages within the public health sector in the context of the provision of additional places on existing radiography courses. This has resulted in an increase of 150%, which is an additional 15 places, in the number of therapeutic radiography places in Trinity College Dublin this year and discussions are continuing regarding the provision of additional places in 2002. The Expert Group Report on Radiography Grades, published in July 2001, endorses this important step and reaffirms the need to assess the requirement to further increase student places. The report also includes a number of key recommendations to improve career structure, boost retention and promote continuing professional development.</P>
      <P>A joint union and management radiography service review is currently examining how the provision of radiotherapy services can be improved to ensure the best use of trained personnel. I am aware that a six-fold increase, that is, approximately 160, in the level of overseas recruitment has taken place over the past year to address difficulties in filling current vacancies. In order to facilitate this development, my Department is working to streamline the process of validation of foreign qualifications and is continuing to identify and address any impediments to successful recruitment.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Programme, as with many other sectors of the health services, has found it extremely difficult to recruit sufficient specialised radiographers. This shortage of staff has meant that the programme has been unable to screen women as quickly as anticipated. BreastCheck recognised this difficulty some time ago and took a number of initiatives to address this shortage, including running both national and international recruitment campaigns. This has resulted in the recruitment of additional radiographers to the programme and two-thirds of the radiographer posts within the BreastCheck programme are currently filled. BreastCheck continues to explore other recruitment possibilities and reports that the targets achieved in all other areas are exemplary in comparison with breast screening programmes in Holland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I missed something, but I asked a number of specific questions on vacant posts in the BreastCheck screening programme, in cancer services nationally and in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and in the BreastCheck service to which I did not receive an answer. I did not get an answer to the question I tabled and I would like the Minister to explain why. He must be aware there is currently a shortage of radiographers in both the screening programme and symptomatic services for women with cancer. I presume he is aware &ndash; even though he cannot answer a simple statistical ques<Col N="102" /> tion &ndash; that one in 30 women in Ireland get breast cancer, that the survival rate of Irish women is poor compared to many other countries and that screening is a vital part of the service. Will he explain to the House the incompetence in evidence in his approach whereby BreastCheck was set up, there are advertisements on a continual basis encouraging women to come forward and alerting them to the dangers, while at the same time the service which is in place is totally unable to meet the needs even of the targeted areas, apart from the areas outside those designated, for BreastCheck?</P>
      <P>I represent County Wicklow which is part of the Eastern Regional Health Board area. The women of that county still have not been invited to come forward, nor do they know when they will get an appointment. The reason always given is that there is a shortage of radiographers. Is the Minister aware that training courses in UCD for radiographers have had to be cancelled because there is not sufficient staff to pass on the skills. I find his reply very inadequate given that when the Bacon report was considering the needs of other professionals in the health service, radiography was not even included, which the Minister might explain. He said an assessment was carried out. I only recall a press release prompted by comments I made on radio that there was an assessment done on needs.</P>
      <P>When will there be a full complement of radiographers in BreastCheck? When will the women of County Wicklow get an appointment? When will women in areas outside the designated areas have a chance to avail of BreastCheck? Surely the Minister is aware that private patients who can afford to pay for these services can access screening without any difficulty and within a very reasonable time. However, vast numbers of women who do not have those means are being left in a limbo because of an insufficient number of radiographers. Will the Minister admit that the programme which was set up is inadequately staffed and has failed to deliver regardless of the excellent standard of the people working in the service.</P>

Additional places have been provided in Trinity College and the situation in UCD, where there are difficulties, is being examined.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Professor Patricia Barker, former Chairperson of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.

I am fully satisfied that the competencies of the new appointees, allied with the skills and experience of existing members, will ensure the service continues its programme of change and development. The major priority of the new chairman, the board together with the staff, is to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing environment in transfusion science in a positive and productive way that best meets the needs of our hospital services. For my part, I will ensure that necessary resources are available to the board so that its processes and procedures remain in line with the leading transfusion services internationally.</P>

      <P>To be fair to everyone concerned, there are different perspectives on this. I have placed all the correspondence in the Dáil Library and it would be prudent for the Deputy to read it in context. His paranoia with the Cork dimension is blinding him to a broader perspective on the difficulties surrounding the Blood Transfusion Service for some time. The Deputy needs to take a broader perspective rather than seeking short-term political advantage by trying to blacken those appointed from Cork and identifying them as political hacks, which they are not. I do not know their political affiliation, nor did I ask. I think it is very unfair to them as professionals. I stand over those appointments. Ultimately the Minister of the day has not just the responsibility but the right to appoint members <Col N="105" /> to a board. My judgment was correct because the issue pertaining to Cork and so on existed long before I came on the scene. I have made it very clear in parliamentary replies that there is an obligation on all concerned to try to resolve outstanding difficulties. Progress was made and I do not accept that the Cork issue was germane to what happened during the summer. Other issues took over, not least the report on human resource change and management produced by Phil Flynn and Associates. That was a contentious issue within the board and across the service and perhaps it is a more central issue in all of this.</P>

Does he agree that to do so at a time when there was an internecine dispute between Dublin and Cork about blood testing in both locations, which is still ongoing, was a bad public service? Does he agree also that he did terrible injury to the reputation of the board at a time when it needed to restore confidence and that he undermined its confidence, not for the people of Cork, Fianna Fáil or his running mates, but for his own ego? Will he confirm that the terms used in those records included what I said earlier about &ldquo;political hacks?&rdquo; Is it not a fact that the former chairperson, a distinguished professor, in her correspondence with him, said that she could no longer put up with the political hacks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the Inspector of Mental Hospitals recently to discuss his report and elicit his views about the areas of the mental health services which need improvement. The inspector has informed me that steady progress is being made across the country in the move towards an integrated, community based mental health service, but has emphasised that much remains to be done.</P>
      <P>The inspector paid particular attention in his report to the innovative service developments that have taken place in the Cavan-Monaghan mental health service. He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few mental health services in Ireland are truly innovative or willing to attempt new approaches to delivering mental health care. It is therefore refreshing to cite one example where considerable progress has been made in departing from convention. The Cavan-Monaghan mental health service has developed community outreach programmes for new patients and a rehabilitation service for those <Col N="107" /> with enduring mental illnesses in the past few years.</P>
    <P>The inspector noted that the results of the initiative were already being clearly seen in a reduction in the numbers of patients in the acute psychiatric units in both Monaghan and Cavan. I fully endorse the inspector's views on this service, and the Cavan-Monaghan model provides a most encouraging example of what can and should be achieved in a modern mental health service.</P>
    <P>A number of other welcome developments were reported by the inspector in many of the health board regions during 2000. A significant development during the year was the opening of the new acute psychiatric unit at the Mercy Hospital, Cork in April 2000, which represented a major step forward for the north Lee service. Work had also commenced on the construction of the new acute units at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny and the general hospitals at Portlaoise, Castlebar and Ennis. In the eastern regional area, the upgrading and improvement of conditions in the admission units in both St. Brendan's Hospital and St. Ita's Hospital were welcomed as was the appointment of a new consultant-led liaison psychiatric service at St. James's Hospital. Considerable expenditure had also been provided in upgrading the admission facilities in St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Community services were enhanced in a number of services. Developments included the opening of new day hospitals in Swords, County Dublin; Athy and Celbridge, County Kildare and Letterkenny, County Donegal; day centres in Balbriggan, County Dublin; Celbridge, County Kildare and Westport, County Mayo; extensive refurbishment and upgrading of community residences in the St. James's Hospital service; and the opening of supported residential accommodation in Newbridge, County Kildare; Rathdowney, County Laois; and Carndonagh and Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Concern was expressed by the inspector in his report at the lack of multidisciplinary teams in many mental health services, particularly in the area of psychology, occupational therapy and social work services. Additional resources were provided for health boards this year for the recruitment of paramedical staff for multidisciplinary teams. Many of these additional posts are now in place. However, some health boards have been experiencing problems in recruiting such professionals and a number of initiatives have been taken by my Department to deal with this issue, including the commissioning of a workforce planning study by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, increasing the number of student places in the therapy schools, and implementing the recommendations of the expert group report on various health professions. Increased availability of multidisciplinary teams around the country will serve to address the problem noted by the inspec<Col N="108" /> tor, that drug treatment was often the only treatment option available to patients.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issues of quality and efficiency, guidelines on good practice and quality assurance in mental health services were produced by the inspectorate of mental hospitals in 1998 and distributed to all service providers. Under the new Mental Health Act, signed by the President in July, the Mental Health Commission will be established to act as an independent agency to promote, foster and encourage the achievement and maintenance of high standards and good practice in the delivery of our mental health services. I hope to appoint the members of the Mental Health Commission within the next few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that while his approach to answering these questions is to highlight the few improvements that have been made, in general, the mental health service is in a diabolical state? While the inspector noted the exceptions, the Minister must agree that the current piecemeal approach to service delivery is detrimental to the well-being and recovery of people with mental illness. Outlining the Cavan-Monaghan issue highlights the problems in the rest of the country. If it can be done in two counties, why can it not be done in 26 counties? Highlighting the Cavan-Monaghan case exposed the problems elsewhere in that little development has taken place. The Minister must accept that the lack of a nursing care plan in many hospitals and acute units means that targets are not set in terms of recovery for someone with mental illness. Outside of Cavan-Monaghan, the lack of a community based multi-faceted service is totally unacceptable. Urgent action is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in a position to read out the latter half of the reply because of time constraints, but it deals with the areas of concern to which the inspector drew our attention in his report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It is important that in the national Parliament we highlight a particular service that others could emulate, but the key point about Cavan-Monaghan &ndash; the Deputy asked the reason this could not be done elsewhere &ndash; is that it came from within the existing service in a truly multidisciplinary way, with the consultant taking a team rather than a hierarchical approach to organisation of service. People have different perspectives on how to develop mental health services in various localities and many of the inspector's recommendations during the years, particularly in relation to sectorisation, have not been taken on board by professionals in certain areas. That is changing and we are moving towards a community based model, but all the partners within the service need to embrace it. There are difficulties in some areas. Industrial <Col N="109" /> relations issues, in terms of moving from institutions out into the community, have ended up in the Labour Relations Commission and are now in the Labour Court. Patients are awaiting transfers into community facilities because of these intractable IR issues which are not justified; there are particular areas in question.</P>
      <P>I accept the point about multidisciplinary teams, but the funding we put in place this year &ndash; a record increase in terms of additional funding for mental health services &ndash; is facilitating the provision of such teams. I suggest that the lack of these teams was one factor in the over-emphasis on the prescribing of medicine alone.</P>

I am not responsible for the lack of manpower planning in this area over the past 20 years in terms of only one school in many areas. In some cases we did not have any schools in terms of some of the allied health professionals. That has changed. We have put in place the policies that will bear fruit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of my predecessor, the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the National Cancer Forum established a sub-group to examine the provision of services for women with symptomatic breast disease. The sub-group was tasked with assessing the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the national breast cancer screening programme; the increase in the target population; the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening; and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> The sub-group was also asked to make recommendations to the Minister on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services; the resources required to develop these services; and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
    <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought on how the service should be developed in their region. In addition, members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
    <P>The sub-group considered that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the over-riding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival for those found to have breast cancer.</P>
    <P>When I received the report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease, I established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group met with Western Health Board officials and clinicians following which the board considered the development of specialist breast disease services and adopted a plan for this development which includes the provision of breast cancer services at Mayo General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The board's proposals for the development of symptomatic breast disease in the Western Health Board area have been the subject of extensive consideration by my Department and a number of meetings have been held with the Western Health Board to discuss same, most recently on 4 October last.</P>
    <P>I will continue to work with the board to ensure a comprehensive and coherent approach to the development of services for symptomatic breast disease in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer the question I asked. What is the difference in the service this year as compared to last year? The Minister and the Taoiseach, aided by the Fianna Fáil spin machine and their 75 spin doctors and consultants, gave an undertaking that the service would be enhanced and upgraded. Since that commitment was given last year, Deputy Kenny and I have tabled several questions. I ask the Minister to specify the difference in the service as between last year and this year. What is the hold-up in his Department? Is somebody in the <Col N="111" /> Department blocking this? Why is the money which the Minister committed not being spent, why is the service not being upgraded and what is happening? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I provided £1 million in last year's Estimate for the development of a breast cancer symptomatic centre in the Western Health Board region. Deputy Ring and others objected to the original proposal which was put forward by the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum and that, inevitably, caused some delay, despite the commitment I gave that there would be no downgrading of the facilities and services at Mayo General Hospital. In the intervening period, the health board had deliberated at length on this issue and came forward, towards the end of the summer, with proposals which are being assessed by the Department and the chief medical officer.</P>
      <P>As well as Deputy Ring, all of the Mayo public representatives have argued cogently on behalf of Castlebar, including my Department colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, Deputy Cooper-Flynn, Senator Chambers and others. We have already provided £6.4 million for improvements, under the cancer strategy, for the Western Health Board area, including Mayo, which has involved significant improvement in terms of medical oncology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology. Accordingly, there has been a very significant improvement, in recent years, in the service now available. I assure the Deputy that we are looking favourably at the proposals. We have to examine them in the context of the O'Higgins report and be satisfied that the criteria are met. The chief medical officer and others in the Department are dealing with the matter in that context. There have been meetings with the health board and I will revert to the Deputy shortly on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apology for fighting, together with my colleagues, to retain the service we had. I did not agree with the O'Higgins report, which took the typical Dublin 4 approach of concentrating the services in centres such as Dublin, Galway etc. We want to hold such little service as we have. Mayo is a big county and people have to travel long distances. Is this being blocked in the Department? We have had public protests in the west on this issue. The Taoiseach got his first real impression of the situation in the health services during his tour of the country, especially from the women of County Mayo. Is the Department taking this out on the people of County Mayo by blocking the Minister's proposal? The Minister is well aware that there is something going on in his Department and I want an answer. If it is being blocked, the Minister should deal with it and instruct the Department officials to let the Castlebar arrangements go ahead.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should stop playing politics with the issue. I know the Taoiseach was <Col N="112" /> ambushed on the way to County Mayo and that a great hoo-ha was created. That is legitimate, if people want to do that. Deputy Kenny was particularly active on the ground on the issue. The Western Health Board has examined the matter in considerable detail and has come forward with proposals. Nobody is holding it up or taking it out on anybody. That is an outrageous allegation and I assure the Deputy that there is no foundation for it.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he has taken to meet the concerns expressed by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in his report for the year ending 31 December 2000.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25518/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 2000 and acknowledge the important role the inspector plays in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In his latest report, the inspector highlights a number of areas within the mental health services which require attention. These include the extension and enhancement of multi-disciplinary teams, the provision of additional community-based residential accommodation and other community-based facilities such as day hospitals and day centres, and the further development of specialised psychiatric services for care groups, such as children and older people. It is my intention to facilitate health boards in bringing about the necessary improvements and developments identified by the inspector in his report. Capital funding of approximately £150 million is being provided for the further development of mental health services over the lifetime of the national development plan. This funding will go towards the further development of acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals and the enhancement of community based residences and facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional revenue funding of £18.64 million has been provided this year for improvements in mental health services. Priority is being given to the further development of community based mental health services, the further expansion of <Col N="113" /> child and adolescent psychiatry and the psychiatry of old age and the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on suicide. Provision has also been made for additional funding to voluntary bodies representing the interests of the users of the mental health services and their families and carers.</P>
    <P>The inspector also referred in his report to further progress on the Mental Health Bill. The new Mental Health Act was signed by the President on 8 July 2001 and provides for the independent and automatic review of each decision to detain a patient for psychiatric care and treatment and puts in place mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment provided in psychiatric in-patient facilities can be supervised and regulated. A Mental Health Commission is to be set up to act as an independent agency to raise standards and practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the rights of detained persons are protected. I hope to appoint the members of the commission within the next few months.</P>
    <P>In his report for 2000, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals notes the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric inpatient facilities, from 4,768 at the end of 1999 to 4,559 at the end of 2000. There were more than 24,000 admissions to these facilities in 2000 of which approximately 6,750 were first admissions. The proportion of patients being admitted to acute psychiatric units in general hospitals continued to increase and, in 2000, accounted for 43% of admissions. A further 13% were admitted to private hospitals. The number of involuntary admissions at approximately 2,450 remained constant at 10%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope when the Minister appoints the members of the Mental Health Commission he will not repeat what he did with the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on 28 September the Director of Schizophrenia Ireland, in a statement about the serious failings in mental health care provision, said:</P>
      <P>It is intolerable that, year after year, we must read of serious quality failings, lack of true multi-disciplinary teams and wasteful service provision. Much of the content of the inspector's report remains unchanged from previous years. It is unacceptable that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals is obliged to repeat, each year, the consistent inadequacies in the psychiatric services.</P>
      <P>Could there be any more damning comment by an independent observer than those comments by the Director of Schizophrenia Ireland? </P>

      <P>The comments and references in previous reports of the inspector are a damning indictment of Irish society and of successive Irish Governments over the past 30 years. Over the past four years, and this is a tribute to my predecessor and the budget for last year, there has been a dramatic increase in investment and a clear policy direction in terms of moving towards community based facilities. The inspector draws attention to the progress which has been made and in my subsequent meeting with him to discuss the report he said that steady progress had been made. I acknowledge that in some areas it has been slow, but we are making significant improvements in certain areas particularly in moving the new acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals. We have made significant progress in community based facilities but much more needs to be done in that area. We have made significant progress on multi-disciplinary teams but have much more to do. Perhaps the most significant constraint in this regard is our ability to attract sufficient health professionals including psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a Fine Gael proposal to provide £10 million to lead Europe in mental health research? Would he consider that would be a project worthy of being pursued, particularly in view of the fact that from 1997 to June 2001, the Government has spent in excess of £10 million on public relations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not read the proposal, but we have recently produced a fairly exciting document on health research strategy. This envisages an enhanced role for the Health Research Board in terms of funding research projects which would have international peer review. Any significant research projects for mental health should be progressed in that context. In the health boards, we need a stronger research culture than we have had in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little information available on the number and extent of women involved in prostitution in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the absence of concrete numbers the plan for women's health, which was launched in 1997, identified this group as one with special needs. It also recognised that the problems faced by women working in prostitution required a holistic approach, which focused on the full spectrum of women's health needs. Since <Col N="115" /> then my Department has supported health boards in the provision of all types of services for women where the need for such services was identified.</P>
    <P>With regard to sexual health, women can avail of treatment and support services from a number of sexually transmitted infection clinics, mainly based in larger cities. In Dublin, specific services are provided at the Women's Health Project in Baggot Street. These services include outreach services into the areas where prostitutes work, a drop-in service providing counselling, primary health care and screening for sexually transmitted infections, training and education workshops and a drug treatment service. Funding is also provided to the Ruhama project, run by a religious voluntary organisation working on the streets, who work in conjunction with the health boards in the ERHA area.</P>
    <P>During the consultation process in health boards on the national drugs strategy, which was published in May this year, little information was provided on prostitution and drug misuse outside the greater Dublin area. In the Dublin area, however, it was perceived as a major issue which needed attention. Results from a 1999 study conducted by the Women's Health Project indicated that 84% of women attending the project reported injecting heroin in the month prior to the study and 83% of the women indicated that the main reason they were working in prostitution was, in most cases, to make money for drugs.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, special drug treatment and support services are also provided through the Merchants Quay Women's Project, which is financially supported by the South-Western Area Health Board. These services include one to one support and advice on harm reduction. A health board mobile clinic also provides methadone services for this group.</P>
    <P>The national drugs strategy team and local drugs task forces have identified women working in prostitution as a special risk group needing particular focus on a cross task force basis. Specific actions will be developed accordingly in the task force areas where the need for such action has been identified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is the Minister aware that the Ruhama project, to which he referred, is finding it difficult to get funding? Is he aware that people involved in that project estimate there may be as many as 500 female prostitutes in the Dublin area alone? Is he aware that male prostitution is also on the increase? I welcome the Minister's reference to a task force because the health boards should have a greater role in providing women with assistance and we need an integrated task force on prostitution in Dublin with agencies such as the Garda Síochána, health boards, drug rehabilitation service, Probation and Welfare Service, Dublin Corporation's housing section and relevant bodies like Ruhama.</P>

      <P>Booster immunisations are provided in the school setting by health board teams in relation to a number of vaccines. These boosters are required for certain vaccines already given by GPs under the primary childhood immunisation programme in order to further boost immunity. The administration of the school booster programme is the responsibility of individual health boards in the first instance and vaccinations are provided in the school setting by health board teams. Schools are considered the most practical location for the administration of these vaccines as they provide access to a large proportion of the target group.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries of the health boards in relation to the procedures used in their areas. The boards have advised me that consent forms are sent to parents of children due for vaccination prior to the vaccination date. Relevant questions relating to the medical history of the child, including whether the child has suffered any serious illness and whether the child in question has had a reaction to a previous vaccine, are asked. An information sheet providing detailed information in relation to the vaccination in question is also circulated at the same time to parents. In addition, parents are invited to attend the vaccination session with their child.</P>
      <P>Health board medical personnel are aware of the contra-indications to the recommended childhood immunisations and review these in respect of each child prior to the administration of any vaccine. I am advised by the health boards that the personal medical history of the child is the relevant issue. The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland provides expert advice in relation to the contra-indications to various vaccines and the medical practitioner concerned is aware of this advice.</P>

      <Quest>the rate of uptake of the MMR vaccine among children in each health board area to the end of March 2001 as compared to March 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The MMR uptake rate for the first quarter of 2001 was 79.4% compared to 76.1% in the same period in 2000. I am circulating the information broken down by health board area as requested by the Deputy with this reply. The information circulated shows the MMR uptake rate for children aged 24 months in the first quarter of 2000 and 2001 by health board area.</P>
      <P>With the exception of one region, MMR uptake rates have improved in all health board areas. The National Disease Surveillance Centre has advised me that the overall improvement in MMR uptake rates seen in the first quarter of 2001 may in part be attributed to a greater number of parents having their children vaccinated in response to concerns about the measles outbreak which occurred in 2000.</P>
      <P>Although MMR uptake rates have improved in the first quarter of 2001, they still fall short of the national target rate of 95%. The national immunisation steering committee was established earlier this year to examine a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues which are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. I understand that work is at an advanced stage and the committee is expected to report later this year.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to urge parents to have their children immunised with the MMR vaccine in accordance with current recommendations. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contra-indications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their GP before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I am sure he would agree that, however welcome, the increase in only marginal. Does he not accept that when the desired level is 95%, a level of well under 80% represents a very serious shortfall? In 2000, there were almost 1,600 cases <Col N="118" /> of measles nationally. Will the Minister comment on this and would he agree that it amounts almost to a dangerous epidemic, especially when, in some cases, children's lives were lost? Would he respond to the concerns expressed by the National Disease Surveillance Centre? It has called for an initiative to encourage parents to have their children immunised and proposes a coalition for immunisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We will work with the National Disease Surveillance Centre in terms of progressing any of their ideas. Last year I established an immunisation steering committee to consider a number of issues, not only the up-take rates but out of date vaccines and so on, which arose as a result of the oral polio vaccination last year. A number of factors pertaining to MMR have resulted in decreases. There has been much debate in the press and the Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children conducted hearings on this issue in terms of alleged links between it and autism and so on. That has had an impact and we would bury our heads in the sands if we tried to pretend otherwise.</P>
      <P>Equally, there is room for improvement and for more focused and targeted programmes in areas where there are lower than average up-takes of MMR, especially in parts of Dublin. The National Disease Surveillance Centre takes the view that the outbreak of measles in 2000 in the Dublin area was perhaps primarily responsible for the increase in up-take in the Dublin area this year because of the attendant publicity it received. We will work with the centre to try to further improve the rates.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the health boards need to do more in terms of ensuring that immunisation levels are increased significantly? Does he consider that they should work more closely with general practitioners so that they will ensure children within their practices are given the option and encouraged to be immunised? It is dispiriting if it takes an epidemic of such large proportions to convince parents that their children need to be immunised. Will the Minister comment on the role of health boards and their apparent lack of a relationship with general practitioners in terms of dealing with this issue successfully?</P>

      <P>Health boards should have a very strong relationship with general practitioners. Some of the GP units within health boards were established in the first instance to try and develop a proper, structured relationship with general practitioners. I also agree that health boards need to be strategic in their approach to this issue. Last year and in 2000, I asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority to implement a specific programme of targeting in areas that are well below the average, as is the case in Dublin where imple<Col N="119" /> mentation is even well below the rate of 79% to which I referred.</P>

      <P>Very low. In such areas there should be a specific targeted programme, either through the schools or in tandem with the GPs, to increase the uptake. The health boards should move quickly in that direction in terms of a more targeted response. In terms of vaccination uptake, some areas are high but some are exceptionally low. As the statutory authorities, the health boards have a responsibility and obligation to take a more targeted approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Professor Hannah McGee and her colleagues at the Health Services Research Centre, Department of Psychology, Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin, for their in-depth evaluation of health and social services for older people from the perspective of older people themselves. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, spoke at the launch of this comprehensive report on 20 June and confirmed that my Department was happy to reaffirm that the policy is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent, to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to this philosophy of care is proven by the considerable injection of funding into the services which are at the heart of care in the community, for example, expansion of the home help service, specific assistance to carers, additional community support services, such as public health nurses, care assistants, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians together with the provision of new day care centres. While I acknowledge that the report highlights shortfalls in the provision of community-based services, a problem we have tackled by the injection of substantial additional <Col N="120" /> resources in recent years, I was encouraged by the many positive aspects in the report, including the following: some 75% of those surveyed are self-sufficient in the tasks of daily living; the majority had no functional disability; a very high percentage viewed their quality of life as being good or very good; a high percentage scored high on morale; the majority said that they were never, or not often, bothered by loneliness; and 85% said that they had a high level of emotional and social support. I assure the Deputy that the importance of care in the community will continue to be a major priority in the development of services for older people and will again receive special emphasis in the forthcoming health strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being a little disingenuous. Surely the point is that where older people are healthy and independent they are able to get on with life. We do not need a report to tell us that. Would he accept that this report confirms very serious problems and deficiencies in services for older people? One third of those with severe difficulties have no home services and a great number feel their views are not taken into account by health professionals.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is very little support when efforts are made to encourage elderly people to continue to live independently in their homes? Does he accept that the lack of assistance for carers is a problem? He has indicated he is looking at this need but he might like to comment on it. Does he agree that the lack of assessment of the needs of elderly people is also a problem? Is he aware of the lengthy delays elderly people can experience, for example, in waiting for an occupational therapist to assess their needs to provide them with the aids they desperately need when they are living at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties and delays occasioned by the shortage of occupational therapists and of their heavy workload in the regions in terms of progressing applications for aids and appliances. There has been a significant increase in the budget for these, especially last year. This is creating extra work for all concerned. We must look at streamlining the way things are done to get the aids and appliances quickly to older people in homes.</P>
      <P>From a philosophical and policy viewpoint we must move towards increased home supports and increased incentives to families to have older people kept at home. Over the last decade, since the introduction of the nursing home subvention scheme, the direction has been towards the institutionalisation of the elderly. In the early 1990s, when we were strapped for resources, that was the way forward and in many ways it filled the gap left by the failure of the public sector to provide community care beds or facilities under the aegis of health boards and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> However, there is a grave danger that if we do not shift policy away from an almost total dependence on the institutional model, that is, nursing home subventions, our basic philosophy of retaining and supporting people in the home will be undermined. That has always been the policy but it has not been acted on since the late 1980s. Extra investment has been made since 1997 but because of decisions made in the 1980s and 1990s it has not been acted on and the nursing home subvention was the result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme for the elderly operated through the health boards, which also comes under the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and which provides for the upgrading of facilities for elderly people, including improving the standard of their housing, is very slow to deliver. Will the Minister take account of this and will he ensure that health boards are providing for some elderly people who, even today, do not have full sanitary facilities? That basic need must be met in this day and age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

      <P>In the past year the Minister and his Department announced grant aid for elderly people to provide heating in their homes. Does the Minister accept that the scheme has not taken off because the health boards have not had sufficient manpower? Thousands of people are awaiting assessment.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus was right about a matter which concerns me in my County Mayo constituency where 1,300 people do not have basic sanitation. I have been waiting six months for the Western Health Board to apply for planning permission for a septic tank for a woman who has to go out to the fields to go to the toilet in the year 2001.

      <Quest>the reason waiting lists for orthodontic treatment can range from two years to six years in the Western Health Board area; his views on the role of specialist orthodontists as distinct from consultant orthodontists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25381/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is, in the first instance, the statutory responsibility of the health boards. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that at the end of the September 2001 quarter there were 1,479 patients on the category B treatment waiting list with an average waiting time of 42 to 48 months. There are no patients on the board's category A treatment waiting lists and as of the end of August 2001 there were 1,604 patients in orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>Patients are referred for secondary care orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department that prioritise the need for treatment based on the degree of handicap and the severity of malocclusion. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems those in category A but have a definite need of treatment and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. Additional funding of £495,000 has been allocated to the Western Health Board this year for orthodontic services of which £420,000 was for an orthodontic initiative.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that a specialist in orthodontics was recently recruited. The board envisages that he will start work in November this year. In addition, the board currently has two dentists in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. I am confident that these developments, on aggregate, will increase the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>The roles of consultant orthodontists and specialist in orthodontics differ in a number of respects. Consultant orthodontists lead hospital based orthodontic departments in the health boards. In their managerial roles, they provide leadership for a team that includes specialist orthodontists, general dental surgeons, dental auxiliaries and other support staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Consultant orthodontists take full responsibility for the planning, delivery and quality of orthodontic services in the boards, including organising the assessment of patients for ortho<Col N="123" /> dontic treatment and implementing my Department's guidelines for orthodontic treatment uniformly. The clinical role of consultant orthodontists comprises organising and undertaking the highest priority and complex treatments requiring multi-disciplinary intervention and ensuring the overall quality of care provided by both health board staff and private specialist orthodontic practitioners contracted to the health boards. They also take a leadership role in the academic training of consultants, specialists, general dental surgeons and dental auxiliaries in liaison with the universities and other statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>The duty of specialists in orthodontics is to participate in the organisation and delivery of orthodontic services under the overall direction of the consultants and to provide complex orthodontic treatment to patients attending the regional orthodontic units and community dental service clinics. They co-ordinate and assist with primary orthodontic treatment carried out by general dental surgeons in the community services, participate in clinical audits, assist in the assessment of the need for treatment in accordance with the orthodontic guidelines and participate in the training of staff in courses approved by the appropriate regulatory authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prompted to ask five questions arising from the Minister's reply. Is he happy with the level of public orthodontic services when waiting times are now over four years? Which guidelines are being followed? Are they the 1985 guidelines or some modified version of them adopted in 2000 and, if so, did the Minister authorise those modifications? Am I to understand that the consultant group recently recommended and approved a motion that there be no aesthetic component involved in the assessment for orthodontic treatment? Does the Minister agree that the modified guidelines now being operated are much more stringent than those of 1985 leaving patients exposed to less than ideal treatment? Has the Minister carried out an assessment of, or monitored, the assessments and recommendations made specifically regarding the extraction of impacted canine teeth which will leave the Department open to medical and legal challenges in the years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are modified guidelines. The health boards came forward with some modified approaches to the 1985 guidelines while new guidelines were being prepared in consultation with all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The size of the waiting lists, to a certain extent, made the new guidelines academic. They were made so not just in terms of the history of investment in orthodontics over the <Col N="124" /> past ten years, or the lack of it, but to a greater extent because of the failure of all concerned to develop constructive relationships with each other in the field collegially. I have been in the Department for a year and a half and as far as I can see the whole area is bedevilled by quarrels, old rows and conflicts that militate against providing a proper service.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's concern about this. Even if he does nothing else in the time left to him in office, he should sort this out. I again ask him to look at the monitoring of assessments where recommendations are made for extraction of impacted canine teeth. I have been shown disturbing evidence that would lead one to the conclusion that this amounts to mutilation and will leave the Department open to legal and medical charges. He must get a hold on this issue.</P>

      <P>I will have that checked immediately. I am committed to resolving this issue for <Col N="125" /> once and for all and determined to put in place structures to sort it out.</P>
      <P>Investment last year was geared towards the public infrastructure of health boards. Some are on board and some are not. Regarding what Deputy McCormack said, the problem there was that the health board in Dublin came forward with the idea of tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was a great idea and that I would support it all the way. I said that I would provide funding. The health board took legal advice and found that a difficulty lies with the Health Act, 1970. The Act confers full eligibility on patients for orthodontic treatment. The legal advice in respect of the initiative suggests we would dilute that eligibility by placing an obligation on people to bear a portion of the cost. Therein lies the crux.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>To address the question asked by Deputy Durkan, patients of some health boards are treated outside and that is allowed. We have also authorised, particularly within the Western Health Board, the provision of private treatment while the public infrastructure is being built up. Health boards can spend the money the Department made available to refer patients to private orthodontists. As of August 2001, 187 patients had been referred for private treatment in the Western Health Board area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards are in a position to offer appropriate counselling and support services to persons who are paedophiles and those with paedophile tendencies who are referred to them for treatment and who are identified as being in need of such services. The provision of these services is a matter in the first instance for each health board, having regard to the needs in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The successful completion of any treatment course depends critically on the full and willing participation of self-motivated individuals. Otherwise, the key elements of the programme concerned with challenging the individuals to take responsibility for their behaviour will not suc<Col N="126" /> ceed. The establishment of specialist treatment centres for paedophiles is not favoured at present as it could result in their being stigmatised and thus less likely to come forward for, or complete, a course of treatment.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. There are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their personal tendencies towards offending behaviour. While it is not possible to accurately quantify participation in all forms of rehabilitation, many of those in custody have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing my point. In fairness to him, he is adopting the customary approach which examines the criminal aspect of the matter. Acting out an urge is a criminal act whereas I am concerned with people who have identified tendencies within themselves but have not committed any crime or abuse and who want to have a facility dedicated to their needs.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is no dedicated facility for people who have such tendencies? The Minister is probably aware that people can obtain treatment privately at about £50 a consultation. Does he agree that those who cannot afford it &ndash; those on medical cards &ndash; should also have the right to a facility? Those with paedophile tendencies need specialised treatment which is not generally available in the psychiatric field. Psychiatrists have told me that it is a very specialised form of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question related to both paedophiles and those with paedophile tendencies. I am advised that the health boards are in a position to offer appropriate counselling and support services to such people. All those referred to services receive a full evaluation and services are provided according to individual needs. Some health boards are in a position to meet these service requests from within their own counselling complement. In other health board areas, persons are referred to private or voluntary agencies. I have been advised that it is not appropriate to identify the organisations or the personnel involved in the delivery of those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his Department should be more proactive in informing people of the availability of paedophile treatment services? It seems to be the domain of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in that it relates to crime. However, the condition itself is visited upon people against their wishes. Many want to control the tendencies and want advice and counselling.</P>

      <P>I have articulated in the reply that the idea of setting up a specially designated service is not one that has found favour so far with those in the health boards or the relevant professions on the grounds that it could lead to stigmatisation and, perhaps, a reluctance to participate as a result. Obviously there is a difference of opinion in that regard.</P>

The school has been in operation for the past six years. It began with six student and now has 138. Already 27 applications have been submitted for September 2002.</P>
      <P>At the start of the school year in September, sufficient students were attending to fulfil the teacher quota. Unfortunately, two families have now left the area which has reduced the numbers and means that a teacher will have to be let go.</P>

The children of this class, aged eight and nine, are at a vulnerable age and have established a rapport with the teacher and each other. They will now have to be mixed with another set of children and another teacher. This has greatly upset the parents who have threatened to withdraw the children from the school unless the problem is solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> The parents cannot understand how this could happen while the country enjoys the Celtic tiger economy. At the commencement of the next school year, the numbers will be sufficient to have the teacher quota. The teacher in question is newly qualified and wants to complete a first year diploma, which will now have to be suspended.</P>
    <P>The school has grown by leaps and bounds and has made a tremendous contribution to the community of Westport. To take away the teacher at this crucial stage would be morally wrong. I call on the Minister to intervene personally to retain the teacher and not to allow this happen to the children.</P>
    <P>The Gaelscoil, by its nature, is a specialised school and the children deserve to be given every chance, especially as a teacher will be required again in September 2002. I hope the Minister will deliver positive news on this matter. The teachers and parents of the excellent school are all very committed and have an excellent principal. They have already had to move on three occasions in relation to pre-fabricated buildings. If the job could only be made temporary until next September, it would resolve the problem as the school will have sufficient numbers next year. It would be very wrong to have little children moved from one class and divided among other classes. We talk a lot about children's constitutional rights, etc. and it would not cost a fortune to retain the teacher in the school until next year.</P>
    <P>I know there are departmental rules and regulations, but it was not the school's fault or the fault of the parents who left the area because they had to go elsewhere. As I said, it is a good school which makes a vital contribution to the educational needs of the Westport area. I ask the Minister to ensure the teacher in question will not have to look for another job next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's position in regard to the staffing of Gaelscoil na Cruaiche, Westport, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 was 118 pupils, which warrants a staffing for the 2001-02 school year of a principal and four mainstream class teachers. In addition, the school has a resource teacher and the services of a learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The only criteria by which a school may possibly gain an additional teaching post, apart from numbers as determined by reference to the enrolment on 30 September for the previous year, is by way of &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> The &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria for the 2001-02 school year are outlined in circular letter 12/2001, a copy of which the board of management of the school received earlier this year. To satisfy the criteria as outlined in the circular letter, the enrolment of Gaelscoil na Cruaiche on 30 September 2001 would have to have increased by at least 25 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September 2000.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the school would require an enrolment of at least 143 pupils on 30 September 2001. The school in question appointed an additional teacher under developing school grounds without achieving the enrolment of 143 pupils and without making an application to the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>As the enrolment on the 30 September 2001 according to data received from the board was only 138 pupils, an additional mainstream class teacher was not sanctioned for the 2001-02 school year. If the enrolment of 138 pupils on 30 September 2001 is valid, the board of management, on the basis of the existing staffing schedule, would be entitled to appoint an additional mainstream class teacher from 1 September 2002.</P>
    <P>Since this issue has also been drawn to the Minister's attention by other public representatives, he will arrange for a Department inspector to visit the school to report to him directly on its staffing needs and organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is on the late shift tonight. I do not see the Minister with responsibility for this area in the House. He must be fast-tracking his way back to Limerick.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to bring this matter to the attention of the House. The Minister of State will be aware from correspondence with me on this issue that there is an urgent need for the Department of Education and Science to commit additional resources to the Tallaght Travellers' Youth Service so that it can radically extend its literacy programme for Travellers in the Tallaght area.</P>
      <P>For the past five years the service has asked the Department to extend the number of teaching hours available to local Travellers. It provides 1,050 teaching hours in the Tallaght area for local Travellers. The service believes it is essential the number of teaching hours for its literacy programme be extended to 1,900 hours. The growing demand for literacy classes reflects the widespread need within the Traveller community for this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 250 Traveller families in the Tallaght area and this number has almost doubled in the past ten years. While the demand for Traveller education and, specifically, literacy programmes such as I have described has <Col N="130" /> increased dramatically in this time, we have not seen an increase in the number of educational services available to the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposal from the Tallaght Travellers' Youth Service would be to provide two additional teaching posts devoted solely to the enhancement of literacy skills for local Travellers. It should not be forgotten that, under the national development plan, a huge sum of money has been set aside for improving literacy standards throughout the country. It has been highlighted repeatedly that Travellers are a key group in terms of poverty and improving literacy and educational skills.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght Travellers' Youth Service does not understand why its proposal to extend the literacy service to Travellers has fallen on deaf ears within the Department of Education and Science for the past five years. This is not good enough and I challenge the Minister of State to explain how a group like this, which provides an essential service, should have to wait for funding when the Government has recognised the crucial work taking place within the community.</P>
    <P>I understand that funding for a special project such as this falls within the remit of the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science. In the course of his reply, I would like the Minister present to state how much additional money exists within the special projects for youth scheme, which is a specific subhead within the Department. The Minister of State has made much of his commitment to providing funds for literacy programmes. Why has this project has not received a favourable response from the Department to date?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science is responsible for the provision of youth work services. These services are in the sphere of non-formal education, and the Minister is continuing to make these services available to young people. This is done principally through the provision of financial assistance for national voluntary youth organisations, local youth work groups, youth information centres and special projects for youth throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Youth projects and organisations provide valuable opportunities for the social and personal development of young people. Through participation in such organisations, qualities and skills such as leadership, decision-making and taking responsibility for oneself are acquired and young people are encouraged to become active participants in a democratic society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The youth affairs section operates the special projects for youth scheme referred to by the Deputy and under which grants are allocated to organisations and groups for specific projects to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a combination of factors, including youth unemployment, substance abuse, social isolation and an inadequate take-up of ordinary educational opportunities. Approximately 180 <Col N="131" /> projects are in receipt of funding under this scheme and the allocation for 2001 is £8,714,193.</P>
    <P>The youth affairs section also operates the youth service grant scheme and the local youth club grant scheme. Under the former, funding is made available on an annual basis to national and major regional voluntary youth organisations for the support of voluntary youth work. Funding in 2001 amounts to £6,862,977. The local youth club grant scheme provides for the support of youth work activities at a local level. Grants are made available to youth clubs and groups through the local vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>While the scheme is open to all those involved in the provision of youth work, disadvantaged and marginal groups are the priority target. A total of £1 million has been allocated this year for the scheme. The Minister recognises the concern felt by youth organisations regarding the availability of increased resources for youth work and he will continue to be unstinting in his efforts to secure increases in youth work funding.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Youth Work Bill, 2000, is awaiting Report Stage. This Bill, when enacted, will provide a statutory framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services by the Minister and vocational education committees. This will be a landmark in the development of youth work services in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes to receive next month the national youth work development plan which he asked the national youth work advisory committee to prepare for him. This will serve as a vision or blueprint for the development of youth work services over the next five years or so.</P>
    <P>With reference to the application for funding under the special projects for youth scheme submitted by Catholic Youth Care and County Dublin Vocational Education Committee on behalf of the Tallaght Travellers' Youth Service, it was not possible to fund the project this year because of the large number of new applications received, 37 in total. It was only possible to fund three new projects due to the high level of existing commitments in the youth sector and to the limited funding available this year. It should be noted, however, that in 1999 and 2000 the Minister secured additional funding for 19 new projects under this scheme. It should also be noted that the Tallaght Youth Service is in receipt of funding under the special projects for youth scheme. A grant of approximately £480,000 has been made available for the provision of youth services in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to assure the Deputy that, in the context of funds available to him in 2002, he will be happy to re-examine a further application from the Tallaght Travellers' Youth Service. Application forms for the 2002 round of grants will issue shortly to all administering agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter which is an important one for the people of Lisnamrock near Ballingarry, County Tipperary. I also thank the Minister for coming to the House to answer this matter.</P>
      <P>Lisnamrock national school is a two teacher school with 46 pupils. It has disadvantaged status and benefits from the Breaking the Cycle programme. In September 2001, 11 junior infants enrolled in the school resulting in 31 pupils in the junior cycle spread over four classes. It is the belief of parents and teachers that the children are being deprived of a proper education because of the unacceptable pupil-teacher ratio of 31:1 in the multi-class junior cycle.</P>
      <P>As a participant in the Breaking the Cycle programme, they believe they are discriminated against when compared to their urban counterparts who have a pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1. Parents say they are also discriminated against under the school's disadvantaged status because urban disadvantaged schools have a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior cycle.</P>
      <P>The parents are very concerned about this. It is a long way to next year and, while they understand the Department has examined the situation, they are still concerned. I hope the Minister has some good news for me.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Tom Hayes for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science on the staffing in Lisnamrock national school.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a specific year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 was 43 pupils which warrants a staffing for the 2001-02 school year of a principal and one mainstream class teacher. In addition, the school has the services of a learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>Lisnamrock national school has disadvantaged status and was also included in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle programme. Schools with disadvantaged status qualify for supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil and also receive a refund of their television licence fee and a 95% grant for building projects. Inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle programme means Lisnamrock NS also receives annual grants of £1,000 for materials and equipment and £1,000 for out-of-school projects. The school was also included in one of 25 clusters of selected schools each served by a teacher/co-ordinator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lisnamrock National School is included in the rural dimension of the new programme launched <Col N="133" /> by the Minister on 4 January. Schools such as this one which benefited under the rural dimension of Breaking the Cycle will continue to receive the levels of additional support that were provided under that scheme. Lisnamrock National School has received supplementary grant aid of £750 for the 2000-2001 school year, which, in common with other schools being included in the new programme, is based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the extensive survey conducted last year by the Educational Research Centre. This funding has been allocated in addition to the Breaking the Cycle grants that are issued to Lisnamrock National School.</P>
    <P>Schools identified by the Educational Research Centre as having the highest concentration of disadvantaged pupils will be allocated the services of a teacher/co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. Lisnamrock National School already qualifies for inclusion in a cluster in County Tipperary because of its participation in Breaking the Cycle. Its cluster will continue to have the services of a local teacher/co-ordinator who will work with pupils, parents and teachers.</P>
    <P>Lisnamrock National School required an enrolment of at least 59 pupils on 30 September 2001 to gain an additional assistant under the scheme for schools designated as disadvantaged. As the enrolment on 30 September 2001, according to data received from the board of management, was only 46 pupils, I regret that there is no basis for the appointment of an additional mainstream class teacher for the 2001-2002 school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House on this matter. I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána for its excellent work on our behalf, which it performs in difficult times and in circumstances where it is understaffed and lacks resources. I support the call by the Garda Representative Association for additional gardaí. There is a widespread public belief that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has little or no appreciation of the level of vandalism and anti-social behaviour in our towns and housing estates. The Minister is aware of the serious difficulties on our streets at night, and particularly at weekends, after discos and at fast food outlets in almost all our towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing estates have additional difficulties caused, fortunately, by a small number of individuals, which impinge greatly on the local community. There is verbal abuse, stone and egg throwing, graffiti and breaking of windows and abuse of substances. Recently, I saw cases where every window in a house was broken. There was retaliation recently when men wearing balaclavas broke into a house with sledge hammers and caused damage. Garda cars are stoned. I dealt with 12 cases of families driven from housing estates in my constituency. Such families are traumatised and then discriminated against because <Col N="134" /> they are not allowed to apply for local authority housing for another 12 months. We do not need vigilantism and people taking the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>Additional gardaí, especially on the beat, and designated under community Garda schemes, are needed to deal with the problems that occur in housing estates. In Clonmel Corporation, we established a committee to liaise with local gardaí and members of the health board to deal with this. Unfortunately, we have been unable to meet local Garda representatives. Specially dedicated community gardaí should be based in local areas to liaise with communities, parents and youngsters. They should build up co-operation with and respect for the Garda among local communities. The Minister should urgently look at such schemes for south Tipperary, particularly in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary, Cashel and Fethard. I hope that the Minister will confirm that further Garda stations will not close.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to deal with the points raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Garda overall strength, as the Deputy will appreciate, as Minister, I am responsible for the overall provision of resources to the Garda Síochána while its authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas. When this Government took office it gave a simple commitment with regard to Garda strength. We said that we would increase the strength to 12,000 and delivered on that commitment. By the end of next year, the strength of the Garda Síochána will stand at 12,000, the highest ever in the history of the State. That will be an increase of 1,200 over the number of gardaí when I took up office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am proud that we have fulfilled this commitment and kept our promise to the people. I announced last week that 496 posts in the Garda Síochána are to be civilianised and this will free up an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties. The overall effect is that not only do we now have more gardaí but a higher proportion of them will be assigned to operational duties.</P>
      <P>As regards the deployment of those gardaí, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the level of Garda manpower assigned to various areas, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. As well as increasing the strength of the force, I also provided additional financial resources. The provision in the Garda Vote when I took office was £457 million while this year it is over £690 million, a significant increase by any standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the re-opening of small town, village and rural Garda stations. I question this implication most strongly because I have not closed stations and have no intention of doing so. <Col N="135" /> Indeed, £15 million is being spent this year on upgrading Garda accommodation at various locations around the country. I repeat that there is no policy of closing stations nor do I have any intention of introducing such a policy. It can be safely stated that never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and ensuring that the number of Garda personnel is increased. Furthermore, never have we had such a major prison building programme to ensure that those convicted of crime serve their sentences.</P>
    <P>Returning to the issue of Garda strength, the House will be aware that one of the Garda staff associations recently spoke about an optimum numbers survey. The possibility of such a survey was considered by the Garda SMI steering group in 1998 and was deferred due to reservations <Col N="136" /> about its value. I understand the Garda SMI steering group will revert to the issue at a later date. The Garda establishment redistribution model has since been introduced to ensure the optimum match between available Garda resources and demands for Garda services.</P>
    <P>We are increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000. I stress that this is the highest number in the history of the State. We are spending more money than ever on resources for the gardaí, ensuring that all of the other necessary components in the criminal justice system &ndash; such as a modern and effective prisons system &ndash; are in place to complement the work of the gardaí and continuing to put in place the necessary legislative framework to support them in their day-to-day job of fighting crime and enforcing the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>In response to a request from the Irish Nurses Organisation, I have established a special forum to examine the current difficulties being experienced by the three Dublin maternity hospitals in recruiting and retaining midwives.</P>
      <P>The forum includes representatives of the three maternity hospitals, my Department, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the nursing unions. It held its first meeting on 19 October, and has been asked to report back to me as a matter of urgency with recommendations to address the current difficulties.</P>
      <P>There are parallel discussions taking place between the three maternity hospitals and the Eastern Regional Health Authority regarding service issues.</P>
      <P>I want to set the record straight in relation to the extent of the midwifery shortages in the Dublin area. Media reports of 110 midwifery posts vacant in the three Dublin maternity hospitals are incorrect. Information received by my Department recently indicates that while the three hospitals are short 84 midwives, the net vacancy situation is actually 54 posts, when account is taken of the number of registered general nurses that have been employed by the hospitals.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the present staffing difficulties have been identified by the steering group overseeing the study of the nursing and midwifery resource. In its interim report, the steering group indicated that the shortage of nurses is most acute in the Dublin area where the cost of housing and traffic problems are making it increasingly difficult not only to recruit but also to retain nurses and midwives. The ongoing development of specialist health services throughout the country has also swelled the traditional movement of nurses from the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor contributing to the pressure on the obstetric services in Dublin, as identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, is the increased number of births in the Eastern region <Col N="138" /> in recent years from 20,646 births in 1996 to 22,813 in 2000, with a further increase expected in 2001. There has been direct negotiations between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the three Dublin maternity hospitals to specifically discuss service issues that are affecting work load.</P>
    <P>A significant contributory factor to the current pressures is the level of referrals from outside the Eastern region. Approximately 10% of activity in the Dublin maternity hospitals relates to persons resident outside of the Eastern region. The ERHA has recommended to the Dublin maternity hospitals that referrals from outside the region should be based on an assessment by a consultant in the women's own region that such a referral is warranted on clinical grounds.</P>
    <P>The provision of a comprehensive, safe and high quality obstetric service for the Eastern Region will continue to be of the utmost priority. In this context, I want to assure the House that I will act on the recommendations of the special forum, whose report I expect within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is well aware of the public's desire for increased health spending on the reduction of waiting lists and the improvement of health services. I might remind the Deputy that the overall budget for health services for 2001 is over £5 billion or 6.35 billion. This represents a doubling by this Government of Exchequer input since 1997. The national development plan represents the greatest level of investment in health capital infrastructure &ndash; £2 billion, 2.54 billion at 1999 prices &ndash; and is designed to bring benefits to all areas of the health services.</P>
      <P>It is worth listing some of the benefits of this increased funding across the whole health system.</P>
      <P>Acute Hospitals</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some £1 billion or 1.27 billion has been provided under the national development plan for the development of hospital infrastructure. This will allow for the provision of major developments in the acute hospital sector in every region of the country. This Government has overseen significant increases in hospital activity levels. In particular there has been a 29% increase in day care activity in hospitals since this Government came into office. The hospital system has continued its high productivity performance in January to June 2001 by recording an overall rise <Col N="139" /> of 5.1% activity increase, including almost 11% growth in day cases. This translates into an extra 22,000 cases treated over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of about 25% in the numbers employed in the health service since this Government came into office. We now have about 83,000 wholetime equivalent staff working in the health service. This includes an additional 250 consultants in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>Cancer Strategy</P>
    <P>Over £60 million or 76.184 million has been allocated under the national cancer strategy since 1997 and an additional 57 consultants together with support staff have been approved.</P>
    <P>Cardiovascular Strategy</P>
    <P>We are now spending an additional £38 million or 48.250 million on cardiovascular and cardiac surgery services.</P>
    <P>Intellectual Disability and Physical Disability</P>
    <P>Additional investment of £205 million or 260.35 million has been made for the period mid-1997 to 2001 on services, both capital and non-capital, for the intellectually disabled and a further £107 million or 135.89 million for the physically disabled.</P>
    <P>Services for Older People</P>
    <P>Additional development funding has increased from £3 million or 3.81 million in 1997 to £33 million or 41.91 million this year, excluding funding for nursing home subvention.</P>
    <P>Childcare</P>
    <P>Since the end of 1997 additional revenue of the order of £92.5 million or 117.475 million has been allocated for the further strengthening and development of child welfare and protection services.</P>
    <P>Waiting Lists </P>
    <P>Dedicated funding of £74.57 million or 94.68 million was allocated from 1997 to 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and £34.5 million or 43.805 million has been allocated under the waiting list initiative for 2001 to provide additional procedures to those on waiting lists. Significant decreases have taken place in the number of patients waiting in the target specialties since June 2000; the number awaiting cardiac surgery is down by 52%, gynaecology is down by 35%, ophthalmology is down by 23% orthopaedics is down by 14% and ENT is down by 30%.</P>
    <P>Review of Bed Capacity </P>
    <P>It is well recognised that the single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. A comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with <Col N="140" /> the social partners. The review has focused primarily on the emerging needs to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The review of bed capacity will inform the new health strategy.</P>
    <P>Health Strategy</P>
    <P>The health strategy will provide a framework for growth and development of our health services over the coming years. In addition to issues of capacity of services, the strategy will address issues relating to reform and modernisation of the health system. The strategy will outline the direction and scale of development planned in a number of service and professional areas for example acute hospital bed capacity, primary health care, medical manpower, nursing etc. In addition, the strategy will include a plan covering the actions required for its implementation in the short, medium and long-term.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to the strategic planning and development of the health service. The increased level of capital and non-capital investment which I have outlined is strong evidence of the priority this Government attaches to improving the health services in this country.</P>

      <P>Over £60 million or 76.184 million in total has been allocated to date under the national cancer strategy since 1997. All of the commitments in the action plan of March 1997 have either been implemented or are in the course of implementation. The following is an outline of the main developments:&ndash;</P>
      <P>Establishment of a national cancer forum to advise on the implementation of the national cancer strategy. The first forum met from March 1997 to April 2000. The second forum has been established and has held four meetings, with a fifth scheduled for 12 December 2001.</P>
      <P>The appointment was made of regional directors of cancer services &ndash; one in each health board area, three in the ERHA &ndash; to oversee the development of cancer services in their areas and to prepare a regional cancer plan.</P>
      <P>Approval was given for 58 additional consultant posts in key areas, such as medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care, together with support staff. A number of these have already taken up post, while others are at various stages of recruitment.</P>
      <P>Phase one of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme was launched in October 2000 covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and the North Eastern and Midland Health Boards. This programme is currently available to all women living in the phase one areas aged between 50 and 64 years. Up to 30 June 2001 BreastCheck had invited 43,283 women to attend for screening. BreastCheck is currently in consultation with the health boards regarding the roll out of the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>The report entitled Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease was published in March 2000. It contains recommendations for the establishment of a network of specialist breast units throughout the country. Funding totalling £4.35 million or 5.52 million has been provided in the current year to enable a number of health agencies to commence the development of centres of excellence for the care and treatment of symptomatic breast disease.</P>
      <P>The national cervical screening programme was launched in October 2000 covering the Mid-</P>
      <P>Western Health Board area. As with Breastcheck, the experience gained from phase one will facilitate the planning and organising of the roll out of this programme. Currently, the chief executive officers of the health boards are involved in an examination of the feasibility of extending the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>The report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care was published on 4 October 2001. This report will form the foundation stone in the further development of palliative care services in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Research Board was allocated a grant of £80,000 or 101,579 per annum for each of the years 1997 to 2000 for the co-ordination of <Col N="142" /> multi-disciplinary multi-institutional research, as indicated in the national cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>Research projects are also being funded under a tripartite agreement between my Department, the Health Department in Northern Ireland and the National Cancer Institute in the USA. In addition, an All-Ireland Cancer Incidence and Mortality Report was launched on 1 May 2001.</P>
    <P>I will continue to be advised by the national cancer forum in relation to the planning, development and co-ordination of cancer services for the country.</P>

      <P>The Cardiovascular Health Strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts, published in 1999, recommended the development of a pilot study of a register of heart attack patients. It was envisaged that the lessons from this would be used to establish a national hospital based register of coronary care.</P>
      <P>Prior to the publication of Building Healthier Hearts the Irish Heart Foundation had already established a CHAIR &ndash; coronary heart attack Ireland register &ndash; steering group in conjunction with the Southern Health Board and my Department. However, because of operational and detailed issues emerging it was felt best to develop a pilot study on a regional basis before proceeding to national implementation.</P>
      <P>Given the broad mix of hospital sites and the population size, the Southern Health Board was invited by the Department of Health and Children to act as the formal pilot site for the CHAIR project in November 1998. The Southern Health Board accepted the invitation. The decision to establish such a pilot project in the Southern Health Board area was taken prior to my appointment as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Since then discussions with the Southern Health Board have been ongoing and a local steering committee has been established to oversee the pilot. The Southern Health Board has recently recruited a project manager for the CHAIR project in its region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced the establishment of the CHAIR national steering committee. Its terms of reference will include responsibility for the management of the CHAIR project at national level by: agreeing the scope of the data to be gathered; agreeing the mechanism for the collection of this data; agreeing the terms for monitoring outcomes and criteria for evaluating the pilot project; taking account of appropriate international data sets and developments relevant to the CHAIR project; and advising on the national roll-out of the CHAIR project to all health boards, assuming its successful implementation according to agreed <Col N="143" /> criteria in the Southern Health Board during the pilot phase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At my request a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, Director of the Virus Reference Laboratory, was recently established to prepare an operational plan which would be implemented in the event of a biological attack on this country. The committee agreed that in preparing a plan it will be necessary to identify the level of risk of such an attack and that the plan should reflect the risk identified. The committee considered that as the risk of a primary attack on this country was low a plan should therefore be prepared to cater for a secondary attack.</P>
      <P>While work on the detailed plan is progressing a specific protocol to deal with a suspected anthrax attack was prepared, at my request, in light of the recent anthrax attacks in the United States. I launched this protocol on Wednesday, 17 October. Prior to the launch of this protocol I met with members of the committee as well as the gardaí, fire services and Defence Forces. During this meeting the roles of the various bodies were clearly defined and agreed. In addition I spoke with my counterpart in the UK in order to ensure the absolute safety of our plan. He confirmed that the protocol was similar to that in place in the UK.</P>
      <P>The protocol was prepared by the expert committee and deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax attack including patient treatment and management, post exposure guidelines etc.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with a suspect package believed to contain anthrax are included in the protocol.</P>
      <P>The protocol is a work in progress and is being revised on an ongoing basis as a result of feedback to the committee. The protocol and guidelines are available on my Department's web site &ndash; www.doh.ie. A copy of the protocol has already been provided to each Member of the House. The protocol was also issued to key services, including the fire service, the Garda, the Defence Forces and the director of public health in each health board.</P>
      <P>In relation to treatment in the event of exposure to anthrax the Irish Medicines Board has confirmed that sufficient quantities of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin have been secured to treat patients in the event of exposure. The IMB have also confirmed that they have been able to source 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> I have arranged for the public health laboratory in Cherry Orchard Hospital to receive both the clinical and environmental samples. The clinical samples will be dealt with in Cherry Orchard while the environmental samples will be forwarded to the UK for analysis. To date, 52 suspect samples returned after analysis by the laboratory at Porton Down in the UK have proved negative. In addition, all individual nasal swabs tested have been confirmed negative.</P>
    <P>The committee has met five times to date and is currently drafting a protocol to deal with other category A biological agents.</P>
    <P>Lead responsibility for chemical emergency planning rests with my colleague, the Minister for Environment and Local Government. While there is no evidence of any immediate threat of attack from chemical agents, and the public have been reassured on this issue, the need to consider precautions in the event of such a threat has been addressed.</P>
    <P>An expert working group, chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, comprising of technical experts from the relevant Departments and agencies &ndash; the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Defence and their agencies &ndash; has prepared a draft protocol for frontline emergency services personnel response to incidents involving actual or suspected chemical agents or devices in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The protocol will issue in the coming days from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. While the protocol is primarily designed for frontline emergency services personnel, it will be appropriately published. The advice to the public on steps to be taken if a suspected chemical agent or device is discovered on a premises and on the characteristics of suspicious packages and letters will be widely published.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the public that these arrangements are being put in place as a precaution.</P>

      <P>I jointly commissioned a research study together with the North-Eastern Health Board to look at the extent of domestic violence perpetrated against men. The researchers remit was to identify in so far as it is possible the incidence of domestic violence against men and to identify the most appropriate responses to such incidents from the statutory service providers. Independent research consultants were engaged to carry out this work at a cost of £40,000 or 50,789.52 and the report was presented in late 2000. The methodology employed was to examine major studies on domestic violence which were carried out across English speaking developed countries, such as the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, and to apply the findings of these studies to the Irish situation. It should be pointed out that the study did not attempt to embark on study of the prevalence of domestic violence in Ireland due to resourcing and time considerations.</P>
      <P>The findings of the study are based on self-reports of victimisation. The authors hold that while there is under-reporting in the case of perpetration and over-reporting of victimisation, it is the only effective way of ascertaining the true prevalence of domestic violence. The researchers believe that Irish prevalence rates should not be any different to the countries researched.</P>
      <P>I have recently received the report of the research study and my Department is currently concluding consultations with relevant State agencies aimed at identifying the implications for service provision raised by the report's findings. I propose to publish the report shortly when these consultations are complete.</P>

      <P>The provision of hospital services to persons with tinnitus is a matter in the first instance for the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by representatives of the Irish Tinnitus Association regarding the level of services available in major hospitals to tinnitus sufferers. In this regard, I have had inquiries made of the health boards and the ERHA in order to assess the current position.</P>
      <P>Following clarification of the service position, officials from my Department met with representatives of the association on 20 September 2001. At this meeting, various issues were discussed, including the association's proposal for the establishment of a designated clinic specifically for tinnitus sufferers and the need for funding of a lo-call helpline for the association. These proposals are being assessed within my Department and will be the subject of further discussion with the association in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Information Commissioner published a report entitled Freedom of Information &ndash; Compliance by Public Bodies in July 2001, which made recommendations on a range of issues for consideration by public bodies. The commissioner also made a number of specific recommendations in relation to freedom of information &ndash; FOI &ndash; procedures within the Department of Health and Children. My Department is taking action to address these issues.</P>
      <P>The Information Commissioner's specific concerns as regards my Department were in relation to the failure to meet the deadlines as set down in the Act, the level of training provided for decision makers and internal review officers, and the independence of internal review procedures. He also recommended changes in the manner in which the Department advised people of their rights of appeal under the Act.</P>
      <P>The freedom of information unit in the Department has developed new procedures to address the issue of timeliness and to strengthen existing quality control measures. Requesters' rights of review under the Act are now set out within the decision letter and a standard notice of these is also enclosed with each acknowledgement.</P>
      <P>A phased programme of training is already under way and will address the concerns of decision-makers arising from their work on actual requests.</P>
      <P>The Information Commissioner advised Departments to concentrate its FOI expertise and to consider the use of a panel of senior staff to conduct internal reviews. My Department is setting up an internal review board &ndash; to be chaired by an assistant secretary. This will address the commissioner's concern about the independence of the internal review where that is carried out by the decision maker's supervisor. The Department is also considering concentrating decision making to a smaller number of staff in order to maintain the necessary expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional resources have been assigned to the freedom of information unit which will play an <Col N="148" /> active role in processing requests and in supporting the new review panel.</P>
    <P>The commissioner referred in his report to the need for each public body to have a records management policy. In this regard, records management consultants have completed a pilot study of two areas of the Department and their recommendations are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Department is also addressing the more general recommendations contained in the report and, specifically, the identification of material of general public interest which may be published routinely outside the Act.</P>
    <P>While the new procedures are already taking effect, there is a substantial backlog of overdue requests and in particular of internal reviews. It is my intention to have this backlog dealt with as quickly as possible. The measures which are being taken will bring about significant improvements in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government published the Report of the Forum on Medical Manpower earlier this year and approved the establishment of a national task force on medical manpower to, <i>inter alia</i>, prepare and oversee the implementation of a detailed programme based on the report's recommendations. The Government also decided that it would consider the proposed development of a consultant delivered public hospital service following quantification of the resource and cost implications involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department, in consultation with Mr. David Hanly, independent chairperson of the national task force on medical manpower, have been working on the draft terms of reference and working structures of the task force over the summer months, and it is envisaged that the task force will be established shortly. The task force will provide appropriate representation to all the relevant stakeholders and facilitate rapid progress through a structure of project groups which will work on a programme of priority issues in a parallel format. I am confident that this <Col N="149" /> approach is the most appropriate and will yield rapid results.</P>
    <P>I have recently received the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland's very useful response to the report of the medical manpower forum, which, I was pleased to note, welcomed the recommendations contained in the forum report.</P>
    <P>In its response, the association raised a number of important and challenging issues, including the implications for the anaesthesia specialty of the reduction of NCHD working hours and the possible reconfiguration of certain hospital services in the context of a consultant delivered service. All of the issues raised in the response will be considered by the task force.</P>
    <P>The Deputies may wish to note that a number of staffing difficulties were identified last year in hospitals in relation to the provision of anaesthetic cover. In response, a recruitment campaign was initiated in India and Pakistan which resulted in the employment of 50 NCHDs. This recruitment campaign filled all identified vacancies.</P>

      <P>I have recently appointed four new members to the board, including a new chairman, Mr. Michael McLoone, Donegal County Manager. I am fully satisfied that the competencies of the new appointees, allied with the skills and experience of existing members, will ensure that the service continues its programme of change and development. The major priority of the new chairman, the board together with the staff, is to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing environment in transfusion science in a positive and productive way that best meets the needs of our hospital services. For my part, I will ensure that necessary resources are available to the board so that its processes and procedures remain in line with the leading transfusion services internationally.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. In addition, persons aged 70 and over are automatically eligible for medical cards.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, the whole issue of eligibility is being examined in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my Department and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy entitled Waiting Lists: Analysis, Evaluation and Recommendations received wide media coverage at the end of August 2001. The analysis and description of the health service in the report is a useful addition to the current debate on hospital waiting lists. The report also identifies a number of shortcomings in the present system and makes recom<Col N="151" /> mendations on how to address them. It is worth noting, however, that the report recognises that hospital waiting lists cannot be dealt with in isolation from other issues in the hospital service. The report notes that the single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability.</P>
      <P>In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The review will inform the forthcoming health strategy.</P>
      <P>I will continue to focus on the problem of hospital waiting lists and waiting times to ensure that services are available to those who most need them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Irish Haemophilia Society wrote to me on 6 September seeking an extension to the Lindsay tribunal terms of reference to enable the tribunal to investigate the actions of certain multinational pharmaceutical companies. Section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1998, provides that terms of reference can only be amended where the tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment, following consultation with the Attorney General on behalf of the relevant Minister, or where the tribunal itself has requested the amendment. Accordingly, I wrote to the Attorney General on 10 October asking him to seek the consent of Judge Lindsay to an extension of her terms of reference to facilitate: (i) a request for voluntary discovery from the pharmaceutical companies; (ii) an order for discovery against the pharmaceutical companies; (iii) procurement of documentation under US Freedom of Information legislation; and (iv) an application for access to the document depository in Pensacola, Florida.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 October the chairperson furnished a detailed response to the Attorney General in which she stated that she did not believe that it would be correct for her to consent to the suggested amendment of the terms of reference of <Col N="152" /> the tribunal. A copy of the chairperson's response has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Originally it was believed that the possible closure of the document depository in Pensacola might affect the achievement of a full investigation of the pharmaceutical companies. I would like to bring the House up to date in relation to this matter. The depository was created to ensure that all American HIV-infected haemophiliac plaintiffs had access to similar quality and volume of discovered documentation in respect of their litigation against pharmaceutical companies. It had been suggested that the depository would close with effect from 1 January 2002, and that any further applications for access would have to be made by 1 November 2001. However, solicitors for the IHS have contacted the lead counsel for the depository, and have now informed me that an application would need to be made as soon as practicable, but that 1 November is not a strict deadline. Assurances have been furnished that, while the documents may be moved to a different site or sites, they will not be destroyed. This has been confirmed by a US firm retained by the Attorney General's office. Lead counsel has also given an assurance to the IHS solicitors that, should the pharmaceutical companies seek the return of their documents, this will be opposed.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the concerns of people with haemophilia in Ireland, as well as the wider public, in relation to this matter. Notwithstanding the complex legal difficulties associated with an Irish tribunal seeking to investigate entities in other jurisdictions, I am presently consulting with the Attorney General on the options available, and I will revert to the House again as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Although health or health targets were not included in the original national anti-poverty strategy &ndash; NAPS &ndash; published in 1997, my Department has been involved in setting and reviewing annual workplans for NAPS. More recently, as part of its commitment to tackling social exclusion, the Government gave a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to review the NAPS across all relevant Departments and to develop NAPS targets in the health area with an associated monitoring and implementation framework. The Department established a working group on NAPS and health which included the social partners and the Combat Poverty Agency and sought the assistance of the Institute of Public Health with research and consultation aspects of the exercise.</P>

      <P>Since the commencement of the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997, over £60 million or 76.184 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to the development of cancer services nationally. This investment has resulted in additional consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care.</P>
      <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service, requiring specialist personnel including for example, therapeutic radiographers, nurses with training in oncology, technical and engineering support staff. A minimum throughput of patients is required in order to maintain and develop the specialist skills required for the service.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Forum, after careful consideration of the complex issues involved, recommended a comprehensive needs assessment of the country's radiotherapy requirements be undertaken with the objective of ensuring that service availability matches evidence based need.</P>
      <P>In May 2000, I established the expert working group on radiotherapy services to examine appropriate radiotherapy service development requirements on a national level having regard to the developments in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment in recent years, the provisions of the national cancer strategy in relation to radiotherapy services and best practice in this area. The expert group has been asked: to undertake an assessment of need in relation to radiotherapy services, including recommended norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing for facilities; and on the basis of needs identified, to make recommendations on the future development of radiotherapy services, including links with radiotherapy services in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in this context that the assessment of need for radiotherapy services at Waterford Regional <Col N="154" /> Hospital will be carried out. Mr Gordon Watson, Regional Director for Cancer Services in the South-Eastern Health Board area, represents the regional directors on the expert working group on radiotherapy services. Because of the importance and complexity of the work of the expert group, it is not possible to give an exact date for their report but it is anticipated that their work will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 165 of 2000) gives effect to EU Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs. Regulation 4 of the Regulations puts an onus on proprietors of food businesses to develop a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points &ndash;  HACCP &ndash; system for their business. Under the regulations proprietors of food businesses must ensure that their businesses are operated in a hygienic way. Proprietors are also obliged to identify steps in the activities of their business which are critical to ensuring food safety and ensure that adequate safety procedures are identified, implemented and reviewed.</P>
      <P>Since July 1999, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland &ndash; FSAI &ndash; is responsible for the enforcement of all food safety legislation in Ireland, including those regulations dealing with food hygiene. The FSAI carries out its functions by means of &ldquo;service contracts&rdquo; with a range of official agencies, for example, health boards, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The FSAI meets with health boards on a regular basis to monitor the implementation of the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FSAI conducted a survey in 2000 on the implementation of HACCP and Food Safety Training. It was carried out in a number of health board areas and involved over 1,000 small to medium sized food businesses from the catering and retailing sectors. The survey was carried out by the FSAI primarily to determine the barriers to the introduction by food businesses of a food safety management system based on the prin<Col N="156" /> ciples of HACCP. The findings were reported at a HACCP workshop at the end of July 2001.</P>
    <P>I understand that the FSAI, via the health boards, were already aware that compliance with HACCP was low prior to conducting the survey, but the reasons for this were not clear. The survey has enabled the FSAI to identify some of the key issues that are preventing food businesses from meeting their legal obligation.</P>
    <P>The workshop that was used to publicise the findings of the survey was designed to enable the FSAI, the food industry and the Health Boards to develop a HACCP strategy to tackle the barriers that have been identified.</P>
    <P>The HACCP strategy outlines the actions that the FSAI and health boards will take over the next three years to facilitate and improve levels of compliance. The &ldquo;HACCP Strategy&rdquo; also establishes measures by which the effectiveness of the plan can be determined. The strategy builds on programmes that are currently under way in each of the health boards.</P>
    <P>To date four health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority have developed guides to HACCP that have been distributed to food businesses. Two more health boards have HACCP leaflets and the remaining health boards have utilised publicity campaigns, letters and other means as a way of ensuring food businesses are aware of their legal obligations.</P>
    <P>The FSAI plans to build upon these developments with national campaigns, technical guides and the development of targeted HACCP implementation plans with key industry representative organisations. The health boards and FSAI plan to co-ordinate their activities for maximum impact. The HACCP strategy will be overseen by a steering committee of the FSAI.</P>

      <P>Orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in operation. Their purpose is to allow prioritisation of children for orthodontic treatment based on the severity of need.</P>
      <P>It is important that health boards identify those patients in greatest need by the use of the orthodontic guidelines and commence timely treatment for them. Patients assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care; patients assessed as category B have less severe problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officers report on orthodontics, known as the Moran Report, recommended the use of an alternative index of need. <Col N="157" /> This is known as the index of orthodontic treatment need &ndash; IOTN. The chief dental officer has advised that this new index should not be implemented until its implications have been evaluated in a national survey of children's dental health. This survey is currently under way and is expected to be completed in April 2002. The purpose of the survey is to identify accurately the number of children that would benefit from orthodontic treatment and the resources needed to meet the corresponding level of care.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991 on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital.</P>
      <P>Currently, there is a statutory charge of £25 for attendance at accident and emergency departments where a person has not been referred by a medical practitioner. Medical card holders are exempt from this charge. On admission to hospital, following directly from attendance at an accident and emergency department, a patient must then decide whether he or she wishes to be treated as a public or private patient. In relation to each clinical consultation private patients, following admission to hospital, are liable for the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants fees in addition to the statutory charges once they explicitly exercise their option to be treated as a private patient.</P>

      <P>In 1999, the World Health Organisation produced a detailed blueprint for an influenza pandemic plan, setting out the issues which arise nationally and internationally in relation to a possible future influenza pandemic. A pandemic would have very serious effects in terms of mortality and morbidity and services such as acute hospitals and general practice would experience greatly increased workloads, well in excess of those seen during more regular outbreaks of influenza.</P>
      <P>Last year I established a committee, chaired by Professor William Hall, Director of the Virus Reference Laboratory, to draw up plans to address any future influenza pandemic. I also asked this committee to consider issues which arise in relation to the more regular outbreaks of influenza, and how our health services might best be prepared for these. These issues include; prevention strategies; surveillance and early warning systems; scientific and medical issues; vaccination policy; pharmaceutical supplies and logistical matters; hospital and community responses; economic, legal and political concerns; communications; and an effective management process.</P>
      <P>I understand that work in relation to the preparation of the plan is at an advanced stage and that the document is now available for wider consultation. It is expected that the plan will be presented to my Department later this year.</P>
      <P>When the plan is presented it is intended that it will be examined by the relevant experts in the fields concerned and appropriate legal advice will be sought in relation to the legislative and constitutional issues raised in the plan.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards have responsibility for the discharge planning function in their respective areas, in conjunction with individual hospitals. The decision to discharge a patient from hospital to home is a matter for the patient's consultant, based on clinical judgment and assessment of the patient's condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for ongoing invest<Col N="159" /> ment in the discharge planning function. As the Deputy is aware, funding of £32 million or 40.63 million was approved on foot of phase 1 of the national review of bed capacity in 2000-01 to help alleviate service pressures and to maintain services to patients. Funding to facilitate improved efficiency in the discharge planning and bed management function was included in this investment package. This was designed to eliminate any avoidable delays in the patient assessment process prior to discharge home or transfer to an alternative setting.</P>
    <P>For people with disabilities, funding is provided from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for a grant scheme to allow appropriate modifications to be made to meet the accessibility needs of people with disabilities in their homes. This grant is administered through the local authorities. The Deputy may wish to pursue this matter further with my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey.</P>
    <P>Older people can benefit from the special housing aid scheme for the elderly, which is operated by the health boards on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The scheme is designed to improve the housing conditions of older people, i.e., to make them habitable. The type of work carried out includes essential repairs, painting and decorating, the provision of heating, water, sanitation, door-locks and other security devices, etc.</P>

      <P>A request was made by the North-Eastern Health Board in June 2000 to commence the process of selecting design teams for a number of capital projects to develop the five acute hospital sites within its area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, approval was sought to publish a prior indicative notice &ndash; PIN &ndash; in the Official Journal of the EU, as required by Government rules on public procurement. This was agreed by officials of my Department on 19 July 2000 subject to the understanding that completing the pro<Col N="160" /> cess of design team selection and appointment would require prior agreement of the final design briefs for the various projects being considered by the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The board has not yet submitted final design briefs to my Department for approval. I understand that the board is currently reviewing its assessment of needs, and the proposed functional content of the five projects, with a view to revising the draft briefs for the consideration and agreement of the relevant project teams and the overall steering group. My Department will deal promptly with any request from the board for formal approval of considered and completed design briefs. It is a matter now for the North-Eastern Health Board to confirm its programme for completion of this stage of the project development, and to propose a timetable for further stages, including the appointment of design teams.</P>
    <P>I should point out that separate proposals for design team selection and appointment have been received from the North-Eastern Health Board since August of this year, in respect of priority projects of limited scope to deal with immediate problems in specific areas on each of the five hospital sites. Officials of my Department have agreed each of these proposals in principle, subject to detailed conditions, in order to expedite progress of necessary work in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that in fulfilling it's obligations in relation to the planning of these projects, my Department has assisted the board to progress these proposals as quickly as possible. I am confident that the work that has been undertaken to date will form the basis to make significant progress in the future.</P>

      <Quest>if he has plans to raise the level of subvention in nursing homes in line with costs.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22824/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from contracts entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90-114.28, £120-152.37, £150-190.46 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which <Col N="161" /> are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase, and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
    <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. As referred to above, Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million. An additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's Report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of <Col N="162" /> auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training this month for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way. Through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board, I have also funded the appointment of a Director of Specialist Training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry. The post-graduate director will assume his duties in January 2002. His role will be to promote and ensure that co-ordinated post-graduate training in dentistry of a high standard is provided.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million or 6.729 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million or 4.698 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following progress with their developments under the initiative. Two additional consultant orthodontists, five specialists in orthodontics, one dental team and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board &ndash; ECAHB &ndash; have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised; a competition to fill the post of dental hygienist in the ECAHB has been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidate is currently in train; a competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future; a six surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open &ndash; the treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; and three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> My Department has recently approved a proposal from the Mid-Western Health Board to engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a Professor in Orthodontics at Cork Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan, both of which are operational, and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were approximately 15,920 patients in orthodontic treatment.</P>

      <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening programme was launched in Limerick on 16 October 2000. Under phase one, cervical screening is being offered to approximately 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group, free of charge, at five-yearly intervals, in the Mid-Western Health Board area. An expert advisory group on cervical screening is currently overseeing the implementation of phase one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience gained from phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the introduction of the national programme. The chief executive officers of the health boards are currently involved in an examination of the feasibility and implications &ndash; resource requirements etc. &ndash; of extending the programme to the rest of the country. In light of the organisational and resource implications, there would appear to be merit in a phased introduction of the national <Col N="167" /> programme. The introduction of the remaining phases of the programme will require the development of population based registers and the availability of laboratory capacity, appropriate quality assurance and follow-up services where treatment is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At my request a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, director of the virus reference laboratory, was recently established to prepare an operational plan which would be implemented in the event of a biological attack on this country. While work on the detailed plan is progressing a specific protocol to deal with a suspected anthrax attack has been prepared, at my request, in light of the recent anthrax attacks in the United States. The committee agreed that in preparing a plan it will be necessary to identify the level of risk of such an attack and that the plan should reflect the risk identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee considered that as the risk of a primary attack on this country was low a plan should therefore be prepared to cater for a secondary attack. The committee is currently drafting a protocol to deal with other class A biological agents such as smallpox. The first draft of this <Col N="168" /> protocol was examined by the expert committee which met this morning.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has confirmed that sufficient quantities of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin have been secured to treat patients in the event of exposure to anthrax. The Irish Medicines Board has further confirmed that they have also secured 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccine which can be used in the event of a smallpox attack. In addition, other relevant antibiotics which may be necessary are available in adequate supply.</P>
    <P>The national nuclear emergency plan is co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise. Stocks of iodine tablets were distributed to, and held by, all regional health boards since 1991 as part of the plan. However, it has emerged that some health boards have disposed of these stocks as they were past their best before date and these boards believed that they were ineffective. I am advised that current stocks held by boards are as follows: Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; 720,000 tested and usable tablets; South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; 360,000 tested and usable tablets; North-Eastern Health Board &ndash; 180,000 tested and usable tablets; North-Western Health Board &ndash; 30,000 untested tablets; Mid-Western Health Board &ndash; 300,000 untested tablets; Midland Health Board &ndash; nil; Western Health Board &ndash; nil; and Southern Health Board &ndash; nil.</P>
    <P>Only the most severe nuclear accidents will require the use of iodine tablets. Ingestion of iodine tablets may be effective in preventing thyroid cancer in certain populations, especially children exposed to radioactive fallout. The necessity of continued stocking of iodine tablets as part of the health input into the national nuclear emergency plan was reviewed as part of an update of the overall plan. It was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I have accepted this recommendation and my Department is making the necessary arrangements as a matter of urgency for tendering and purchasing of new stocks.</P>
    <P>The procedures laid down under Directive 93/36/EEC which allow for an accelerated tendering process for the award of public supply contracts are being followed to purchase these stocks at the earliest possible opportunity. The European Commission has been notified of our invitation to tender for the supply of 10 million iodide or iodate tablets. The deadline for submission of tenders is 13 November 2001. Furthermore, it is proposed to amend the relevant statutory instrument regarding the necessity for a product authorisation for this type of product to allow for quicker replacement of existing stocks.</P>
    <P>With regard to pre-distribution, a number of possible methods are currently under consideration. These include, having a supply delivered to each household or distribution by health boards to households from local health board facilities or pharmacies, or a combination of these. In addition, consideration is being given to health <Col N="169" /> boards and other facilities holding some stocks as a reserve.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> These figures are incomplete, as the information for every community care area is not yet available from the Eastern Regional Health Authority. It should be noted also that these figures can change on a daily basis due to placements becoming available and new cases which may arise.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the working group on foster care was published in May of this year. The report contains a wide range of recommendations designed to ensure that the structures and services necessary to meet the needs of children in foster care, their families and foster carers will be strengthened and further developed.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the report on a phased basis. As part of that commitment the foster care allowance was restructured in August of this year. Discretionary payments for foster carers were abolished and the allowance increased from £71.55, 90.85, to £200, 254, per week for a child under 12 and from £85.75, 108.88, to £220, 279, per week for a child of 12 and over. This payment incorporates the orphans pension and allowances payments. I am confident the new scheme will provide foster carers with an adequate allowance to look after their foster children and encourage others to consider applying to the health boards to undertake fostering.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Social Services Inspectorate has also established a sub-committee to draw up national standards on practices and procedures in foster care, as recommended in the report. In addition, I have requested health boards to submit plans to strengthen and develop services necessary for the full implementation of the report's recommendations. It should also be noted that health boards are undertaking local initiatives on the recruitment of foster carers. These initiatives include prominent displays of promotional materials, advertisements in local media and sponsorship of events organised in conjunction with the Irish Foster Care Association.</P>

As an example of such a change, from 1 April 2001, the maximum rate of the mobility allowance has been increased from a maximum of £45.60, 57.90, per month to a maximum of £90, 114.28, per month.</P>
    <P>It had been envisaged that from 1 April 2001, persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' &ndash; tax concessions &ndash; scheme would be unable to also avail of mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme have access to transport which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I gave further consideration to this proposal in the light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals, and it has now been decided that while the increased rate of up to a maximum of £90, 114.28, per month will, as intended be given only to people who are not also enjoying the tax concessions, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing rate of up to a maximum of £45.60, 57.90, per month.</P>
    <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years. However, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after this age as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; and be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility. My Department is currently undertaking an examination of the disability-related allowances which come under its aegis and are administered by the health boards. In this context, issues relating to the mobility allowance age limits are being considered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the use of the FÁS community employment scheme to provide staff for the Irish Wheelchair Association's resource centres, it is acknowledged that this is not an appropriate method of funding such a service. Discussions are ongoing between officials from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the mainstreaming of <Col N="172" /> health-related services being provided through the community employment scheme, to the health sector.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, just over £92 million, 116.816 million, has been allocated for the ongoing development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including the development and renovation of resource centres. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, and consumers are represented on the co-ordinating committees.</P>

      <P>There are no plans in my Department to introduce a missing child register for parental custody cases such as the one referred to by the Deputy. The Deputy will be aware, however, that details of all children reported to the Garda Síochána as missing are maintained by them for investigative purposes. The provisions of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children deal with cases where children are removed from one contracting state to another, whether subject to a custody order. Such cases are dealt with by the Central Authority for Child Abduction which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Children First, national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children, was published in September 1999 and represent a major development in strengthening arrangements for the protection of children. The objectives of the guidelines are to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse. While the guidelines do not specifically refer to parental custody cases the guidelines are important in this context as they clarify the responsibilities of various professionals and individuals within organisations and provide guidance to enhance communication and co-ordination of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children First clearly recognises that the health boards and the Garda Síochána are the key agencies empowered by law to carry out the assessment and investigation of suspected child abuse. Each agency manages the responsibility within <Col N="173" /> their brief and their joint efforts ensure that the protection of vulnerable children receives priority attention.</P>
    <P>Children First introduces a new Garda-health board protocol for the notification and management of suspected child abuse. This protocol highlights the need to develop liaison channels between the agencies and involve key managers in co-ordinating the activities of personnel. One of the results of this new protocol has been the development of a joint training programme to support its introduction and this inter-agency training is ongoing at present.</P>
    <P>Children First also contains procedures in relation to the transfer of information on children in need of care and protection when families move from one jurisdiction to another.</P>

      <P>The cost of providing medical indemnity cover for obstetricians and public liability insurance cover for hospitals with obstetric services has been of concern for some time. The increase in the cost of this cover reflects the size of the awards made by the courts to infants who suffer brain damage at birth, plus the high legal costs associated with these complex and difficult cases.</P>
      <P>In June one of the two mutual medical defence organisations offering cover in Ireland, the Medical Defence Union, announced that it proposed to charge its obstetric members in Ireland a subscription of £393,000 &ndash; 499,007 &ndash; per annum for those renewing their membership after 1 July 2001. I understand that most, if not all, of the doctors concerned have transferred to the other mutual defence body, the Medical Protection Society, which offers cover to Irish obstetricians for £51,600 &ndash; 65,518 &ndash; per annum.</P>
      <P>The advisory group examining the feasibility of introducing a no-fault scheme for infants who suffer brain damage at, or close to, the time of birth has already held two meetings and a further meeting is to be held on 5 November.

      <P>One of the actions called for in the national alcohol policy published by my Department in 1996 was the development of a campus alcohol policy which would promote sensible drinking among students and limit campus-related drinks industry sponsorship. Following discussions among a number of colleges a working group was established consisting of representatives from 20 third level institutions, the Union of Students in Ireland and the national alcohol policy advisor to the health promotion unit of my Department. The University of Limerick hosted the working group's meetings and the Higher Education Authority also provided support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework for developing a college alcohol policy outlines a comprehensive strategy to enable each third level institution to develop a <Col N="175" /> policy which is suitable to its own requirements. The framework document begins by outlining public health alcohol policy and discusses the college environment and student life within this context. The aims and objectives of a college alcohol policy are described.</P>
    <P>The actual policy formulation process is outlined and the drafting, review and evaluation of an action plan are recommended. Five specific topics for inclusion in the policy document are included. These include issues such as marketing, promotion and sponsorship by drinks companies, activities to limit harm in the drinking environment, increasing awareness and education, encouraging alternatives and choices and finally providing campus support services.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to provide contact details for the local support services around the country and other relevant organisations. Three examples of college alcohol policies, one from NUI, Galway, one from University College Cork and one from Dublin City University are also provided. I am confident that this framework document will be of great assistance to colleges and universities in their development of campus alcohol policies.</P>

      <P>In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July 2001.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; the establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published in April 2000.</P>
      <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an interagency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the South-Eastern Health Board that speech and language therapy services have been temporarily suspended in St. John's school, Dungarvan, due to staff shortages in this area. Where previously the South-Eastern <Col N="178" /> Health Board had two therapists in Dungarvan, it now only has one to cover all areas of service.</P>
    <P>The principal speech and language therapist has met with representatives of St. John's school to discuss this issue and has informed them that in the interim period, a therapist based in the clinic will deal with queries from the school. In the meantime, the board is actively working to fill the vacancy, which was advertised in the national Sunday papers on Sunday, 23 September. The South-Eastern Health Board regrets that it has had to temporarily suspend this service, but has assured my Department that it will be resumed once a second speech and language therapist is recruited for the Dungarvan area.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first <Col N="179" /> instance. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers' Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, four dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority commenced their training this month for specialist in orthodontics qualifications and discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way. Through the Post-graduate Medical and Dental Board, I have also funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry. The post-graduate director will assume his duties in January 2002. The director's role will be to promote and ensure that co-ordinated postgraduate training in dentistry of a high standard is provided.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
      <P>The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million &ndash; 2.971 million &ndash; this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million &ndash; 2.044 million &ndash; was for the orthodontic initiative. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me of the following developments in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: two additional consultant orthodontists, two specialists in orthodontics and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised; a competition to fill the post of dental hygienist in the ECAHB has been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidate is currently in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future; a six-surgery facility at Loughlins<Col N="180" /> town regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping of an additional five-surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards; and validation of their waiting list is currently in progress.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the ERHA that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 3,288 patients in orthodontic treatment and 904 patients awaiting treatment in the authority.</P>

      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency undertook a national survey of nursing vacancies on 31 July 2001. I am arranging for a copy of this survey to be forwarded directly to the Deputy. The survey contains a summary of the vacancy situation in each health board area.</P>
      <P>The survey found that a total of 4,653 nurses were recruited in the year ending 31 July 2001 and that a total of 2,951 resigned-retired-moved to another employer in the same period. Accordingly, the recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving with a net increase of 1,702 nurses in the system.</P>
      <P>The total number of nursing vacancies reported was 1,251. This is a decrease of 5% when compared with the position on 30 April 2001. A total of 416.75 agency nurses were employed every day during the month of July 2001. Excluding three health boards for which figures were not available, it was reported that, nationally, a total of 2,895.05 hours overtime by nurses was used each day during the month of July 2001. This equates with 520 full-time nurses per week.</P>

      <P>Regulation (EC) 1408/71, as amended by Regulation (EC) 2000/83, is the co-ordinating regulation covering the referral of patients abroad for benefits in kind, including hospital treatment. This regulation requires that patients seeking hospital treatment, in a EU member state other than their own, seek prior authorisation from their competent institution &ndash; ERHA-health boards in Ireland's case &ndash; prior to receiving this treatment. The most recent European Court of Justice judgments, in this area, have not changed this position in that they reaffirm the necessity for a person seeking hospital treatment abroad to seek prior authorisation from the relevant health board prior to receiving this treatment.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that due to the specific nature of hospital services member states should not be precluded from restricting the free movement of patients for the receipt of health care where such restrictions can be objectively justified. The risk of seriously undermining the financial balance of a social security system, the objective of maintaining a balanced medical and hospital service open to all and the maintenance of treatment capacity or medical competence on national territory are three such objective criteria set out by the European Court of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the court has ruled that the granting of such an authorisation must be subject to the conditions that the treatment must be regarded as normal in the professional circles concerned and the person's medical condition must require that treatment. In that regard, the court has also ruled that authorisation cannot be refused on the grounds of the treatment not being normal where it is considered that the treatment concerned is tried and tested by international science. In addition, authorisation can only be refused on the grounds of lack of medical necessity where similar or equally effective treatment can be obtained without undue delay in the person's member state. Indeed, there is provision in the current regulations that authorisation may not be refused where a person cannot be given treatment within the time normally necessary for obtaining the treatment in question taking account of the per<Col N="182" /> sons current state of health and the probable course of the disease.</P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that a scheme of prior authorisation must be based on objective, non-discretionary criteria which are known in advance, in such a way as to circumscribe the exercise of the national authorities discretion, so that it is not used arbitrarily. My Department issued directions some time ago outlining the objective criteria which health boards must consider prior to referring patients abroad for treatment.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department, in conjunction with the Attorney General's office, are considering the possible implications of these judgments on the procedures applied by the health boards when referring patients abroad.</P>

      <P>In the year ended 31 December 2000, in excess of 8,000 WTEs were added to the health service. This demonstrates that boards have developed the capability to recruit large numbers of people. The success is the culmination of a range of recruitment and retention programmes, aimed at addressing issues in all the key areas of medical, nursing and paramedical grades. The programmes are designed to meet current demands, and also develop the capacity of the system for the future.</P>
      <P>I have developed a series of nurse recruitment and retention initiatives at a total cost of some £11 million. These include a new scheme of flexible working arrangements from 1 February 2001, under which nurses and midwives may apply to work between 8 and 39 hours per week on permanent part-time basis; abolition of fees and payment of salary to nurses and midwives undertaking back-to-practice courses in return for a commitment to rejoin the public health service; funding of all higher diploma and certificate courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; payment of fees and full salary to nurses-midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice in return for a work commitment to work in the particular area for a period of one year following completion of the course; a new scheme of financial support &ndash; £,6000 grant; 7618 &ndash; for State enrolled nurses &ndash; SENs &ndash; working in the Irish health service wishing to undertake nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom. SENs must commit to working as nurses here following registration with An Bord Altranais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has introduced a new working visa/work authorisation scheme to facilitate the recruitment of nurses from non-EU countries. Since the scheme came into operation in June <Col N="183" /> 2000, more than 2000 visas-authorisations have been issued. This initiative is helping to address the current shortage of nurses, and health service employers are actively seeking to recruit at least a further 1,200 nurses from abroad.</P>
    <P>Increasing the number of training places is a key element of my overall strategy for ensuring a sufficient supply of nurse for our health services into the future. Since 1998 the number of training places available nationally has been increased by more than one third to its present level of 1,547. I am developing plans for the creation of even more training places next year.</P>
    <P>Retention initiatives for medical personnel include the significant improvements in the employment conditions of non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; NCHDs. Specific recruitment initiatives include recruitment drives in Pakistan and India, promoting the Irish health system in Austria and recruitment and exchange programmes in New Zealand and Australia. Domestically there has been further development of relationships with Government agencies such as FÁS to assist on recruitment. Links have also been created with medical and training colleges overseas, with a view to attracting more people to the Irish health service.</P>
    <P>Peter Bacon's report on various paramedic grades will form the basis of a structured approach to long-term workforce planning for these grades. Further developed relationships with third level institutions is resulting in additional place being made available on courses. There are active co-ordinated overseas recruitment drives. Boards provide both information on the incentives to available prospective employees. Ongoing implementation of the expert group on various health professionals is assisting in both recruitment and retention of staff, by enhancing the attractiveness of employment in the Irish health service.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. In addition, persons aged 70 and over are automatically eligible for medical cards.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, the whole issue of eligibility is being examined in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my Department and is expected to be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>In 1999, the World Health Organisation produced a detailed blueprint for an influenza pandemic plan, setting out the issues which arise nationally and internationally in relation to a possible future influenza pandemic. A pandemic would have very serious effects in terms of mortality and morbidity and services such as acute hospitals and general practice would experience greatly increased workloads, well in excess of those seen during more regular outbreaks of influenza.</P>
      <P>Last year I established a committee, chaired by Professor William Hall, director of the virus reference laboratory, to draw up plans to address any future influenza pandemic. I also asked this committee to consider issues which arise in relation to the more regular outbreaks of influenza, and how our health services might best be prepared for these. These issues include prevention strategies, surveillance and early warning systems, scientific and medical issues, vaccination policy, pharmaceutical supplies and logistical matters, hospital and community responses, economic, legal and political concerns, communications and an effective management process.</P>

      <P>The management of waiting lists is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the respective health board or authority and therefore any decision to source facilities abroad is made at local level.</P>
      <P>Arrangements already exist whereby health agencies send patients to the United Kingdom and to the United States where there is not sufficient capacity in their own hospitals to have the procedures carried out and where specific expertise is not available in this country.</P>
      <P>For example, between January and September this year, Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, entered into a contract with agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States for 54 cardiac procedures for children on the waiting list at the hospital. The North Eastern Health Board has contracted both ophthalmology and ENT services in Northern Ireland and last year, under the waiting list initiative and the North Western Health Board entered into a contract with agencies in Northern Ireland for approximately 140 ENT and ophthalmic procedures. These initiatives have contributed to the overall reduction in waiting list figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while patients will continue to be sent abroad for treatment where necessary, it is well recognised that the single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability.

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness outlined the commitment of the Government to review bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. A comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The findings of the review have informed the preparation of the forthcoming national health strategy.</P>
      <P>The overall number of patients on waiting lists at 30 June 2001, as reported by health agencies, was 26,659 a drop of 5,192 or 16% on the comparative figure for 2000. Reductions in waiting lists have been achieved across each of the eight health board regions in the period June 2000 to June 2001.</P>
      <P>The number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for treatment and the number of children waiting more than six months for treatment in the target specialties have both fallen by 20% in the same period. The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no adult waits longer than 12 months and no child waits longer than six months for treatment. Hospital waiting lists must be viewed against the background of a hospital system which discharged some 870,000 in-patients in 2000. The number of people currently on hospital in-patient waiting lists represents just 3% of all in-patient discharges in 2000. I will continue to focus on waiting lists and waiting times in order to ensure that services are available and accessible to those who most need them.</P>

The first report of the working group issued in March 2001 contains recommendations for the expansion and enhancement of services for the management and treatment of children and adolescents with mental illness.</P>
      <P>This year additional revenue funding of £3.225 million, 4.095, has been allocated to provide for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry and for the enhancement of existing multi-disciplinary teams. Capital funding is being provided under the national development plan for the development of the specialist in-patient units for children and adolescents.</P>
      <P>The working group's report also recommended that formal liaison arrangements be developed at local level in each health board area to address linkages with the education system, and the community health services and to utilise where possible shared care with general practitioner services, developmental paediatrics, paediatric neurologists and the adult psychiatric services. These developments, together with the planned expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, are likely to identify children with mental illness who were previously undiagnosed and to increase referrals to the child and adolescent psychiatric services over the coming years.</P>
      <P>Additional resources were provided to the Mental Health Association of Ireland in recent years. The resources have enabled the association to continue the very successful national public speaking project in schools and to develop the mental health resource pack, Mental Health Matters. These initiatives play a significant role in addressing the issue of mental health in a manner appropriate to children and make young people aware of the services and facilities that are available should they or a friend require them. It is hoped that it will encourage people to access professional help sooner and to further de-stigmatise young peoples attitude towards mental illness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the homeless are a high risk group in relation to a number of health conditions, including mental illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Guidelines on Good Practice and Quality Assurance in Mental Health Services produced by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in 1998 set out the discharge policies and procedures which should be in place in each hospital and acute psychiatric unit. A clear discharge plan should be designed for each patient, to ensure that all appropriate information is given and all appropriate services arranged prior to the patient's actual <Col N="189" /> discharge. This includes checking to ensure that the patient has suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>While it is acknowledged that those leaving residential care may be at risk of becoming homeless, research undertaken on former long-stay patients of St. Brendan's Hospital shows that virtually no former long-stay patients have become homeless. New patients presenting to smaller psychiatric units based in general hospitals for psychiatric disorders, often complicated further by alcohol and drug abuse, are deemed to be at much higher risk of becoming homeless.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, a specific mental health programme for the homeless is in place with residential and day facilities together with an outreach programme. Resources have been made available by my Department to the authority in recent years to enable the provision of an additional consultant psychiatrist and the expansion of a multi-disciplinary team which deals specifically with the needs of homeless people who are mentally ill. The Southern Health Board has also been provided with funding to commence the provision of a service to the homeless in Cork. The board has <Col N="190" /> recently advertised for a consultant psychiatrist for the homeless and will recruit other appropriate staff to the service.</P>
    <P>My Department has completed the drafting of a strategy aimed at preventing homelessness among those leaving institutional care. This is due to be published shortly as part of an overall strategy by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The objective of the strategy is to provide guidance to health boards to ensure procedures and policy are in place to reduce the risk of people becoming homeless on leaving institutional care, including arrangements for people leaving psychiatric facilities.</P>

      <P>The subject of surrogacy raises a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues with associated legal, ethical, social and medical implications. In Ireland, surrogacy is not governed by any specific health legislation.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate this area. With a view to addressing these concerns a Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was established in 2000 and is currently preparing a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction. This includes giving consideration to the issue of couples using surrogate births to start a family.</P>
      <P>The commission comprises the medical, scientific and legal expertise necessary for a detailed and informed examination of the issues involved. The commission is required to consult with interested parties including philosophical and theological experts to ensure their perspectives are considered and reflected as appropriate. In addition, the commission recently placed advertisements in the public press inviting submissions from members of the public and other interested bodies including professional and voluntary organisations. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of health and safety in the workplace is one which I consider to be of the highest importance. As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for health and safety in the workplace lies with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through the Health and Safety Authority. I fully support the work of the HSA both in its advisory role on health and safety issues and in the enforcement of health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>As far as health and safety in the health service is concerned, as set out in the HSA's annual report for 2000 there were no fatalities in the health and social work sector. Notwithstanding this, I am continuing to take measures to reduce risks to health and safety and create a safer environment for all those working in the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February 2001 I met the HSA to discuss health and safety issues in the health service and welcomed its plans to step up its ongoing programme of review of health and safety in the health sector. Subsequently, I wrote to the chief executive officer of each health board, reminding it of its obligation to minimise and effectively <Col N="192" /> manage all risks to the health and safety of its employees.</P>
    <P>In May 2001 the Report of the Advisory Committee on Health Services was launched. This is a detailed and comprehensive report encompassing all aspects of health and safety in the health sector, including the critical issue of occupational health and safety. The advisory committee's report which highlights the importance of creating a safety culture within health service organisations will provide the primary basis for my plans to continue to seek to protect and enhance the health and safety of all those working in the health service.</P>
    <P>A further health and safety issue is the threat of violence against health service workers. I consider this a very serious matter. Consequently, last year each health board was asked to submit details of a review of their security arrangements in their accident and emergency units, and to identify deficiencies. Following that review I was able to allocate £1 million to improve security in accident and emergency departments. This money was allocated to address issues such as additional security personnel, installation of CCTV and training of staff in how to handle aggressive patients.</P>
    <P>I have also requested the HSEA to convene an expert working group to develop guidelines on what constitutes an optimum occupational health and safety and welfare service for health care staff. The terms of reference for this group is to develop guidelines which will support health service employers in the development, organisation and operation of a specialist led multidisciplinary occupational health and safety and welfare service for health care staff, and to make recommendations in regard to the setting up, monitoring and evaluation of a pilot site(s). The membership of the group which I expect to report by year end includes representatives of management, unions and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was established in March 2000 with the following terms of reference &ldquo;to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission has met on eight occasions to date. The first meeting was held on 26 July 2000 and the most recent was on 13 September 2001. I <Col N="193" /> understand the commission has adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its work. Initially each discipline &ndash; medical, legal, scientific and social &ndash; prepared a report outlining the current position within that discipline in relation to assisted human reproduction. Working groups were then formed to examine specific topics and issues that needed to be addressed. The working groups meet on a regular basis to discuss their tasks and to progress the work of the commission.</P>
    <P>When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. To inform itself on the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction, the commission recently placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting interested members of the public, professional or voluntary organisations and other parties who wish to do so to make a written submission before Wednesday, 31 October 2001.</P>
    <P>Given the difficult nature of the issues to be examined it is not possible to be definitive about the length of time it will take the commission to complete its work but I am satisfied that it is making significant progress and will continue its work as expeditiously as is feasible. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is well aware that I am about to deliver a new health strategy shortly which will provide a framework for growth and development of our health services over the coming years. Therefore, it should be clear to the Deputy that the entire question of the improved delivery of health services has been the focus of my attention for some time.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that the overall budget for health services for 2001 is more than £5 billion, 6.35 billion. This represents a doubling by this Government of Exchequer input since 1997. The national development plan represents the greatest level of investment in health capital infrastructure, £2 billion, 2.54 billion, at 1999 prices, and is designed to bring benefits to all areas of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth listing some of the benefits of this increased funding across the whole health system. <Col N="194" /> The acute hospital system delivers a service that is ever growing in terms of its volume and complexity. A sum of £1 billion, 1.27 billion, has been provided under the national development plan for the development of hospital infrastructure. This will allow for the provision of major developments in the acute hospital sector in every region of the country. This Government has overseen significant increases in hospital activity levels. In particular there has been a 29% increase in day care activity in hospitals since this Government came into office. The hospital system has continued its high productivity performance in January to June 2001 by recording an overall rise of 5.1% activity increase, including almost 11% growth in day cases. This translates into an extra 22,000 cases treated over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of about 25% in the numbers employed in the health service since this Government came into office. We now have about 83,000 whole-time equivalent staff working in the health service. This includes an additional 250 consultants in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is a comprehensive range of obstetric services available to women on a regional and tertiary basis. However, I am aware of recent difficulties relating to the recruitment and retention of midwives which are impacting on the capacity of maternity hospitals to cope with increasing demands for their services, particularly in the eastern region. I wish to set the record straight on the extent of the midwifery shortages in the Dublin area. Media reports of 110 midwifery posts vacant in the three Dublin maternity hospitals are incorrect. Information received by my Department indicates that while the three hospitals are short 84 midwives, the net vacancy situation is 54 posts, when account is taken of the number of registered general nurses that have been employed by the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have established a special forum to examine the current difficulties being experienced by the Dublin maternity hospitals in relation to the recruitment and retention of midwifes. This forum includes representatives of the three Dublin maternity hospitals, my Department, the Health Service Employers' Agency, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the nursing unions. It held its first meeting on 19 October, and has been asked to report back to me as a matter of urgency. This forum will build on a number of initiatives already taken at national level to recruit and retain midwifes. I assure the Deputy that the provision of a comprehensive, safe and high quality, fully accessible obstetric service will continue to be of the utmost priority.</P>
    <P>More than £60 million, 76.184 million, has been allocated under the National Cancer Strategy since 1997 and an additional 57 consultants together with support staff have been approved. We are now spending an additional £38 million, 48.250 million, on cardiovascular and cardiac surgery services.</P>
    <P>At the invitation of my Department, a group <Col N="195" /> representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    <P>Additional investment of £205 million, 260.35 million, has been made for the period mid 1997 to 2001 on services, both capital and non-capital, for the intellectually disabled and a further £107 million, 135.89 million, for the physically disabled. Additional development funding has increased from £3 million, 3.81 million, in 1997 to £33 million, 41.91 million, this year, excluding funding for nursing home subvention. Since the end of 1997 additional revenue of the order of £92.5 million, 117.475 million, has been allocated for the further strengthening and development of child welfare and protection services.</P>
    <P>Some £34.5 million, 43.805 million, has been allocated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001 to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures. Significant decreases have taken place in the number of patients waiting in the target specialties since June 2000; the number awaiting cardiac surgery is down by 52%, gynaecology is down by 35%, ENT is down by 30%, ophthalmology is down by 23% and orthopaedics is down by 14%. Considerable progress has also been made in reducing waiting times in target specialties. For example, between June 2000 and June 2001 the number of adults waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months decreased by 68%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 38% and the number waiting for orthopaedic services for more than 12 months decreased by 16%. During the same period the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months decreased by 85%, the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by 31% and the number waiting for ENT services for more than six months decreased by 25%.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that the single most important limiting factor for admission to <Col N="196" /> hospital is bed availability. A comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review has focused primarily on the emerging needs to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The review of bed capacity will inform the new health strategy.</P>
    <P>In addition to issues of capacity of services, the new health strategy to which I referred earlier will address issues relating to reform and modernisation of the health system. The strategy will outline the direction and scale of development planned in a number of service and professional areas for example acute hospital bed capacity, primary health care, medical manpower, nursing, etc. In addition, the strategy will include a plan covering the actions required for its implementation in the short, medium and long-term.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the strategic planning and development of the health service. The increased level of capital and non-capital investment which I have outlined is strong evidence of the priority this Government attaches to improving the health services in this country.</P>

      <P>The in-patient waiting list for hospital procedures by speciality, as at the 30 June 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, are being communicated separately to the Deputy. The average waiting time for each specialist is not routinely collated by my Department. Dedicated funding of £74.57 million, 94.68 million, was made available to health agencies between 1997 and 2000 to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and £34.5 million, 43.8 million, has been allocated under the waiting list initiative in 2001.</P>
      <P>The overall number of patients on waiting lists as at the 30 June 2001, as reported by health agencies was 26,659 a drop of 16% on the comparative figure for 2000. The number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for treatment and the number of children waiting for more than six months for treatment in target specialties have both fallen by 20% in the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospital waiting lists must be viewed against the background of a hospital system which discharged some 870,000 in-patients in 2000. The <Col N="197" /> number of people currently on hospital in-patient waiting lists represents just 3% of all in-patient discharges in 2000. I will continue to focus on waiting lists and waiting times in order to ensure that services are available and accessible to those who most need them.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Careers Centre, which is managed by An Bord Altranais, handles arrangements for the annual intakes of students, both school leavers and mature, to the nursing diploma programmes. From this year, in line with a recom<Col N="198" /> mendation of the Commission on Nursing, the application system for places on those programmes is being administered by the Central Applications Office in close co-operation with the Nursing Careers Centre.</P>
      <P>The NCC administered the special requirements for entry to nursing for mature code applicants. Included in the special requirements was a written assessment and a pass-fail interview. The outcome was 717 applicants reaching a satisfactory standard and these were deemed qualified.</P>
      <P>The NCC and the CAO very much regret the error which occurred during the initial offer of places to mature applicants. In round one, approximately 200 applicants who had scored lowest in the application process were erroneously offered preferential places. The error was discovered immediately and following joint discussions between the NCC and the CAO, it was decided firstly to honour the offers made in error and secondly to re-run the file to offer places to all those who were entitled to receive an offer.

      <P>A new national breast cancer helpline established by Action Breast Cancer, a project of the Irish Cancer Society, was officially launched on 1 October last by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, to mark the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This launch also saw the release of the IMS survey referred to by the Deputy, on women's knowledge of breast cancer and their awareness of early detection measures. While it is recommended that women check their breasts once a month for unusual changes, the survey found that only one in three women check their breasts on at least a monthly basis. This survey has armed ABC with considerable knowledge as to how it can direct its efforts to increase women's knowledge of breast cancer and make them more breast aware.</P>
      <P>ABC has been established to provide breast cancer information and support and to fund breast cancer research. During the month of October, ABC is running the &ldquo;Pink Ribbon&rdquo; campaign to promote breast awareness and help fund the cost of its education initiative. Its specially designed breast awareness leaflet provides very clear and comprehensive information on the complete process of becoming breast aware. The new helpline is operated by experienced breast care nurses who have been specially trained to provide expert information and support for those concerned about breast cancer. ABC has also produced information cards, providing a step by step guide on how to look and feel for any changes in the breast. In conjunction with the State agencies and the private sector, it is intended to distribute breast awareness literature free to half a million women countrywide, encouraging them to report any unusual breast changes to their doctors immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the report, Inequalities in Health &ndash; the Hard Facts, found that in 1996 unskilled manual men were twice as likely to die prematurely between the ages of 15 and 64 as men who are higher professionals. A number of reports, including the 1999 report of the chief medical officer, have drawn attention to the links between lower socio-economic position and poor health status.</P>
      <P>This problem must be addressed on a number of fronts &ndash; providing equitable access to health services, including to health education and health promotion, and ensuring that policies outside the health sector take impact on health into account. Many of the factors which lead to the gap in health status lie outside the remit of the health sector. For example, the report to which the Deputy refers found that men in the unskilled manual groups were eight times more likely to die from an accidental cause than men in the highest professional group. Reducing deaths from accidents requires a multi-sectoral approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Higher death rates from cancer and cardio<Col N="201" /> vascular disease, two major causes of premature deaths, also contribute to the difference in health status between higher and lower socio-economic groups.</P>
    <P>There are strategies in place to address both of these diseases. Over £60 million, 76.24 million, has been allocated under the national cancer strategy since 1997, to the benefit of all, including in particular those socio-economic groups at greater relative risk of contracting cancer due to environmental or lifestyle factors. Work has commenced on implementation of the report of the cardiovascular health strategy group. A new health promotion strategy for 2000-05 is being implemented to address the many lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol use and unhealthy eating habits which are more prevalent among lower socio-economic groups.</P>
    <P>The overall budget for health services for 2001 is over £5 billion, 6.35 billion. This represents a 48% increase over the past two years and is a clear recognition of the Government's commitment to provide a high quality health service directed at those most in need. Likewise, a total of £2 billion, 2.54 billion, was made available to the Department of Health and Children at the launch of the national development plan in January 2000 for the period 2000-06. This investment will provide a physical infrastructure to underpin a public health service characterised by ongoing improvements in quality and accessibility and will be a significant ingredient in improving mortality and morbidity of the poorest groups in our society.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy is the Government's major vehicle for addressing the needs of people in poverty or experiencing social exclusion. Although health or health targets were not included in the original NAPS published in 1997, my Department has been involved in setting and reviewing annual work plans for NAPS. More recently the Government gave a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to review the NAPS across all relevant Departments and to develop NAPS targets in the health area with an associated monitoring and implementation framework. My Department established a working group on NAPS and health which included the social partners and the Combat Poverty Agency and sought the assistance of the Institute of Public Health with research and consultation aspects of the exercise.</P>
    <P>An extensive public consultation was carried out and the assistance of the community and voluntary pillar and the Combat Poverty Agency was sought to try to ensure that the consultation was as inclusive as possible of people who are poor or socially excluded. The working group completed its report in July last. The report is currently being integrated with the NAPS reports from other Departments with a view to the adoption by Government of a revised NAPS later this year. Concurrently, the report of the NAPS and the health working group is informing the new national health strategy.</P>

      <Quest>when the expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme was set up; his views on whether nursing home costs and charges have substantially increased; his further views on whether payments under the nursing home subvention scheme are adequate; and if the rates of subvention will be increased immediately.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged are a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>In line with a Government decision on value for money reviews between March 2000 and April 2001, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme was undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. The purpose of this review was to address, <i>inter alia</i>, the following issues: the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme and the extent to which current objectives are being met; the efficiency, effectiveness and equity implications of the current subvention scheme; the need and likely future demand for, and supply of, private nursing home care; and optimal funding arrangements for long-stay care; the major policy questions for the future.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from this expenditure review, taking into account the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I would like to remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million. An additional £14 million has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU law, we cannot intervene in the pricing or underwriting of insurance of any type. The events in New York on 11 September last will lead to greatly increased costs for reinsurers and direct insurers in both Europe and the United States. Unfortunately, this will result in higher premiums for both private and commercial consumers of insurance, including motor insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>The cost of insurance in Ireland has been the subject of extensive research by our Department. It is clear that the high cost of insurance in Ireland is linked to the high cost of claims. This Government has decided to establish a personal injuries assessment board, with a view to reducing the costs of delivery of compensation in personal injury cases. I understand that such costs are now running at in excess of 40% of the cost of claims. An interdepartmental implementation group is considering how the PIAB may be established. It is expected to report at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board is examining the factors that influence the cost of motor insurance and, in particular, the relationship between the premiums being levied to different categories of drivers, including young drivers, and the claims experience of those categories.

The most recent UNAIDS-WHO report on rates of infection shows that there are now 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa in which more than one tenth of the adult population aged 15-49 is infected with HIV. In seven countries, all in the southern cone of the continent, at least one adult in five is living with the virus.</P>
      <P>The unparalleled impact of the pandemic requires an urgent and broad based response by the affected countries and by the international community. Ireland has been to the forefront at international and EU level in urging intensified action to tackle the HIV-AIDS pandemic in Africa. An important international initiative was the first ever UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV-AIDS, UNGASS, which took place in New York from 25-27 June 2001. The concern with which Ireland views the HIV-AIDS pandemic was underlined by the decision of the Taoiseach to personally lead the Irish delegation to the special session.</P>
      <P>At EU level we pressed the European Commission to prepare a programme for accelerated action against HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB. This communication, which was published in September 2000, formed the basis of the new EU policy and action plan to tackle HIV-AIDS, which was adopted by Development Ministers in November 2000. The new policy focuses on a number of key areas, including improving the effectiveness of existing interventions, improving access to medicines and increased research and development. The European Union has also contributed substantially to the global AIDS and health fund, which was agreed at UNGASS. Out of a total commitment of 1.8 billion, more than 1 billion has been pledged by the EU member states and the Commission.</P>

    <P>In the framework of the EU-Africa dialogue, Ireland has also played a leading role on the issue of HIV-AIDS. The Taoiseach spoke about the challenge of HIV-AIDS at the EU-Africa summit in Cairo in April 2000. Ireland has also taken the lead role on behalf of the European Union in the follow-up to the plan of action adopted at Cairo. At the mid-term EU-Africa ministerial conference held in Brussels on 11 October to evaluate progress on the Cairo plan of action, the Mini<Col N="207" /> ster of State, Deputy O'Donnell, led for the EU side on HIV-AIDS. In her intervention, the Minister of State focused on the need for an intensification of the fight against HIV-AIDS in the context of poverty reduction, the need to increase investment to strengthen health systems, the central importance of political leadership for improving health, fighting disease and delivering on commitments to increase the volume of resources for the health sector, and the need to ensure that key pharmaceuticals are made accessible and available to the poor. She also underlined the importance of increasing investment in the research and development of new drugs to fight HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also intensified its bilateral support to eradicate HIV-AIDS. Ireland Aid has adopted a HIV-AIDS strategy, which mainstreams action against the disease into all our development activities. Substantial additional resources have also been made available. At UNGASS, the Taoiseach committed Ireland to spending an additional $30 million per year directly on the fight against HIV-AIDS. Work is now under way to ensure that these additional funds are spent through the most effective channels, including NGOs, our bilateral programme and multilateral organisations.</P>
    <P>In 2000 a total of £6.7 million, 8.5 million, was allocated to the fight against HIV-AIDS activities across the Ireland Aid programme. Ireland Aid has established HIV-AIDS programmes in all six priority countries &ndash; Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Ethiopia &ndash; and in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Ghana. Ireland Aid also funds the efforts of NGOs and missionaries in the fight against HIV-AIDS, as well as UNAIDS and the international AIDS vaccine initiative. The level of Ireland Aid funding for HIV-AIDS activities will to grow sharply over the next few years as the overseas development aid budget expands in line with the Government's commitment to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007.</P>

      <P>The Irish Energy Centre implements initiatives on renewable energy and energy efficiency on behalf of the Department of Public Enterprise. At present it does not provide any direct support at an individual level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, published by my Department in 1999, identified housing as an area requiring major deployment of innovation to improve its energy performance and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Following on from the Green Paper, in <Col N="208" /> September of this year, I launched the RD&amp;D House of Tomorrow programme which will be administered on my behalf by the Irish Energy Centre. The house of tomorrow programme offers support for research, development and demonstration projects aimed at generating and applying technologies, products, systems, practices and information leading to more sustainable energy performance in Irish housing. The main focus of the programme is on stimulating widespread uptake of superior energy planning, design, specification and construction practices in both the new home building and home improvement markets. The programme has a proposed budget of 21.1 million, £16.6 million, over the period 2001-06.</P>
    <P>The programme will include three specific strands aimed at enhanced best practice and innovation in housing. The first of these will stimulate the design, development and construction of new housing across the country that will successfully incorporate energy efficient planning, design and construction practices superior to building regulations, Part L, requirements, acting as model examples to the new homes market as a whole. The second will produce a set of model examples of new housing across the country that incorporate superior new &ndash; or substantially new to the Irish market &ndash; energy technologies and practices in their planning, design, construction and energy systems, achieving energy and COf8&gt;2 performance significantly superior to building regulations, Part L, requirements, and thereby help stimulate significant early uptake of such superior systems and practices in Ireland's new homes market. The adoption of more integrated sustainable energy design approaches is particularly encouraged. The third strand aims to generate and demonstrate innovating cost-efficient energy retrofit strategies, systems and products designed for Ireland's pre-1980 housing stock, acting as model examples to stimulate widespread uptake of similar practices across Ireland's home improvement market as a whole. These three strands together aim to support a total of 2,500 new build homes and the retrofitting of 500 homes with specific support funding and within regional spread criteria already set down.</P>
    <P>Within these particular strands triple glazing and active solar space heating are among a long list of technologies that may qualify for support as part of an overall and comprehensive project selection and qualification process. However, I must emphasise that in all cases the programme will seek to support collectives of more than five dwellings. Therefore, no direct support at individual level is available or envisaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration of legal means to bring about the closure of Sellafield, in its entirety, has been on the agenda of Government for very many years. We now have, for the first time, the possibility of preventing the commissioning of a new plant at Sellafield &ndash; the MOX plant.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a contracting party to a number of international conventions and agreements which deal with aspects of nuclear energy and the operation of nuclear installations. While it has been the Government's stated aim to seek the closure of Sellafield, the international conventions and agreements in question do not provide mechanisms for seeking the closure of nuclear installations. Rather, they focus on the issues of protection of the environment and operational safety.</P>
      <P>Ireland has always sought to avail of these conventions to ensure that operations at nuclear facilities, such as Sellafield, are closely monitored, with a view to ensuring the highest safety standards of operation and to addressing the environmental and health concerns that we have about such facilities.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided to initiate a case against the UK under the OSPAR Convention last May, on grounds of justification of the proposed Sellafield mixed oxide &ndash; MOX &ndash; plant and, secondly, on freedom of access to information regarding the MOX plant.</P>
      <P>The Government's view is that the information made available does not provide a basis for concluding that the MOX plant is justified within the meaning of EU Directive 80/836/EURATOM as amended by Directive 84/467. This directive requires that any activity involving exposure to radiation shall be justified in advance by the net benefits it produces. Furthermore, the Government is also considering legal actions at European Court level and under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.</P>
      <P>As well as the OSPAR Convention and EU directives, Ireland is also a contracting party to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. Both of these conventions will have review meetings in the coming months, and Ireland will be seeking to ensure that all the provisions in these conventions are fully applied to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The Government remains resolved to remove the threat to Ireland posed by the Sellafield plant. The cessation of all activities at Sellafield remains a priority for the Government and we will pursue every possible means, diplomatic and legal, to achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>There are international and EU notification procedures in place in the event of a nuclear accident. The International Atomic Energy Agency Convention on early notification of a nuclear accident and the European Community decision on the rapid exchange of information in the event of a nuclear accident provide for early warning of an accident and for the exchange of information. Both involve the rapid transmission of data to a designated national contact point which in Ireland is the Garda Communications Control Centre.</P>
      <P>These procedures are designed to provide essential information as quickly as possible. Once notification is received by the Garda communications centre, the latter contact the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland who then make the first decision as to whether the accident is of a scale that requires the activation of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents.</P>
      <P>There are also bilateral arrangements between Ireland and the UK for some years now whereby they notify us of accidents or incidents particularly those which involve off-site release of radioactive materials.</P>
      <P>As to the emergency response plans in Ireland, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 85 on 17 October 2001 when I outlined details of the Government's national emergency plan for nuclear accidents.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to publish the up-dated version of the plan towards the end of the year. I also intend to circulate to every household a summary of the plan. In the meantime, recognising that there is a public need for information on countermeasures in the event of an accident, my Department will be placing an advertisement in the national and provincial press giving essential advice on these countermeasures which is simple, practical and effective.</P>

      <P>At the request of the Taoiseach, I am chairing the emergency planning task force to oversee emergency planning in light of the current international climate.</P>
      <P>The task force held its first meeting on Thursday, 18 October 2001, at which the Taoiseach attended, along with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> The task force comprises senior representatives from all the key Departments and agencies charged with responsibility for emergency planning, including those with responsibility for the provision of a response to incidents suspected of involving anthrax. The Garda Síochána, Defence Forces and emergency services roles in response to such incidents are as set out in the agreed protocol for dealing with suspected anthrax in Ireland, as published by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The task force has been meeting regularly every two days to review the various emergency planning and response issues and met again on Monday, 22 October and yesterday, Wednesday, 24 October and will meet again tomorrow, Friday, 26 October. Further meetings are scheduled for next week.</P>
    <P>In relation specifically to the incidents involving suspected anthrax my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on Wednesday, 17 October 2001, issued a protocol for dealing with such incidents. This protocol was prepared by an expert committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, Director, Virus Reference Laboratory. This committee was established to develop a contingency plan which would be activated in the unlikely event of a biological incident. While work on the detailed plan is progressing a specific protocol to deal with suspected anthrax incidents was prepared first in light of the recent events in the United States.</P>
    <P>The protocol deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax incident including the treatment of persons involved, the management of incidents and post exposure guidelines.</P>
    <P>The protocol is a work in progress and is being revised on an ongoing basis as a result of feedback to the committee. The most recent version of the protocol and guidelines are available on the Department of Health and Children website at www.doh.ie.</P>
    <P>The revised protocol was circulated to key services including the Fire Service, the Garda, the Defence Forces and the director of public health in each health board.</P>
    <P>In relation to treatment in the event of exposure to anthrax the Irish Medicines Board has confirmed that sufficient quantities of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin have been secured and that this would be used to treat patients in the event of exposure.</P>
    <P>Persons suspected of being exposed are being decontaminated. Contaminated areas are being sealed off pending analysis of the sample. Results are communicated to the Public Health Laboratory who notify the relevant director of public health who in turn notify the Garda. Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that persons who may have been in contact with suspected substances are notified of the results of the tests.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this emergency planning task force and the setting up of an office of emer<Col N="213" /> gency planning at the Department of Defence on 2 October and the ongoing work being done by Departments and agencies clearly shows the serious commitment of the Government to providing a co-ordinated and effective response to situations such as those that have arisen recently.</P>
    <P>I commend the work being carried out by the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, the fire and ambulance services and others in responding to the recent incidents. These have placed considerable demands on the resources of our front line emergency services.</P>
    <P>I must add that I deplore the waste of resources on hoax calls to the emergency services which also causes concern and anxiety among the public and I wish to re-emphasis that the full rigours of the law will be applied to anyone convicted of offences relating to hoax calls.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The main element in the EU Commission's proposals for reform of the sheep meat regime is that the current variable ewe premium should be replaced by a fixed premium of 21. Discussions on these proposals have been taking place over the past few months and the opinion of the European Parliament is awaited. In these discussions I have been pressing for the fixed premium to be set at a level which ensures a reasonable income for sheep producers and bears some relationship with the rate of premium payable in other sectors. It is expected that negotiations will be concluded next month and I will be pressing our case to have the premium fixed at the optimum level and for the best possible support regime for Irish sheep producers in the course of these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made strong representations to the EU Commission and to the Council of Ministers on a number of occasions regarding the introduction of an extensification premium in the sheep sector. The Commission has not been prepared to accede to this request, however, and there has been no <Col N="216" /> support for an extensification premium from other member states. I am again pursuing the question of an extensification premium in the context of the reform of the regime.</P>

    <P>My main objective in introducing significant changes to the operation of the milk quota regime in Ireland in April 2000 was to ensure that milk quota was permanently transferred at a reasonable price to active committed producers, particularly those in the small and medium size categories. The outcome of the 2001 restructuring scheme is extremely satisfactory especially when it is taken into account that many milk producers, who wished to sell their quota, could not do so because of the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
    <P>The quantity of milk quota restructured in Ireland since I introduced the new regime is over 360 million litres or almost 80 million gallons. In excess of 88% of this quota has been sold to the small and medium sized producers. Furthermore, the price of restructured quota has been reduced by 20% since 1999. The satisfactory outcome of these schemes will enable small and medium sized dairy farmers to operate their dairying enterprise in a much more efficient and effective manner.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain-type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system, regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows; more severely handicapped, lowland, £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped, lowland, £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; and mountain-type land £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid £1,638.50 on 24 October 2001 in respect of 36.41 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. This compares with his average headage payment of £1,415.00 over the years 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have now been submitted to the European Com<Col N="219" /> mission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposal involves making a payment of £80 per hectare on the first 10 hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will take effect in the current year.</P>

      <P>The Objective One, BMW, region was allocated 1,253.3 million, £987.1 million between 2000-06 in EU structural funds assistance. The Peace II operational programme provides further structural fund assistance to the BMW region of 106 million, £83.5 million; therefore the total structural fund contribution to the BMW region is 1,359.3 million, £1,070.5 million. The southern and eastern region, which is referred to as the Objective One in transition region, has been allocated financial assistance from the structural funds of 1,812.8 million, £1,427.7 million. The larger amount for the southern and eastern, S&amp;E, region reflects the region's higher population. On a <i>per capita</i> basis the figures are 1,360.3, £1,071.3, for the BMW region and 652.4 £513.8 for the S&amp;E region. There is further EU financial assistance of 567.4 million, £446.9 million, available from the Cohesion Fund and 42.8 million, £33.7 million under the trans-European networks, TENS, funds, these are provided for projects at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards community initiatives, the INTERREG III programmes, which run from 2000-2006 provide assistance for cross Border programmes, Strand A, and trans-national programmes, Strands B and C, to Ireland. The most significant of these are the INTERREG IIIA pro<Col N="220" /> grammes with the BMW region receiving funding from the Ireland-Northern Ireland programme of 53.6 million, £42.2 million, and the S&amp;E region receiving 17.8 million, £14 million from the Ireland-Wales INTERREG programme. The total amount of funding available to Ireland under the trans-national programmes, Strands B and C, is 17.5 million, £13.8 million.</P>
    <P>There are three other community initiatives: Equal, Leader+ and Urban. The total amount of EU financial assistance payable to Ireland under these initiatives in the period 2000-2006 is 85.5 million, £67.3 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 to 133, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit is that each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons. Consequently, as each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes, credits and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. The position of married couples in relation to income tax is accorded recognition through the married person's tax credit and the home carer's tax credit.</P>
      <P>I initiated in Budget 2000 the process of widening the standard rate income tax band. When the process is complete the position of all couples will be the same with respect to the standard rate tax band. Every income earner will have his-her own non-transferable standard rate tax band regardless of marital status.</P>
      <P>The home carer's credit was introduced in the Finance Act, 2000, in respect of those spouses of married one-income families who work in the home caring for children, the aged or incapacitated persons. It may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed for tax and where one spouse, the home carer, cares for one or more dependant persons. The home carers credit cannot be claimed by co-habiting couples, as individuals who are not married cannot opt for joint assessment.</P>
      <P>From 1 January 2002 tax relief for home loan interest will no longer be given through the tax system but will instead be granted at source. This means that the tax relief element on the mortgage interest will be built into the monthly mortgage repayment, that is, the monthly repayment will be reduced by the amount of the tax credit. The tax relief at source, TRS, system will result in an extension of the current relief to persons who have qualifying loans but do not get any relief at present because they do not pay tax. Under the TRS arrangements, a person who pays no income tax will benefit from the same reduced interest payment arrangements as someone who is a taxpayer. In effect, this means that from 1 January 2002, a cohabiting couple who jointly own their home and where only one member of the couple has a taxable income, will each benefit.</P>
      <P>The issue of the tax treatment of cohabiting couples was examined in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group, which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in May 1997, reported in August 1999 &ndash; the report is available from the Government Publications Office. The group was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group acknowledged that a key issue in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting <Col N="222" /> couples is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law on the matter. For that reason, while I am cognisant of the issues faced by cohabiting couples, I have no plans to extend the married person's tax credit to such couples at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In Budget 2000, I made substantial changes to the capital acquisitions tax, CAT, legislation which apply to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 December 1999. The measures included the introduction of a &ldquo;dwelling house&rdquo; relief which provides that the transfer of a home will be exempt from CAT subject to the following conditions; that the home is the principal private residence of the recipient and the recipient has been living in the home for the three years prior to the transfer. Where the house has replaced other property, this condition may be satisfied where the recipient has continuously occupied both properties as his or her only or main residence for a total period of three out of the four years immediately prior to the transfer. The recipient must not have an interest in any other residential property. The recipient must own and reside in the house for six years after the transfer. The relief will be withdrawn where the recipient sells or otherwise disposes of the house within the six years. However, where the recipient sells the home within the six years and invests some or all of the proceeds in a replacement home and continuously occupies both homes for a total period of six out of the seven years commencing on the date of the transfer, the clawback will be limited to any proceeds not reinvested in the replacement home. This six year condition will not apply to recipients over 55 years of age and provision will also be made for those circumstances where the recipient is unable to comply with the residence requirement for reasons outside their control, that is, due to hospitalisation or work obligations.</P>
      <P>Once all of the above conditions are met, there will be no CAT liability on the transfer of a home regardless of the nature of the relationship between the disponer and the recipient. This relief is available in addition to the Group III exemption threshold of £15,840 which applies to gifts and inheritances between non-relatives. Where an individual has received previous gifts or inheritances since 2 December 1988, from a Group III source, the value of these benefits must be taken into account for the purposes of determining the current, if any, liability to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that this particular measure should remove the CAT burden on the gift or <Col N="223" /> inheritance of the home for many people, including those in family and personal relationships who are otherwise treated as strangers under the CAT law. Finally, the significant package of measures contained in Budget 2000 constitutes the biggest single easement in the structure of CAT since its introduction in 1976. I consider that the &ldquo;dwelling house relief&rdquo; when taken in conjunction with the other measures introduced, in particular the single 20% rate, will reduce the CAT liability for all beneficiaries. I replaced the old higher rates of 30% and 40% with the single rate as I considered that the previous rates would have imposed a considerable burden in circumstances where the thresholds are exceeded by relatively modest amounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the position in relation to gift tax is as follows. Under section 58 of the Capital Acquisitions Act, 1976, the receipt of support and maintenance, in money or money's worth, by a dependent relative, as defined under section 466 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, of a disponer will not be considered a gift or inheritance in certain circumstances. These are that the support and maintenance is received during the lifetime of the disponer and that the provision of such support or maintenance would be considered part of the normal expenditure of a person in the disponer's circumstances and is reasonable having regard to the disponer's financial position.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, it should be noted that, gifts or inheritances received by a person, which in aggregate remain under the relevant tax-free threshold, would not attract capital acquisitions tax. In this case, therefore, and subject to the proviso that the person in question has received no prior gifts or inheritances since 2 December 1988 from disponers in the same group, that is, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, he or she could receive an amount up to £31,680, 40,225, from an aunt without incurring a CAT liability.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners have specific powers under section 44 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, to deal with individual hardship cases and depending on the circumstances, to postpone, remit or compound tax due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding donations by way of covenants is as set out below. The taxes legislation provides that where an individual, the covenantor, draws up a deed of covenant in favour <Col N="224" /> of another individual, the covenantee, who is aged 18 years or older and is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity, or is a minor child, other than a child of the covenantor, who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity, or is aged 65 years or over, he or she is entitled to an income tax deduction, at his or her marginal rate of tax, in respect of the payments made under the terms of the deed. He or she must however deduct tax at the standard rate from the gross payments made to the covenantee and account to revenue for the tax so deducted.</P>
    <P>The gross payments are taxable in the hands of the covenantee but he or she is entitled to a credit for the standard rate tax deducted from the payments.</P>
    <P>To be effective for tax purposes, a deed of covenant must provide for payments to be made for a period capable of exceeding six years. A once off amount of capital gifted by an individual to another individual would not qualify for income tax relief.</P>
    <P>It would be possible for an aunt to draw up a deed of covenant in favour of a niece who is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity. As explained above, the deed would have to provide for payments to be made for a period capable of exceeding six years. The precise tax savings involved would depend on (a) the rate of tax at which the covenantor is liable on her total income from all sources, and (b) the level of the covenantee's income from all sources.</P>
    <P>If the covenantor is liable to tax at the higher rate she will receive tax relief on the payments made at the difference between the standard rate of tax and the higher rate of tax. There is no tax benefit to a covenantor who pays tax at the standard rate only.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the covenantor's situation, a covenantee whose total income from all sources, including the gross payments received under the deed of covenant, is less than the relevant exemption limit, £3,034, 3,852, for a single person for the tax year 2001, will qualify for a refund of the standard rate tax deducted by the covenantor.</P>

      <P>The provision of health and personal social services, including personal assistance services, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Additional funding allocated to the health boards for the development of such services will be in the context of the total amount of funding allocated for the development of services in the physical and sensory disability sector. Other <Col N="225" /> priorities for service developments in the sector will also be taken into consideration when allocating this funding.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office in 1997, just over £107 million, 135.86 million, has been allocated by this Government for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This year I allocated an additional £12 million, 15.237 million, rising to £24 million, 30.474 million, in the year 2002, for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. I decided that of this, £5 million, 6.349 million, rising to £10 million, 12.697 million in the year 2002 will be targeted at home supports, including £2.5 million, 3.174 million, with a full year cost of £6 million, 7.618 million, for personal assistance services. This means that over 2001-02, funding is being provided for an additional 312 personal assistants to provide a service to approximately 230 clients. Including the £10.5 million, 13.332 million already invested in these services since 1997, a total of £20.5 million, 26.03 million, ongoing funding is being made available for the home support services, including personal assistance services. I wish to assure the Deputy that providing the relevant support services to enable people with physical and services to live as independently as possible will remain one of my priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to give a precise figure for the number of long stay beds that will be required over the next decade. It is possible, however, to outline some of the considerations and issues to be taken into account when formulating policy for the development of long stay policy over that period.</P>
      <P>There will be continued growth in the population aged 65 years and over, and the expectation is that this cohort will have increased by 25% between 1996 and 2011. The 1998 report &ldquo;The Years Ahead. . . A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo;, outlined a number of key principles, one of which was &ldquo;to provide high quality hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home&rdquo;. &ldquo;A Review of the Years Ahead&rdquo;, published in 1997, by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, concluded that, although some progress had been made, significant gaps remained, particularly relating to the lack of support for older people in their homes and in their communities.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, this Government has allocated significant funding to the development of services for older people, with particular emphasis being placed on the development of a comprehensive range of community supports, in order to maintain older people independent in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. It is intended to prioritise this development in the coming years and the success, or otherwise, of this approach will have a direct impact on the demand for extended care. Another factor which must be taken into account is the level of dependency occurring in people as they get older. International evidence would suggest that, as life expectancy increases, the age at which people suffer bad health also increases, with consequent implications to the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>In 1984, the Government approved a framework for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies. The purpose was to establish common procedures in each of the front-line emergency services for activating emergency plans and co-ordination, control and co-operation during peacetime emergencies.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and each of the health boards has an emergency plan which is based on this framework. The main aim of the plans is to ensure that the health service is in a position to mobilise all necessary and available resources and to utilise these to best advantage so that the resulting response will be appropriate, structured, co-ordinated and effectively managed. The emergency plan can be activated by the ambulance service, fire service or the Garda. In the case of the health services, the ambulance controllers notify designated hospitals in the health board area in which the emergency plan is activated.</P>
      <P>The principal functions of the health services at the site of an incident include assessment, triage, treatment, transport, safety and communications.</P>
      <P>At hospital level the emergency plan is designed to deal with the receipt and treatment of patients in the event of the occurrence of a major incident. The aim is to ensure that hospitals are in a position to mobilise all necessary and available resources and to utilise these to the best advantage in order to provide appropriate treatment to incoming casualties.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the ERHA and the health boards are in the process of establishing a national group to review all aspects of major emergency planning in the health context. This review will inform the need for any revision to the existing plans. Future responsibility for overseeing the major emergency planning function will be assumed by the new health board executive, HeBE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> In addition, and at my request, a committee under the chairmanship of the Director of the Virus Reference Laboratory was recently established to prepare an operational plan which would be implemented in the event of a biological attack on this country. This committee recently prepared a protocol for dealing with suspected cases of anthrax in Ireland. The protocol deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected release of anthrax and in particular patient treatment and management, post exposure guidelines etc. Included with the protocol are guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with suspect packages believed to contain anthrax.</P>
    <P>The protocol is a work in progress and is being revised on an ongoing basis as a result of feedback to the committee. The protocol and guidelines are available on my Department's website www.doh.ie.</P>
    <P>In the event of a nuclear incident, the role of the health services under the national nuclear emergency plan relates primarily to the following areas: determining health problems and issuing of medical advice, provision of medical services at designated hospitals for contaminated persons including whole body monitoring, provision of ambulance services to transport injured persons to hospitals, collecting food samples for analysis by the Radiological Protection Institute, seizure and destruction of contaminated milk and foodstuffs and stocking and distribution of stable iodine tablets should this be necessary.</P>
    <P>Only the most severe nuclear accidents will require the use of iodine tablets. Ingestion of iodine tablets may be effective in preventing thyroid cancer in certain populations, especially children exposed to radioactive fallout. The necessity of continued stocking of iodine tablets as part of the health input into the national nuclear emergency plan was reviewed as part of an update of the overall plan which is co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise. It was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I have accepted this recommendation and my Department is making the necessary arrangements as a matter of urgency for tendering and purchasing of new stocks. The procedures laid down under Directive 93/36/EEC which allow for an accelerated tendering process with regard to the award of public supply contracts are being followed to purchase these stocks at the earliest possible opportunity. The European Commission has been notified of our invitation to tender for the supply of ten million iodide or iodate tablets. The deadline for submission of tenders is 13 November 2001. Furthermore, it is proposed to amend the relevant statutory <Col N="229" /> instrument regarding the necessity for a product</P>
    <P>authorisation for this type of product to allow for quicker replacement of existing stocks.</P>

    <P>Patients are referred for secondary care orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department that prioritise need for treatment based on the degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients but have a definite need of treatment and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have also informed me of the following information on orthodontic assessment and treatment waiting lists for the past three years:</P>

      <P>The question of developing an orthopaedic service at Mayo General Hospital is a matter for consideration for the Western Health Board in the context of the funding available for the development of acute hospital services in 2002.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the administration of health services in the Belmullet area is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the Western Health Board. I have made inquiries of the board in relation to the matter raised and am informed that the senior physiotherapist in Belmullet District Hospital took up duty on 3 September 2001. The post is designated to provide physiotherapy services to in-patients, both short-stay and long-stay, at the hospital. There is currently no separate physiotherapist employed to deal with out-patients. All patients are evaluated in order to determine the level of physiotherapy service required by the in-patient population. Arrangements are being made to review this evaluation, with the involvement of the senior physiotherapist, the director of nursing and the medical officer. If it emerges from the review that there is physiotherapy time available, an out-patient service will be introduced.</P>

Costs will depend on a number of factors including the level of demand and the number of patients in each health board availing of the scheme. I will write to the Deputy when the full information he has sought is available. There are logistical implications for the boards in implementing the new arrangements, including assessment and distribution issues. However, I have asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to put the necessary arrangements in place. In the meantime, incontinence wear should still be supplied by private nursing home owners as provided for in Article 16.1 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>

      <P>Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association submitted a report to my Department which identified a need to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new therapies for many disorders becoming available.</P>
      <P>Comhairle Na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the health Acts, and to specify qualifications for such appointments. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to such services.</P>
      <P>Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle Na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle na nOspidéal has established a committee with the following terms of reference:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle Na <Col N="233" /> nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.</P>
    <P>The need for additional investment in the neurological and neurosurgical service will be considered in the light of the review by An Comhairle, other competing priorities, and the availability of adequate funding.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the provision of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. This commitment is evidenced by the fact that additional funding of over £107 million, 135.89 million, has been provided since 1997 for the maintenance and development of services in this sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 to 152, inclusive, and 155 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medical Council is the authority responsible for the provision of registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The council protects the interests of the public when dealing with registered medical practitioners. The principal roles of the council include assuring the quality of undergraduate education and postgraduate training, registering doctors, disciplinary procedures and providing guidance on professional standards and ethical conduct. It is the policy of the Medical Council that all non-consultant hospital doctors should be in posts which have been accredited for training purposes and both the council and the training bodies are actively addressing this requirement.</P>
      <P>A meeting was held earlier this week involving officials of my Department, the key statutory agencies, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland and representatives of the chief executive officers of the health boards/health authorities. Current issues in relation to service provision, training standards and quality assurance within the public hospital service were discussed. It was agreed to prepare proposals for addressing these issues which will be the subject of consideration at a further meeting of the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 is currently under review. The review being carried out takes into consideration various developments in the medical field and the role of the Medical Council and other statutory bodies. The revised Medical Practitioners Act will take account of the concerns raised in the course of consultations, including issues concerning registration.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent statements made by the Irish Medical Organisation arising from the ongoing difference in interpretation regarding the application of overtime rates. I met the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the ongoing implementation of the NCHD 2000 Agreement earlier this year and the overtime issue has also been the subject of correspondence with the Irish Medical Organisation in the interim. Throughout this period I have requested that the matter should be referred to the Labour Relations Commission for its considered view. Both the HSEA and the Department of Health and Children agree to accept the outcome of such clarification <Col N="235" /> by the LRC. I am anxious to have this issue resolved at an early date.</P>
      <P>I highlight that £90 million in additional funding has been allocated to NCHDs in the current year. There has been and will continue to be very significant investment in the terms and conditions applicable to NCHDs.</P>

In this regard, I see the development of out of hours co-operatives as a significant move towards improving both the quality of life of the rural doctor and the quality of care of the patient. Support is also provided for rural doctors through the payment, in some instances, of rural practice allowances and a range of practice support measures in respect of nursing and secretarial staff is also available.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of a magnetic resonance imaging service to eligible persons rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. A comprehensive service is available for public patients requiring access to this service. In the public system MRI facilities are available at Beaumont, St. James's, and Tallaght hospitals in Dublin and the University College Hospital, Galway. I was pleased to provide £5.8 million &ndash; 7.36 million &ndash; in May 2000 for the provision of additional MRI facilities in public hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Children's Hospital, Temple Street and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, Dublin, have both opened MRI facilities recently. In both cases these scanners were purchased and installed through voluntary fundraising and I understand that the East<Col N="236" /> ern Regional Health Authority is contributing funding towards the revenue cost involved. In addition, I understand that a privately run MRI scanning service is available in Cork and at a number of private hospitals. These additional facilities are accessed by the public hospital system.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between public and private health care providers is an established feature of our health care system and one which I fully support in the interests of providing a comprehensive and accessible service to public patients. The continued development of this link will be an important feature of the forthcoming national health strategy.</P>

      <P>The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery is the statutory agency with responsibility for the post-registration development of nursing and midwifery. In particular, it is responsible for monitoring the ongoing development of nursing and midwifery specialities, including advanced nurse practitioner and advanced midwife practitioner posts, taking into account changes in practice and service need. The national council has issued clear guidelines to all health service providers on the process by which clinical specialist and advanced practitioner posts should be developed.</P>
      <P>The national council is working closely with the health boards, mainly through the nursing and midwifery planning and development units, which have regional responsibility for the strategic planning of nursing and midwifery services, to encourage the development of specialist nursing and advanced nursing practitioner posts. Part of the process set out in the national council's guidelines involves the health service provider submitting a plan for the creation of any such posts to the relevant nursing and midwifery planning and development unit for consideration. This is to ensure that there is a coherent approach at regional level to the development of nursing specialities.</P>
      <P>I am fully supportive of the new clinical career pathway now available for nurses and midwives who wish to remain in clinical practice. They now have an opportunity to develop specialist clinical nursing skills which will enable them to respond to future challenges in health care, for the benefit of patients and client groups of the health services.</P>

      <P>The operation of risk management, clinical audit and other quality assurance systems depends to a degree on the confidentiality of the data collected and the processes used to evaluate them. Effective risk management systems require individual practitioners to voluntarily report incidents and near misses in which they were involved. Experience elsewhere suggests that the fear of disclosure is a major impediment to voluntary reporting. Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation to exempt peer review activities from freedom of information legislation. The issue of what protection needs to be offered in Ireland is being examined.</P>

It must be acknowledged that there are several existing initiatives aimed at the sexual health of young people, for example, relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education; SPHE, curriculum within the school setting., the national Youth Health Programme &ldquo;Too Hot to Handle' training for youth workers, the&ldquo;Convenience Advertising Campaign&rdquo; specifically targeting youth entertainment venues in the most disadvantaged areas and individual health boards funding NGO's to deliver sexual health programmes to young people at a regional level, for example, the Alliance Centre for Sexual Health in Cork. The campaign spend to date has been £378,173.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the revised foster care allowance scheme was introduced in August of this year. The introduction of the new scheme was designed to achieve the same objectives as the recommendations in the Report of the Working Group on Foster Care which were to provide foster carers with an adequate allowance to look after their foster children and that all foster children be treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children in respect of whom these payments are made are taken into care by the health board either on a voluntary basis or by court order, and placed in foster care, either under the Child Care (Placement of children in foster care) Regulations, 1995, or the Child Care (Placement of children with relatives) Regulations, 1995, and <Col N="242" /> the health board, therefore, has the corporate responsibility for the care and protection of these children. Under the regulations a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster carers and draw up a child care plan for that child. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether they are relative or non-relative carers. It was in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children that the new scheme was introduced.</P>
    <P>In contrast the orphan's payments scheme operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is designed as an income support scheme. The two schemes are designed to meet different needs. It would therefore be inappropriate to standardise them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 179 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for <Col N="243" /> speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015 was published on 25 July last.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. Other key recommendations of the report include provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the Report of the Expert Group on Various Health Professions &ndash; published April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority &ndash; HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>
    <P>I have contacted the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority who is responsible for identifying the requirement for speech and language therapists in the health service in Kildare through the service planning process. The chief executive officer of the ERHA will be in direct contact with the Deputy to advise him of relevant service developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>In recent years, my Department has provided significant additional funding for health boards for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams in the mental health area and the development of new teams in both the adult and the child and adolescent mental health services. The Deputy may wish to note the 35% &ndash; an additional 96 &ndash; increase in psychology staff since 1996.</P>
      <P>I am aware in the context of work carried out by my Department along with health service employers and IMPACT on the joint review group on psychology services in the health service that shortages of psychology staff exist in the health service. The review group identified that a key factor in this resource shortage was the inadequate number of postgraduate training places available.</P>
      <P>A workforce planning exercise carried out under the aegis of the review group recommended the provision of approximately 30 additional postgraduate training places in psychology. Following a competitive bidding process initiated by my Department these additional places are being provided in the current year through the Psychological Society of Ireland's postgraduate diploma course. It is intended, subject to the availability of appropriate resources, to support a similar process in order to maintain this increased level of training places next year.</P>
      <P>There are a number of unfilled psychology posts in the Kildare mental health service. However, I have been informed by the South-Western Area Health Board that measures are being taken to fill these posts as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;adequacy of community care services with particular reference to the need for the provision of sufficient social workers to meet current demands&rdquo; is being interpreted to mean the <Col N="245" /> adequacy of social work services in the child care and family support area.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties in relation to the recruitment and the retention of qualified and experienced social work staff and the increasing workload for existing staff in this area. Developments currently under way both at national level and at individual health board level will, I believe, help to address these issues. These developments will result in additional services being made available, significant improvements in working conditions for staff and a resulting improvement in services for children.</P>
    <P>At national level, the report of the expert group on various health professions, published in April 2000, made recommendations on a range of personnel issues for social workers. The implementation process is ongoing and, in tandem with this process, a national social work forum has been established to progress a number of key issues of concern for social workers, including those arising from the recommendations of the expert group. These include the introduction of a new grade of senior social work practitioner, the upgrading of single handed and certain other specialised posts, a workload management study and the facilitation of a planned personal and management development programme for the social worker profession. These measures should contribute to greater job satisfaction and the consequent better retention of personnel.</P>
    <P>In addition, following the publication in June 2000 of the report by the National Social Work Qualifications Board, Social Work Posts in Ireland, discussions have been ongoing between officials of my Department, the Department of Education and Science, and the Higher Education Authority regarding the provision of additional training places for social workers. A considerable expansion in provision has been agreed, with an extra 35 places being provided for in the current academic year and a further 50 places planned for the following academic year, to bring the total number of places available to some 194 with effect from the 2002-03 academic year. The National Social Work Qualifications Board is currently undertaking a follow-up survey of the position pertaining at 1 September 2001.</P>
    <P>Particular recruitment difficulties arise in the area health boards in the eastern region for city centre areas, areas of high deprivation and those areas bordering other health board areas to which staff will be attracted to vacancies. The costs and availability of accommodation in the eastern region are also a factor.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the recent suspected anthrax scares in this country.</P>
      <P>At my request a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, Director of the Virus Reference Laboratory, was recently established to prepare an operational plan which would be implemented in the event of a biological attack on this country. The committee agreed that in preparing a plan it will be necessary to identify the level of risk of such an attack and that the plan should reflect the risk identified. The committee considered that as the risk of a primary attack on this country was low a plan should therefore, be prepared to cater for a secondary attack.</P>
      <P>While work on the detailed plan is progressing a specific protocol to deal with a suspected anthrax attack was prepared, at my request, in light of the recent anthrax attacks in the United States. I launched this protocol on Wednesday 17 October. Prior to the launch of the protocol I met with members of the committee as well as the gardaí, fire services and Defence Forces. During this meeting the roles of the various bodies were clearly defined and agreed. In addition, I spoke with my counterpart in the UK in order to ensure the absolute safety of our plan. He confirmed that the protocol was similar to that in place in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protocol was prepared by the expert committee and deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax <Col N="248" /> attack including patient treatment and management, post exposure guidelines etc. Guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with a suspect package believed to contain anthrax are included in the protocol.</P>
    <P>The protocol is a work in progress and is being revised on an ongoing basis as a result of feedback to the committee. The protocol and guidelines are available on my Department's web site &ndash; www.doh.ie.</P>
    <P>To date, all suspect samples returned after analysis have proved negative. However, I can assure the Deputy that sufficient quantities of the antibiotic <i>Ciprofloxacin</i> have been secured to treat patients in the event of exposure to anthrax.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, is currently chairing a task force for emergency planning. The role of the task force is to ensure a co-ordinated and comprehensive response in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>The committee chaired by Professor Hall is in the process of finalising a protocol for dealing with other biological agents and this will be issued in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the public that the risk of an anthrax attack in this country is considered to be low and that the guidelines are being issued as a precaution.</P>

      <P>The provision of health centres to meet the needs of local communities within its functional area is a matter for each health board, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of County Kildare, this responsibility rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>As with each of the other boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has been notified of the annual indicative funding available under the national development plan for the period 2001 to 2006 to facilitate the financing of capital projects, including health centres. The identification and prioritisation of projects which may proceed within the indicative funding is a matter for the authority.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I have asked the chief executive officer of the authority to reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>There are ten consultant orthodontists employed in the health boards. The number of specialist orthodontists currently employed in the orthodontic service is not readily available and I will write to the Deputy again in this regard.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have also informed me that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 15,920 patients in orthodontic treatment and 11,995 patients awaiting orthodontic treatment in their boards. The waiting time for treatment varies between 12 to 48 months.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service. These include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics and auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. In addition, six dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health board and South-Eastern Health Board have commenced their training this month for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. This brings the total number in specialist orthodontic training for the health boards to nine.</P>
      <P>The impact of both these structural changes and the orthodontic initiative on the orthodontic treatment waiting lists will be closely monitored by my Department to determine what other measures, if any, are required.</P>

      <P>There is a comprehensive range of obstetric ser<Col N="251" /> vices available to women on a regional and tertiary basis. However, I am aware of recent difficulties relating to the recruitment and retention of midwives which are impacting on the capacity of maternity hospitals to cope with increasing demands for their services, particularly in the eastern region.</P>
      <P>I wish to set the record straight in relation to the extent of the midwifery shortages in the Dublin area. Media reports of 110 midwifery posts vacant in the three Dublin maternity hospitals are incorrect. Information received by my Department indicates that while the three hospitals are short 84 midwives, the net vacancy situation is actually 54 posts, when account is taken of the number of registered general nurses that have been employed by the hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have established a special forum to examine the current difficulties being experienced by the Dublin maternity hospitals in relation to the recruitment and retention of midwifes. This forum includes representatives of the three Dublin maternity hospitals, my Department, the Health Service Employers' Agency, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Nursing Unions. It held its first meeting on 19 October and has been asked to report back to me as a matter of urgency. This forum will build on a number of initiatives already taken at national level to recruit and retain midwifes.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the provision of a comprehensive, safe and high quality, fully accessible obstetric service will continue to be of the utmost priority.</P>

    <P>The remit of the National AIDS Strategy Committee (NASC), which is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, has been extended to include sexually transmitted infections. NASC made a number of recommendations with regard to education and prevention and the treatment of STIs and these recommendations are being implemented.</P>
    <P>Education is an important aspect in raising awareness in the dangers of engaging in risky sexual behaviour which could result in a sexually transmitted infection. Health boards undertake information and awareness activities at regional level and amongst the issues addressed is the prevention of sexually transmitted infection. Where appropriate, the health boards work in conjunction with and fund voluntary organisations in this regard.</P>
    <P>At national level, the health promotion unit of my Department has maintained a sexual health and &ldquo;safer sex&rdquo; awareness programme for a number of years. This programme involves the display of &ldquo;safer sex&rdquo; messages in the toilet areas of places of entertainment frequented by young people, such as pubs and youth clubs. Information literature is also produced.</P>

    <P>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey): The Government's action plan to expand the capacity of the construction industry, of June 2001, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library, explicitly acknowledges the importance of facilitating innovation in construction, including building materials; and sets out actions designed to promote innovation. The building regulations are performance based and permit the use of any building materials, products or systems which meet the minimum performance standards. The choice of building materials for specific building projects is primarily a matter for the client, designer and builder.</P>
    <P>This process can be assisted by independent assessment and approval of building materials, products or systems. The assessment system operated under NSAI Irish Agreement Board is an example of a mechanism that gives assurance of fitness for purpose, in compliance with the building regulations.</P>
    <P>At present, my Department is commissioning a consultancy study designed to identify the conditions for the optimal use of timber frame housing in Ireland, taking account of experience to date in this country and in other countries.</P>

      <P>Building regulations prescribe minimum construction standards for new buildings and extensions and material alterations to existing buildings and certain changes of use of existing buildings. Part D of the regulations requires that work on such buildings be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner.</P>
      <P>Compliance with the regulations is primarily a matter for the designers, builders and owners of the buildings involved. Enforcement of the regulations is the responsibility of local building control authorities. I have consistently urged the relevant authorities to be active in enforcing building regulations and I have taken a number of measures to improve enforcement at local level including, approving the creation of additional posts where necessary, allowing building control officers and support staff to be appointed, increasing building control fees with effect from 1 July 1998, and providing local funding for stricter enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures are yielding results. All but three of the authorities have now appointed building control officers and the remaining authorities are taking steps to do so. About 90% of <Col N="255" /> authorities are now carrying out inspections and three-quarters have reached the target level of inspection &ndash; 12% to 15% of developments &ndash; recommended in 1993 guidelines adopted by the City and County Managers' Association. The minority of local authorities still behind target levels have pledged their commitment to early achievement of the target level.</P>
    <P>I recently addressed the annual conference of the Irish Building Control Institute, IBCI, where I assured all building control personnel attending the conference of my full support for vigorous and sustained enforcement of the building regulations.</P>

      <P>I recognise that unauthorised encampments continue to be a source of concern and contention for both the Traveller and settled communities. The increased provision of accommodation resulting from the implementation of the five-year local Traveller accommodation programmes, including the provision of a network of transient sites throughout the country, is designed to reduce the incidence of illegal encampments.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a range of powers under section 32 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998 in relation to unauthorised Traveller encampments which are on public land and on the roadside, located within specified distances of Traveller accommodation provided by any housing authority or voluntary body with the assistance of a housing authority, or in poor condition or interfere with amenities or are likely to be, or are, a risk to personal or public health or safety.</P>
      <P>There are other powers available to local authorities such as those available under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948 in relation to the prohibition of temporary dwellings in certain areas and controls under environmental, litter, waste management and public health legislation and the legislation relating to the control of dogs and horses. Under the Roads Acts, vehicles must not be parked in a manner which interferes with the normal flow of traffic or which obstructs or endangers other traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community recommends, in its first progress report, that the operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998 Act should be reviewed in 2002, two years into the delivery of the Traveller accommo<Col N="256" /> dation programmes. I envisage that this review will include the provisions for dealing with unauthorised encampments as well as the arrangements for the preparation and implementation of all elements of the local Traveller accommodation programmes.</P>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance, SWA, scheme.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</P>
      <P>The present basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement payable in any individual case was put in place in 1996. The various types of prescribed diets are grouped into two categories, one comprising lower cost diets and the other comprising higher cost diets. Diet supplements are paid subject to a means test and applicants are required to contribute any excess assessable means towards their food costs.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of calculating the rate of diet supplement payable, the lower cost diets were deemed to cost £27, 34.28, per week and the higher cost diets were deemed to cost £35, 44.44, per week. In the case of single people, the amount payable was calculated on the basis that one-third of their income is spent on food. Where the applicant is one of a couple, the amount payable was calculated on the basis that one-sixth of the couple's joint income is spent on the diet supplement applicant's food.</P>
      <P>In the case of a lower cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is £27, 34.28, less one-third of the applicant's income, one-sixth in the case of a couple. In the case of a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is £35, 44.44, less one-third of the applicant's income, one-sixth in the case of a couple. Increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1996 are disregarded for the purposes of this means test as they would have the effect of reducing the rate of diet supplement payable in all cases and would eliminate entitlement altogether in many cases.</P>
      <P>In the case of children under the age of 18 there is a standard rate of £8, 10.16, per week for a higher cost diet and £5, 6.35, per week for a lower cost diet. In the case of persons with dependent children the child dependant's allowance is not assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SWA scheme is currently being reviewed <Col N="258" /> as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations and a fundamental examination of the diet supplement will be undertaken in this context.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. Guidelines on the application of these conditions are made available to deciding officers and are designed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.</P>

    <P>To satisfy the qualifying conditions a person must demonstrate that he or she is making genuine efforts to secure employment having regard to the availability and location of job opportunities.

      <P>There are currently 1,539 applications for carer's allowance awaiting determination. The majority of these claims are at an advanced stage of processing and the backlog of claims has been significantly reduced in recent months. In determining entitlement to carer's allowance there are medical, means and residency conditions which must be satisfied and there is inevitably a timelag involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable decisions to be made.</P>
      <P>The average time for deciding an application for receipt of the allowance in the year to date is 13 weeks. Many applicants for carer's allowance are, however, already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed and such payments will normally continue until entitlement to carer's allowance is determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in recent years there have been a number of significant improvements to the scheme.

      <P>Compulsory social insurance was introduced for the self-employed in 1988. Those liable to contribute include self-employed people with an annual income of £2,500 or more.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered social insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have a minimum number of paid contributions on their record, currently 156 or 260 contributions depending on how the yearly average is calculated, and have a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect or the date of entry into social insurance, if later. A combination of contributions from employment and self-employment may be used to satisfy the qualifying conditions. The qualifying conditions are designed to ensure that those receiving contributory pensions have demonstrated a reasonable attachment to the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>A number of concessions have already been made in relation to self-employed people who became insurable in 1988. A self-employed person who became a contributor on 6 April 1988 and who at any time prior to that date was an employed contributor can have their earlier record disregarded, if it is to their advantage, when their average contribution record is being calculated. A special pension was introduced by me in 1999 for those self-employed who commenced contributions in 1988 but who, at that stage, were already over 56 years of age and could not therefore satisfy the condition that they must have entered insurance ten years before pension age. These measures are a reasonable response to the difficulties which some self-employed experienced when compulsory social insurance was introduced in 1988. The question of making further concessions in this area could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The orphans payments paid by my Department are intended to provide income maintenance for children who satisfy the qualifying conditions. At present orphans contributory allowance and maximum rate orphans non-contributory pension are each paid at a rate of £63.60, 80.76, per week.</P>
      <P>This represents a substantially higher rate than other payments made by my Department in respect of children, namely, child dependant allowance and child benefit. In addition, orphans payments are increased each year in line with the standard budget increases afforded to other income support payments.</P>
      <P>The foster care allowance paid by the health boards is paid at a rate of £200, 253.95, per week in respect of children aged under 12 and £220, 279.34, per week in respect of children aged over 12. Since August 2001 the orphans payment is paid directly to the health boards on behalf of and for the benefit of each child in foster care.</P>
      <P>Foster carers operate within a very specific framework, they are subject to rigorous scrutiny and ongoing monitoring by the health boards and the children in their care are subject to a care plan. This means that foster carers have additional responsibilities and duties in respect of the children in their care, such as working with health board personnel. The report of the working group on foster care noted that foster carers require extra financial support as there are additional costs involved in looking after foster children.</P>
      <P>The two payments systems have significantly different objectives and purposes. The orphans payments, paid by my Department, are designed as income support measures while the foster care allowance not only provides income support but also recognises the additional responsibilities and expenses faced by foster carers.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that there is a case for standardising payments in this area. I am not aware of any cases where the current structure acts as a disincentive for relatives to care for children who have been orphaned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I introduced and which came into effect on 6 July 2000, made provision for significant and far-reaching reforms of the State's liquor licensing laws. With a view to continuing the important work of reforming the liquor licensing code, I established the Commission on Liquor Licensing in November 2000 under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the Commission are as follows: to review the liquor licensing system in the light of all relevant factors, including systems for the licensing of alcohol in other countries, and to make recommendations for a liquor licensing system geared to meeting the needs of consumers, in a competitive market environment, while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society; in particular, to review the scope for a system of additional licences; to examine demand in areas that are under-pubbed, new areas of increasing population, and tourist areas; to examine other aspects of the licensing system, such as licences for theatres and places of public entertainment, the licensing of residential accommodation which does not come under the definition of an hotel, interpretative centres and other places where the sale of alcohol is ancillary to the main business carried out; to examine the nature of the off-licence and particularly the method of access to the off-licensed trade in the interests of promoting better competition; to inquire into other aspects of the licensing code, as may be appropriate; to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes to give effect to the recommendations put forward; to submit a report within three months of the first meeting on paragraph 3 of its terms of reference and a final report within two years of the first meeting on all other matters.</P>
      <P>In line with these terms of reference, the commission presented an interim report on off-licensing to me in April of this year. This report contains recommendations relating to dormant licences, under-age drinking, access to off-licences and certain related matters. I subsequently obtained Government approval to publish the interim report.</P>
      <P>By way of response to the commission's recommendations on access to off-licences, the Government has noted my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in relation to the off-licensed sector at the earliest opportunity. The preparatory work is at an early stage in my Department. This is not a simple task, however, given the complexity of existing legislation in this area. Indeed, the commission itself refers in the interim report to &ldquo;the morass of licensing laws&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government subsequently requested the commission to produce and submit additional <Col N="264" /> interim reports on issues which can be progressed in advance of the commission's final report at the end of 2002. I am pleased to say that the commission has responded positively to this request and I understand that a number of sub-committees have been established to look at specific areas within the liquor licensing code.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission is unable to say at present when further interim reports are likely to be ready for submission.</P>

      <Col N="265" /> In addition, in the case of candidates assessed on parents or guardians income, it is a condition that the parents-guardians must be in receipt of an eligible payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, or from one of the designated programmes, as at 1 April prior to the academic year in relation to which the application is being made, for the purpose of determining eligibility for the special rates.</P>
    <P>The old age non-contributory pension, where child dependent allowance is being paid in respect of the applicant, is an eligible payment under the scheme.

      <P>Hearing impaired students attending courses in third level colleges or institutions and post leaving certificate centres may apply for assistance from the special fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>The fund assists students who have special needs, including deaf and hard of hearing students, in attending third level institutions. The purpose of the fund is to provide grant assistance to students towards the cost of special equipment, including computers, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.</P>
      <P>Applications for assistance under the fund are forwarded to my Department, through the office of the disability officer, or the responsible officer in the college, at the beginning of the academic year.</P>
      <P>The level of funding allocated under the fund for students with disabilities has been increased substantially from IR£250,000, 317,435, in 1998 to IR£1,233,000, 1,565,587, in 2000. Under the 2000 fund, allocations were made to 512 students, including an allocation of over £410,000, 520,593, to 84 students with hearing impairments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Higher Education Authority makes targeted funding available to the universities for initiatives designed to promote access to, and participation in, higher education for students with disabilities. Examples of initiatives funded to date, of particular relevance to deaf <Col N="266" /> and hearing impaired students, include installation of loop systems, assistive technologies, counselling and other student support services, special alarm systems and staff training and awareness development.</P>
    <P>In June, 2000, I announced the establishment of the Irish Centre for Deaf Studies, in Trinity College, Dublin. This centre will offer courses to improve communication between the deaf and hearing communities and to enhance the employment prospects for members of the deaf community.

Courses in the design and delivery of Irish sign language courses are also envisaged.</P>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a comprehensive framework to increase participation in third level education by mature and disadvantaged students and students with disabilities.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Third level institutions in Ireland have certain rights and responsibilities, enshrined in legislation, to determine their own admissions policies. The Universities Act, 1997, requires each university to prepare a statement of its equality policy addressing, <i>inter alia</i>, access of people who have a disability. The Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, sets out in section 7(5) that &ldquo;In performing its functions a governing body shall have regard to the attainment of gender equity and of equality of opportunity in education&rdquo;. The Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, contains a similar provision.</P>
      <P>Students applying for a place in a third level institution generally do so through the Central Applications Office. The CAO processes applications for entry to courses in universities, colleges of education, institutes of technology and other institutions of higher education in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students with disabilities are encouraged to disclose this information when applying to college. Students who indicate a disability in this way, receive a supplementary form, which when <Col N="267" /> completed and returned to the CAO, is circulated to each of the colleges to which the student has applied. The purpose of this process is to alert colleges and universities to the particular needs of students who indicate a disability on the CAO form, so that preparations can be made to provide the necessary supports and to make appropriate arrangements as required. It is essential that third level institutions are informed of the supports that a prospective student may require, so that they may plan in advance.</P>
    <P>Each third level institution has either a disability, or other officer who deals with the needs of students with a disability within the institution. It is important that a student with a disability should introduce him or herself to the disability officer, or other officer with responsibility in that area, when she or he first attends the college. The student will then be informed of the provisions and facilities available in the college and will be offered advice and guidance on relevant issues, for example, academic, administrative, registration and examination matters.</P>
    <P>The special fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by my Department, assists students who have special needs in attending third level institutions. The purpose of the fund is to provide grant assistance to students towards the cost of special equipment, including computers, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. Applications for assistance under the fund are forwarded to my Department, through the office of the disability officer, or the responsible officer in the college, at the beginning of the academic year. In 2000, allocations totalling £1,233,000, 1,565,587, were made to 512 students.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Higher Education Authority provides targeted funding to the universities for initiatives designed to promote access to, and participation in, higher education for students with disabilities. In 2000 a sum of £664,000, 843,106, was made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a comprehensive framework to increase participation in third level education by mature and disadvantaged students and students with disabilities. The report makes a number of recommendations in relation to students with disabilities, including a number that are aimed at ensuring a smooth transition from second level to third level. Implementation of these recommendations is under consideration within my Department in the context of available resources.</P>
    <P>The role of the visiting teacher service includes being available to advise staff in third level institutions and post-school training facilities which may have young people with special needs in their enrolment, including those who are hearing and visually impaired.</P>

      <P>For educational purposes at post-primary level, the country, with the exception of the major cities, is divided into catchment areas, each with a post-primary centre. In order to be eligible for transport under the school transport scheme, pupils must reside at least three miles from and be attending their nearest appropriate post-primary centre. Pupils residing less than three miles from their nearest centre are ineligible but may be allowed transport, subject to there being accommodation on the bus after all fully eligible pupils and catchment boundary pupils have been accommodated.</P>
      <P>Eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from the nearest pick-up point within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided no extra State cost is incurred. These pupils are responsible for making their own way to the catchment boundary pick up point. In circumstances where a school bus has to cross into an adjacent catchment area, because of the local road network or for operational reasons, the bus is not permitted to pick up pupils in that catchment area.</P>
      <P>In order for pupils to be permitted to board the bus, in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, it would be necessary for the catchment boundary between the two centres to be redrawn. This would require the agreement of the schools in the centres involved.</P>

      <P>Swimming is part of the aquatics strand of the revised primary curriculum. The term &ldquo;aquatics&rdquo; is used to include not only the teaching of swimming but also the provision of opportunities for enjoyment of water play. The aquatics programme is designed for implementation at any class level having regard to the availability of a local facility and the readiness of pupils to begin water based activities. Where a local facility exists, I am in favour of swimming being taught to pupils as part of the aquatics programme.</P>
      <P>I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools last year. Under the terms of this grant, all schools designated as disadvantaged plus schools in the rural phase of the breaking the cycle scheme receive an annual grant of £1,000 per school while all other schools receive £500 per school. Circular 28/00 which issued from my Department to all schools in October 2000, outlines specific materials or activities on which schools may spend this grant. The circular specifically states that &ldquo;schools may also wish to use the grant to alleviate the costs incurred with the provision of swimming classes or other similar activities&rdquo;. The 2001 grant issued to all primary schools on 30 March of this year.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 1065 of 3 October 2001, regarding the extension of school transport for a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny, he will outline the conclusion reached in the transport liaison officer's report that the bus is too large to travel the road to collect this child at his home when in fact it is a mini bus which serves this route.</Quest>

      <P>In general, post-primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than two miles to travel to a school bus pick-up point. Home pick-<Col N="271" /> ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently received a report regarding a request for an extension of the school transport service for the pupil, referred to by the Deputy. The pupil resides 1.1 miles from the route of the existing bus service. As this is well within guidelines, it is not proposed to extend the existing service.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the size of bus serving the route, does not affect the issue. However, the matter is being brought to the attention of the transport liaison officer.</P>

      <P>Resource teaching support is allocated to schools to assist children with special needs who are attending school on a fully integrated <Col N="272" /> basis. The level of resource teaching support provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the child or children involved.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate has recently investigated the special educational needs of children attending the school in question. Arising from this investigation, my Department has recently increased the level of resource teaching support provided to the school from five hours per week to 13.5 hours per week. This level of support is considered appropriate having regard to the assessed needs of the children involved.</P>
